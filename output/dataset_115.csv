2759831,Michael v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 164,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  On 19 March 2012, the applicant, Fabian Michael, was committed for trial in respect of an offence of intending to pervert the course of justice contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 319.
2Mr Michael now seeks leave to appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F.  That section provides, relevantly:
""5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order
(1) This section applies to:(a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court ...
...
(3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:(a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal ...
...
(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal:(a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and(b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against ..."" 
Mr Michael would be entitled to seek leave to appeal under s 5F(3) if there was an interlocutory judgment or order made in proceedings.  
3In his notice of application for leave to appeal, Mr Michael identified the interlocutory orders against which he sought leave to appeal as being:
""1. Judgment made by Magistrate Pierce to commit [Mr Michael] to District Court.
2. Order made by Magistrate Pierce to refuse application to exclude written evidence and quash indictment""  
4In his grounds of application, Mr Michael contended that the magistrate erred in failing to comply with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 89 in circumstances where he was unrepresented at the committal hearing.  The particular grounds of his application were as follows:
""The Magistrate did not adhere to this section by reading the prescribed words to [Mr Michael] during the course of the proceedings.
The Magistrate committed [Mr Michael] to the District Court for arraignment based on the written evidence which was tendered by the prosecution.
On application to exclude the written evidence pursuant to a breach of s 89 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the magistrate erred by refusing the application to exclude the evidence and quash the indictment.""  
5Mr Michael sought the following orders:
""1. Indictment be quashed and dismissed.
2. Crown pay costs.""  
6The Criminal Procedure Act, Pt 2, Div 3 makes provision for the manner in which a committal proceeding is to be conducted.  In particular, s 74 provides that the evidence of the prosecution is to be given by way of written statements that are in admissible form.  This procedure is known as a 'paper committal'.  
7The Criminal Procedure Act, s 89 provides:
""89 Notice of rights to unrepresented accused person
(1) In any committal proceedings in which an accused person is not represented by an Australian legal practitioner, a written statement is not admissible unless the Magistrate: 
(a) has explained to the accused person the effect of this Division and the accused person's rights in relation to this Division, and(b) is satisfied that the accused person understands his or her rights under this Division.
(2) The explanation by the Magistrate must be in the form of words prescribed by the rules.""
8One of the 'rights' for which provision is made in Pt 2, Div 3 is contained in s 91 which provides, relevantly:
""91 Witness may be directed to attend
(1) The Magistrate may direct the attendance at the committal proceedings of the person who made a written statement that the prosecution intends to tender as evidence in the committal proceedings. The direction may be given on the Magistrate's own motion or on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor.
(2) The Magistrate must give the direction if an application is made by the accused person or the prosecutor and the other party consents to the direction being given ...""
9On 24 November 2011, when the matter was mentioned before the Local Court, Mr Michael appears to have indicated to the Court that he was to be legally represented.  There was a further mention of the matter on 19 January 2012, when again there appears to have been an indication that Mr Michael was to be legally represented.  The committal hearing then proceeded before the Local Court on 19 March 2012, on which occasion Mr Michael was self-represented.  The committal hearing proceeded on the basis of a brief of evidence that was placed before the magistrate.  The magistrate did not explain to Mr Michael the effect of Pt 2, Div 3 as required by s 89.  
10During the course of the committal hearing, Mr Michael indicated to the magistrate that he wished to seek some advice at the morning tea adjournment.  That advice appears to have been related to the approach Mr Michael wished to take in circumstances where the Commissioner of Police had failed to answer a subpoena.  
11Mr Michael also stated to the magistrate that the informant may be required to be present to give evidence.  After the morning tea adjournment, Mr Michael indicated to his Honour that he wished to proceed.
12Mr Michael then made submissions, including referring the magistrate to a significant quantity of case law.  There was a short further adjournment.  Mr Michael concluded his submissions and the Crown Prosecutor made short submissions to the magistrate.  His Honour found a prima facie case and gave Mr Michael the required warning.  His Honour then asked whether Mr Michael had anything to say in answer to the charge.  Mr Michael indicated that he did not wish to call any evidence but that he wanted ""to make an application ... under s 89 of the Criminal Procedure Act"".
13The magistrate indicated to Mr Michael that he was of the view that as Mr Michael was represented on 19 January 2012 when the matter was set down for a paper committal, it was unlikely that the provisions of s 89 applied.  His Honour offered Mr Michael the opportunity of an adjournment should he wish to put forward any authority for the contention that s 89 applied.  Mr Michael indicated that he did not seek an adjournment and was happy to proceed.  The magistrate then proceeded to commit Mr Michael for trial, having formed the view that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction.
14His Honour may have been in error in stating that Mr Michael was represented on 19 January 2012 and there may in a given case be a question as to whether such warning should be given, particularly where during the course of a proceeding a party ceases to have legal representation.  However, that question does not arise in this case.
15The meaning of ""interlocutory judgment or order"" in s 5F has been given a restricted meaning.  As the Court explained in R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636:
A judgment is the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court.  An order is a command by a court that something be done (or not done).""
16In particular, it has been held that s 5F does not apply to rulings on evidence:  see R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136 at 138;  R v Steffan;  or to a ruling that a witness should not be recalled for further cross-examination:  R v Powch at 138, or to a ruling by a magistrate refusing to give a direction that a person be required to attend for cross-examination:  R v Colby (1995) 84 A Crim R 125.  In Colby, the direction the magistrate refused to give was under the predecessor provision to the Criminal Procedure Act, s 91. 
17In R v Steffan, the Court explained, at 636, why a ruling on evidence did not fall within the meaning of ""interlocutory judgment or order"" within s 5F:
""If the ruling on evidence in this case was either a judgment or order, it was clearly interlocutory in nature.  It is not immediately self-evident as a matter of ordinary usage however ruling on the admissibility of evidence could be entered in the records of the court as a judgment, or how it commands that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court.  It is true that such a ruling may be accompanied (as it was here) by elaborate reasons which have been expressed in a document called a 'judgment', but that is an altogether different usage of the word 'judgment' and denotes the reasons which have been expressed rather than the formal act of the court.""
18A refusal to quash an indictment was assumed to fall within the terms of s 5F:  see R v Waterhouse (1992) 62 A Crim R 59.  The court in that case did not finally determine that question as leave to appeal was refused.
19In the argument on the application before this Court, Mr Michael was asked to identify the judgment or order he contended was an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" for the purposes of s 5F.  He was unable to do so.  This was not surprising, as there was not only no order made by the magistrate pursuant to s 89, the terms of the section are such that no order is required to be made.  Rather, s 89 imposes an obligation upon a magistrate to provide a specified explanation to a person who is self-represented on a committal hearing.  There is no order to be made under the section.  Whatever remedy may lie arising from a failure to comply with s 89, it is not to be found within s 5F. 
20When this was explained to Mr Michael, he submitted it should be inferred that such an order was made and it should be further inferred that the purpose in bringing s 89 to the attention of the magistrate was as a preliminary step in establishing that the statements of evidence upon which the prosecution case relied were inadmissible.  It would follow that there was no evidence before the court upon which the magistrate could have committed him for trial.  The result on this argument was that the indictment, which has been filed in the District Court against Mr Michael, should be quashed.
21These arguments failed to identify an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F.  In the first place, a judgment or order is either made or given, or not.  There is no place for the Court to infer that an order was made.  Secondly, s 89, which was the starting point of Mr Michael's argument, does not require the making of an order, as I have already explained, so s 5F does not come into play.  Thirdly, Mr Michael did not make an application under s 91, but even had he done so, there is authority in this Court to the effect that a refusal to make an order under that section is not an interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F:  see Colby, referred to above.  Finally, a committal for trial involves an administrative or executive act and does not constitute a judgment or order:  see Waterhouse v Gilmore (1988) 12 NSWLR 270.
22The relief sought by Mr Michael is that the indictment be quashed.  The finding of a bill of indictment is a separate act from the act of committal:  see Criminal Procedure Act, s 8(2);  Director of Public Prosecutions v Kolalich (1990) 19 NSWLR 520 at 527.  The only basis upon which that order is sought is the magistrate's failure to comply with s 89.  For the reasons I have given, any such failure is not one that falls for consideration under s 5F.  Accordingly, the basis upon which the order to quash the indictment is sought has not been made out.  
23It follows, therefore, that Mr Michael has not established that there is an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" within the meaning of s 5F from which he seeks leave to appeal.  Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed. 
24HALL J:  I agree with Beazley JA.
25S G CAMPBELL J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA and with her Honour's reasons.

2759836,WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:Offences and sentence The applicant was charged with two counts.
(a)On 17 October 2009 driving in a manner dangerous occasioning the death of Jason Stortz, contrary to s 52A(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum sentence is imprisonment for 10 years.
(b)On 17 October 2009 failing to stop after occasioning the death of Jason Stortz, contrary to s 52AB(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.
2The trial with respect to those counts was fixed for hearing before Conlon DCJ and a jury on 9 February 2011.  Before the trial commenced, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the second count but not guilty in respect of the first.  The trial then proceeded in relation to the first count.  On 23 February 2011 the jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of the first count.
3On 19 April 2011 the applicant was sentenced as follows:  In respect of the second count (failing to stop) he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 9 months, commencing 1 January 2011.  On the first count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing 1 January 2012 and expiring 31 December 2015, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 31 December 2018.  The overall sentence was a non-parole period of 5 years, with a balance of term of 3 years.  His Honour also imposed a licence disqualification of 6 years commencing 19 April 2011.
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal from those sentences.  There are eight grounds of appeal.
Ground of Appeal 1 - The sentencing judge erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the collision was causally connected to the applicant sending a text message on his phone.
Ground of Appeal 2 - The sentencing judge erred in not finding that the offender's ADHD contributed to the commission of the offences in a material way.
Ground of Appeal 3 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the offender's ADHD in relation to his likely experience of imprisonment.
Ground of Appeal 4 - The sentencing judge erred in the way that the offender's youth was taken into account.
Ground of Appeal 5 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper consideration to the applicable sentencing guideline in respect of the offence of culpable driving causing death.
Ground of Appeal 6 - The sentence in respect of the offence of culpable driving causing death is manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 7 - The sentence in respect of the offence of fail to stop is manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 8 - The overall sentence is manifestly excessive.
Background
5On the morning of 17 October 2009 Jason Stortz (the deceased) set off from his home in Kiama riding a new Pinarello bicycle.  He was an experienced triathlete and had competed in the Port Macquarie Ironman Triathlon in 2006, 2007 and 2008.  Ironman events involve a 3.8 km swim, a 100 km bike ride and a full marathon (a 42 km run).  The deceased had been in training for a half Ironman event, scheduled for early November and he intended to compete in 2010 Port Macquarie Ironman.
6On this morning, he was undertaking a time trial with the intention of riding to Berkeley and then undertaking a return journey.  Jamie Williams was a training partner and gave evidence that this was a usual ride and would take him through Albion Park, onto Calderwood Road and onto Marshall Mount Road (the collision scene).
7On that same morning, Alan Onions, another triathlete, was also out on a training ride and when travelling south, saw the deceased cycling towards him on Calderwood Road.  When near the Illawarra Christian School, he stopped and had a conversation with the deceased about their training and what they were doing that morning.  He believed that they parted company at about 8.45am.  
8A very short time after this, Peter Mullen, also a triathlete, saw the deceased riding towards him on Calderwood Road.  He slowed down and they exchanged a few words, with the deceased telling him that he was heading to Berkeley.
9Shortly thereafter, the deceased was cycling in a northerly direction along Marshall Mount Road.  The applicant was travelling south on that same road, towards Albion Park, having picked up a friend, Katie Williams, from her home in Dapto.  He was driving his Ford Falcon sedan when he came into collision with the deceased killing him instantly.  At the collision scene, Marshall Mount Road was a straight stretch of rural roadway, with clear unobstructed vision in both directions for hundreds of metres (up to 800 metres).  The exhibited photographs make that clear and the nature of the unobstructed vision was confirmed when the Court visited the scene of the accident during the trial.
10It was a clear sunny day with excellent visibility.  Marshall Mount Road had an 80 kilometre speed limit.
11Telephone records indicated that the applicant sent a text message at 8.53am to Katie Williams, telling her that he was at the front of her home.  The distance from that location to the collision scene was about 4.6 kilometres.  Telephone records indicated that the applicant sent a text message to Adam McKenna at 8.58am.  At 9.02am a text message was sent from the applicant's telephone to his mother.  This was at a time following the collision.
12Although the applicant was aware that he had collided virtually head on with the cyclist, he did not stop but continued in a southerly direction along Marshall Mount Road.  This was despite pleas from Ms Williams to stop.  The evidence was that following the accident, the applicant was driving at speed and erratically (there was no evidence of erratic driving prior to the collision).
13Mr Robert Downs, a farmer, was driving in a northerly direction and when near the entrance gate to ""Magella Farm"" (1.4 kilometres south of the collision scene) he saw the offender's vehicle coming towards him around a bend.  He said:
""He oversteered, he came back off the road and he was sort of half on the road and half on the grass and I sort of saw that, you know, like he accelerated and he straightened up and I was more or less watching to get out of the road a bit.  I looked in the rear vision mirror then I seen he got back onto the tar.""
14The next person to see the applicant's car was Jarrod Howarth, another cyclist, who was also travelling north.  He said:
""I could hear a car approaching from the opposite direction and then I saw the car and I noticed that the car was driving very fast for this section of road, so I pulled myself off the side of the road to let the car get past me, sort of ...  It travelled past me at quite a high speed for that area of the road and as it went past I noticed it had a smashed window screen .... and then waited 'til it had gone past me and off into the distance and then I started to cycle again.""
15Mr Downs brought his vehicle to a stop when he came upon the collision scene.  He observed various parts of the bike and also noticed three bike riders cycling towards him about 400 metres ahead.  He then saw something in his mirror and he reversed back to where he observed the deceased on the western grass verge.  He got out of his ute and he walked to the deceased.  Three bike riders then arrived, got off their bikes and walked over to Mr Downs, who was then at the back of his ute.  They had a conversation with him and he pointed out the deceased on the grass verge.  After having a close look, one of the riders asked Mr Downs if he had called an ambulance.  Mr Downs said he had not.  Mr Thomas then obtained a mobile telephone from one of the cyclists and called 000.  That call was made at 9.04.28.  
16Meanwhile the applicant drove his car a distance of 7.2 km south to Mellows Road where he drove it into a tree.  
17Telephone records show the applicant receiving the call from his mother at 9.04.14 which lasted 42 seconds, concluding at 9.04.56.  He then received a further call from his mother at 9.06.58 (1 minute 54 duration), from his father at 9.09.03 (43 seconds) and a 000 call was made by the applicant at 9.11.21.
18In that 000 call he said:  ""Just fuckin' hit someone in a car, I've got no licence and I think I'm fucken going to gaol.""  When the operator asked him why he was going to gaol he said ""Because the cunt's dead, I think he's dead, I took off, I freaked and took off"".
19After further telephone calls, one being from his father at 9.19.45 (1 minute 52 duration) the applicant was collected and driven to the intersection (Yallah Road) south of the accident scene.  There he was placed under arrest by police and said: ""The bike was in the middle of the road and I hit him"".  He declined to be interviewed.
20The following two conversations were recorded while the applicant was in a detention centre on remand.  On 19 October 2009 his mother asked ""Where did it happen, was it on the straight?"" to which the applicant replied:
""It was on the straight, I don't know how it happened, like it's definitely got to be fate for the poor bloke because honestly all of a sudden he was just there, I couldn't even see him"".
21On 3 November 2009 he said to his father:
""I wasn't speeding, they can't, how can they tell if I was speeding.  They've already got one thing wrong, they think that I hit from behind, from behind, that's wrong.  I know for a fact that is wrong because I seen his face at the last second before he hit like, like a metre in front of my car, that's why I swerved and tried to avoid it but like he was, like I would have hit him dead centre but I moved, like because I swerved, I hit him on the, I hit on the edge"".
22The passenger, Ms Williams, was not able to assist as to how the collision occurred.  The reason for this was that she was concentrating on her own mobile telephone throughout the trip.  She said that while she was logged onto ""Myspace"", she was actually playing songs from ""My Music"".  She was not observing the road ahead.  She said:
""I was looking down at my phone when I felt the car swerve and I heard a bang and then the glass smash ...  I turned around and looked back and I just saw the bike"".
23Ms Williams acknowledged that the applicant had his telephone in the car.  When asked ""Do you know whether he did use it at all?"" she responded ""Not sure but I didn't see him"".  She said that she was the one who messaged the applicant's mother (at 9.02).  She said that his telephone was near the handbrake.  When his mother called it was the applicant who spoke with her and he did this while driving.
24There was evidence from the Police Crash Investigation Unit and from an expert in motor accident reconstruction, Mr Grant Johnston, that the tyre marks on the road and the debris from the car and the bike were consistent with the car and the bike colliding at an angle and with the point of impact being on the incorrect side of the road from the applicant's point of view by at least three-quarters of a metre across the centre line.  Mr Johnston estimated that the minimum time that the deceased would have been capable of being observed by the applicant at the accident site was between 6 and 9 seconds.  
Sentence proceedings in the District Court
25His Honour made further findings of fact in the sentence proceedings.  His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was not paying attention to the road ahead.  His Honour said:
""He caused his vehicle to move to the incorrect side of the roadway and impact with Mr Stortz's cycle.  Those recorded conversations in the detention centre are, in my view, unequivocal.  He only saw him at the last second before he hit about a metre in front of his car.  He said he swerved and as a result didn't ""hit me dead centre"" but hit him ""on the edge"".
The evidence of Senior Constable Warren and Mr Grant Johnston satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt that the front right hand side of the offender's vehicle impacted Mr Stortz's cycle and it did so at an angle.  Had the offender been observing the road ahead he would have seen Mr Stortz and would have been able to manage his vehicle so it remained on its correct side of the roadway and not stray to the incorrect side.
Was there any evidence to indicate what had diverted the offender's attention from the road ahead?  Ms Williams was totally focused on her own phone.   A text message was sent from the offender's phone at 8.58am to Adam McKenna's phone.  Adam McKenna acknowledged that he had received telephone calls from the offender earlier that morning.  He could not specifically recall what was said in those conversations but generally it was about the offender picking up Katie Williams and driving to Adam McKenna's place at Albion Park.  Adam McKenna could not recall what was in the text message at 8.58am.
Evidence at trial indicated that records in respect of text messages referred only to the minute at which they were sent.  Accordingly, a text recorded at 8.58am could have been sent at any time between 8.58 and 8.58.59 seconds.
...
Ms Williams gave evidence that the offender messaged her at 8.53am ""to come out the front"".  She said that she walked out the front and he ""pulled up just as I came out the front"".  They then travelled to the scene.
Senior Constable Warren gave evidence that he drove from Ms Williams' address to the collision scene and it took 4 minutes and 40 seconds.  He measured the distance as 4.6 kilometres.  He drove at the relevant speed limit.  He conceded if he had to stop at a traffic light along the way the journey would have taken about 5 minutes (I have also considered the evidence of Colin Wingrove on this issue).
I am satisfied on the evidence beyond reasonable doubt that when the offender was sending the text message to Adam McKenna at 8.58am he was driving his car south on Marshall Mount Road.""
26His Honour then analysed the movements of Mr Downs from when he first saw the applicant until driving to the scene of the accident and then the call being made to 000 at 9.04.28.  His Honour took into account the evidence of Mr Thomas (a cyclist) and Ms Jervis (another cyclist) as to their movements to the accident scene.
27His Honour concluded:
""Of course I have also considered the evidence of Mr Onions that he parted company with Mr Stortz at about 8.45am from the Illawarra Christian School.  The distance from there to the collision site was 6.1 kilometres.  Jamie Williams gave evidence that he attempted to replicate the ride and stated that the deceased would have ridden that stretch at about 32 to 33 kilometres per hour.  Of course this can only be a guide but under those conditions Mr Stortz would have taken about 11 minutes to get to the collision scene.  That provides further support for the probability of the collision occurring before 9am.
Accordingly I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference in the circumstances is that shortly before the collision the offender's attention was directed at sending a text message.  After sending the text message the phone is obviously placed in the console and by the time that his attention then turns back to the roadway he has moved to the incorrect side of the road and collided with Mr Stortz.""
28In relation to moral culpability, his Honour referred to the observations of Simpson J in R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32:
""Offences under s 52A are not divided into those of momentary inattention and those of abandonment of responsibility. Those are the two extremes. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offence and it is proper for the courts to recognise a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, when assessing moral culpability.""
29His Honour referred to the guideline judgment in Regina v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 33 NSWLR 202.  In relation to aggravating factors, his Honour noted that Regina v Errington [2005] NSWCCA 348; 147 A Crim R 553 made it clear that the aggravating factors in Whyte were not meant as a check list but as a guide.  His Honour regarded those aggravating factors as ""illustrative not definitive"".
30In relation to abandonment of responsibility, his Honour took into account that the applicant was never licensed to drive and had previously been dealt with by the courts in respect of two charges of driving while unlicensed.  His Honour took into account on that issue the applicant's failure to stop after the collision.  His Honour was satisfied that this failure to stop arose from the combination of his consciousness of wrongdoing and his panic.  On those issues, his Honour referred specifically to R v Woodland [2007] NSWCCA 29 at [39] and R v Shumack [2008] NSWCCA 313; 191 A Crim R 513 at [2] - [4].
31His Honour concluded:
""As a consequence of my abovementioned findings I do not regard the collision occurred as a result of a momentary lapse of attention.  A clear objective indicator of abandonment of responsibility must relate to a circumstance where a driver deliberately uses a phone to text message or otherwise use in a way that causes him to lose control of the vehicle so that the driver is totally oblivious to the fact that his car has moved onto the incorrect side of the road.  Accordingly, he has abandoned his responsibility to other users of the roadway and his moral culpability is high.""  (ROS 10.2)
32With respect to the s 52AB(1) offence, his Honour quoted from the Second Reading Speech of September 2005 where it was said:
""Failure to stop and assist in serious accidents should invite significant punishment.""  (ROS 10.9)
33His Honour was satisfied from what the applicant told his father, from the severe damage to the windscreen directly in front of his face and from the evidence of the expert Mr Grant Johnston as to the trajectory of the deceased's body on impact and the presence of body matter inside in the car, that the applicant was well aware that he had seriously injured the cyclist.  His Honour noted that despite the pleas of Ms Williams and his mother, he continued driving to Mellows Road.  His Honour said:
""When the 000 call was eventually made it appeared his concern was predominantly for himself.""  (ROS 11.4)
His Honour concluded that objectively this was a most serious offence.
34His Honour then considered the applicant's subjective case.  At the time of sentencing the applicant was 18.  He was 17 and 3 months when the accident occurred.  He would turn 19 in three months.  His Children's Court record showed continuous offending since early 2007.  The offences included offensive behaviour, offensive language, three counts of enter premises without lawful excuse, two counts of remain on prescribed premises without lawful excuse and one count of intimidation of school staff.  He had received good behaviour bonds in relation to those matters.  While on those bonds, he had committed a common assault for which he received another bond.  While on that bond in January 2008, he had committed a robbery and was placed on probation for 12 months.  Two months later while on probation, he committed an aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence in company and received a further probation order of 12 months.  Again while on probation, he committed offences of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner.  There were also the two offences of driving while unlicensed, to which reference has already been made.
35His Honour referred to the pre-sentence report.  This showed the following matters.  He had a supportive and uneventful childhood until his mid teenage years.  His behaviour then deteriorated and he was expelled from school for being disruptive.  He had been using cannabis from the age of 14 until approximately four weeks before the accident.  He regularly consumed alcohol, but denied that he had a problem.  In discussions with the Probation Officer, the applicant expressed his sorrow for the victim and the victim's family.  This evidence of remorse was supported by the evidence of his mother.
36A report from Mr Mahoney, a psychologist, was placed before the court.  The applicant informed him that he had been diagnosed with ADHD while in primary school.  He said that he had been medicated on Ritalin but had ceased that medication some time around year 8.  Having reviewed the applicant's medical records, the psychologist concluded that he had suffered from both ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder (ODD) from a young age.
37As a result of tests administered by him, the psychologist concluded that it was ""highly probable"" that the applicant was suffering from ODD.  He then said:
""It is extremely difficult to determine to what extent Mr W's ADHD may have caused or contributed to either his inattention at the time of the accident or his leaving the scene of the accident.""
38His Honour was not prepared to find that the ADHD had been affecting the applicant at the time of the accident.  In that regard, his Honour referred to the evidence of the applicant's mother to the effect that in the four weeks leading up to the accident, he had been behaving very well, had been drug free and had obtained employment with a rigging company.  His employer, who had known the family for many years, confirmed the evidence of the applicant's mother to the effect that to his observation the applicant had matured considerably.
39His Honour concluded:
""I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his ADHD contributed to the commission of these crimes in any material way.""  (ROS 15.5)
40In relation to the applicant's youth, his Honour determined that the usual considerations that punishment and general deterrence might be given less weight in favour of rehabilitation, did not have the same application when sentencing for offences that were regularly committed by young persons.  His Honour said:
""Inexperience and immaturity in persons aged 17 years and over cannot operate as mitigating factors where the offender commits grave driving offences with fatal consequences (TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28 per Howie J at [33]).""
In the circumstances of this case his Honour regarded ""general deterrence as very important and in fact a ""dominant"" factor.""
41Because the applicant had pleaded guilty, albeit somewhat late to thes 52AB(1) offence, his Honour assessed the utilitarian value of the plea at 10 percent.
42His Honour was satisfied that the applicant had demonstrated some remorse and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.  Nevertheless, his Honour was satisfied that nothing other than a custodial sentence was appropriate.  His Honour said:
""The message needs to be delivered that when a driver causes his car to pass onto the incorrect side of the road causing a head on collision resulting in death, it is not merely bad luck, it is criminal conduct that should attract significant punishment.  It is an all too common occurrence that innocent people die at the hands of drivers who do not keep their vehicles on their side of the roadway.""  (ROS 16.9)
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the collision was causally connected to the applicant sending a text message on his phone.
43The applicant submitted that on the evidence looked at as a whole, it was not reasonably open to his Honour to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a connection between the making of the text message at 8.58am and the collision. 
44The applicant supported this submission by reference to the calculations which the judge had used, starting with the applicant's text to Ms Williams that he was outside her house at 8.53am and concluding with Ms Williams' use of the telephone at 9.02am.  The applicant referred to the imprecision and lack of detail underlying those figures.  In particular, it was not known how long it took Ms Williams to move from her house to the car and when it was that the car actually left her house.  Similar criticisms were made of the estimates of time and movement by the police officer who retraced the applicant's route to the accident scene and the movements of Mr Thomas, Mr Downs and Mr Onions.  The applicant's submission was that the number of unknowns and lack of precision in those calculations meant that they could not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt.
45The applicant submitted that in its submissions at trial, the Crown had not only put to the jury the possibility that the applicant had been texting at or about the time of the collision, but that he may have been distracted by his girlfriend.  The applicant submitted that this was an equally likely hypothesis.
46The approach which this Court should adopt to challenges to fact finding of this kind was examined in Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284.  Whichever approach is followed, the task confronting the applicant is a difficult one.  There Basten JA said:
""5The present case involved findings by way of inference drawn from a statement of facts, agreed between the parties. No relevant oral evidence was adduced. 
6On the basis of the conversation between the Applicant and the undercover operative, occurring in circumstances otherwise revealed by the agreed facts, the sentencing judge inferred, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Applicant had access to and was in a position to supply the ecstasy tablets which he had offered to supply. 
7It is not in doubt that such a finding was open to the trial judge. Nor was it in doubt that the trial judge fully understood that such a finding, being adverse to the interests of the offender, could only be made if the facts were established beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27] (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ). His Honour used that language and, being an experienced trial judge, undoubtedly understood what was required. 
8At times the Applicant's submissions appeared to adopt the proposition that if an alternative reasonable inference were open, the finding could not stand. That statement, however, elides the distinction between the assessment made by the sentencing judge and that which might be made by this Court, if it were to form and act upon its own view of the agreed facts. If his Honour were not bound to accept the alternative inference, but was entitled to dismiss it as not raising a reasonable doubt in his mind, he was entitled to reach the impugned finding. The boundary between a difference of opinion and a finding of error may not be a bright line, but it involves a distinction which must be respected.""
47Johnson J, with whom Adams J agreed, said:
""33Ground 1 seeks to challenge a finding made by the sentencing Judge. This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108.
34It is important to keep in mind the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court where a finding of a first-instance Judge is challenged on appeal. A frequently cited and applied statement of principle is that of Hunt J (Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing) in R v O'Donoghue at 401: 

""It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this court is not by way of re-hearing. An appeal which is not by way of re-hearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below: A-G v Sillem (1864) 10 HLC 704 at 724; 11 ER 1200 at 1209; Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 109. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: see Regina v Merritt & Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 372-373; Regina v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 60-61.""
35This statement has been applied in a multitude of cases, including sentence appeals where a finding of fact is challenged on appeal: R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505 at [38]-[41]; R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [60]-[61]; Kardoulias v R [2005] NSWCCA 456; 159 A Crim R 252 at 265 [56]; Camm v R [2009] NSWCCA 141 at [68]-[70]; SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 198 A Crim R 219 at 335 [75].""
48The submissions made by the applicant concerning the lack of detail and therefore lack of precision in the various estimates made by his Honour concerning the timing of movements of various people and in particular, the movement of the applicant between Ms Williams' house and the accident site, have some force.  However, they misunderstand the purpose for which his Honour was using those estimates and they refer to only part of the evidence on which his Honour relied in making his findings.
49It is clear from the calculations to which his Honour referred that a reasonable estimate of the movements of the persons to which his Honour referred, in particular the applicant, are consistent with the accident occurring somewhere along an 8.58 - 8.59am timeline.  As his Honour appreciated, that is as precise as the figures and estimates would allow.  It is when those estimates are taken with the other persuasive evidence that it becomes clear that his Honour's finding was open to him.
50The other evidence comprised the findings of the Crash Investigation Unit and the engineering expert, Mr Johnston.  Their evidence made it clear that the point of impact was on the applicant's incorrect side of the road.  There was evidence from the applicant's statements to other persons and from Ms Williams that there was a sudden swerve by the applicant's car immediately before impact.  Even so, impact occurred at an angle on the incorrect side of the road.
51Consistent with the expert opinion and those statements, it was open to his Honour to conclude that immediately before the accident, the applicant's vehicle was on its incorrect side of the road and that at the last moment the applicant became aware of that fact and swerved to bring the vehicle back onto its correct side of the road.
52Given the 800 metres of open road and clear observation available to the applicant, some explanation more than momentary inattention (covering the 6 - 9 second minimum timeframe) needed to be identified which would allow his vehicle to have moved substantially onto its incorrect side of the road, requiring a sharp swerve to correct the situation.  The only reasonable explanation was that arrived at by his Honour, i.e. that it was part of the texting process - either the texting itself and/or replacing the telephone afterwards - which had allowed the vehicle to substantially stray onto its incorrect side of the road.
53There was a compelling inference that it was this sequence of events which caused the accident and it was well open to his Honour to make the finding which he did beyond reasonable doubt.  The inference was fully consistent with the post accident comments of the applicant and there was no evidence to contrary effect.
54This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in not finding that the offender's ADHD contributed to the commission of the offences in a material way.
Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the offender's ADHD in relation to his likely experience of imprisonment.
55The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in relation to his treatment of the ADHD condition when he said: 
""Little information has been provided as to whether the offender continued to be affected by the said disorder at around the time of the offence"".  (ROS 14.8)
56The applicant submitted that there was no question that he was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of six, and that when tested in April 2011 it was ""highly probable that he continues to suffer from ADHD"".  Mr Mahoney described some of the symptoms of ADHD which was ""characterised by the co-existence of attentional problems impulsivity and hyperactivity"".  Having reviewed the applicant's medical history, Mr Mahoney expressed the opinion that it was likely that his ADHD affected him to some degree at the time of the offence, particularly around the area of inattention on the road.  The applicant submitted that his Honour erred when he failed to take account of that opinion of Mr Mahoney.
57The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to have any regard to the opinion of Mr Mahoney that ""individuals with ADHD may have particular difficulty in conforming to the expectations of this environment such as attending to instructions on taking on tasks that require extended periods of attention"".  The applicant submitted that his Honour should have taken that opinion into account on the question of whether his experience of imprisonment would be more difficult than that of the general prison population.  The applicant submitted that this was an important principle to be taken into account on sentencing.  Its importance had been recently affirmed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
58His Honour was entitled to treat the evidence of Mr Mahoney in the way in which he did.  On that issue, the cautionary observation of Johnson J in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No 36) [2008] NSWSC 626 is pertinent.  There his Honour said:
""164A number of psychologists gave oral evidence.  In approaching their evidence, I keep in mind that it is important that psychologists do not cross the barrier of their expertise.  It is appropriate for persons trained in the field of psychology to give evidence of the results of psychometric and other psychological testing, and to explain the relevance of those results, and their significance so far as they reveal or support the existence of brain damage or other recognised mental states or disorders.  It is not, however, appropriate for them to enter into the field of psychiatry:  R v Peisley (1990) 54 A Crim R 42 at 52."" 
59An analysis of the report of Mr Mahoney indicates that he did cross that line.  Having reviewed the applicant's medical history, Mr Mahoney said:
""In relation to the offending behaviour, it is extremely difficult to determine to what extent Mr W's ADHD may have caused or contributed to either his inattention at the time of the accident or his leaving the scene of the accident.  In part this is also due to the fact that Mr W has significant difficulty remembering details of the accident due to his own trauma around the event.  What is clear is that he was not receiving treatment (medication) at the time of the offending behaviour.  It is also clear that throughout his life (including at the time of the offences) he has had general problems with inattention and impulsivity.  Therefore it is likely that Mr W's ADHD condition affected him to some degree at the time of the offence, particularly around the area of inattention on the road.  There is little evidence to suggest he would have intended to have caused harm to the victim.  It is highly probable that his impulsiveness (also a factor in ADHD) contributed to his rash decision of leaving the scene of the accident immediately after it occurred.
With regard to commenting on the impact of a custodial sentence on Mr W given his history of ADHD, there is some research about the vulnerabilities of people with ADHD in the prison system.  In detention, individuals with ADHD may have particular difficulty in conforming to the expectations of this environment, such as attending to instructions or taking on tasks that require extended periods of attention.  People with ADHD symptoms who are incarcerated have been found to be more disruptive (verbal aggression, damage to property) than a non-ADHD control group.""
Of significance is a further observation by Mr Mahoney that despite his ADHD ""he does not suffer from a serious mental illness"".  
60It was open to Mr Mahoney to test the applicant for indications that at the time of testing he was suffering from ADHD.  He could describe the characteristics of the condition of ADHD.  What he could not do as a psychologist was to express an opinion as to whether and to what extent the ADHD condition affected the applicant at the time of the offence.  Counsel for the applicant, in the sentencing proceedings, could make a submission to his Honour linking the test results and the characteristics which can be experienced by somebody with ADHD.  His Honour could accept that submission but was not obliged to do so.
61In this case, his Honour placed greater weight as he was entitled to do, on the observations of the applicant's mother and Mr Chesher that the applicant's demeanour and behaviour in the four weeks before the accident indicated a significant improvement in his approach to life and maturity.
62In relation to Mr Mahoney's evidence concerning the impact of a custodial sentence on a person with ADHD, Mr Mahoney was entitled to bring to his Honour's attention some research on that issue.  That research indicated that ""individuals with ADHD may have particular difficulty in certain aspects of their imprisonment"".  He could not say and did not say that this would affect the applicant in such a way.  There was no evidence to that effect.
63No error has been identified in how his Honour dealt with the evidence of Mr Mahoney.  These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in the way that the offender's youth was taken into account.
Ground 5 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper consideration to the applicable sentencing guideline in respect of the offence of culpable driving causing death.
Ground 6 - The sentence in respect of the offence of culpable driving causing death is manifestly excessive.
Ground 7 - The sentence in respect of the offence of fail to stop is manifestly excessive.
Ground  8 - The overall sentence is manifestly excessive.
64These Grounds of Appeal raise essentially the same issue and are dealt with together.  
65The applicant accepted that when sentencing for driving offences, because of the tendency of young drivers to drive dangerously and thus the greater prevalence of driving offences committed by young persons, general deterrence might be regarded as a ""prominent factor"".  He submitted, however, that his Honour erred in this case when he said that he regarded general deterrence as ""a dominant factor"".  The applicant submitted that ""prominent"" was not the same as ""dominant"" and that his Honour erred in substantially subordinating considerations relating to his youth to the concept of general deterrence.  The applicant submitted that his youth and the need to foster rehabilitation had to be given appropriate weight.  In this case his Honour's finding was that the applicant had ""good prospects of rehabilitation"".
66The applicant submitted that although he referred to the guideline judgment in Whyte, his Honour had failed to properly apply it.  A consideration of the ""typical case"" referred to by Spigelman CJ at [204] would have shown that the applicant had most of those characteristics.  The applicant submitted that by reference to the aggravating factors referred to by Spigelman CJ at [216], it was clear that few applied to him.  That being so, the marked contrast between the sentence imposed by his Honour of 7 years for the first count when the guideline referred to 3 years indicated that his Honour had failed to take the guideline judgment properly into account.
67In relation to manifest excess, the applicant referred to three decisions Hedges v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 263; Preston v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 25 and Regina v Errington.  The applicant submitted that those three cases involved facts very similar to this case, but the sentences imposed were considerably less, i.e. 2 ½ years - 3 years.  In Hedges a 19 year old driver had failed to pay attention to oncoming traffic and had deliberately crossed over double lines, resulting in a head on collision causing death.  In Preston a 50 year old with a good driving record had deliberately driven through a 'give way' sign in circumstances of limited visibility resulting in a collision and death.  In Errington a 49 year old truck driver had failed to give proper attention to a red light signal and collided with cars causing death.  In Hedges and Preston there were pleas of not guilty and in Errington there was a plea of guilty.
68The applicant submitted that in relation to the fail to stop offence, a fixed term of 2 years and 9 months was equivalent to a non-parole period so that the head sentence would have been 3 years and 8 months.  He submitted that such a sentence was manifestly excessive, bearing in mind the maximum penalty of 10 years and the guilty plea.  The applicant also relied upon the fact that he eventually made a 000 call and that even if he had stopped, he could have done nothing for the deceased.
69The distinction sought to be made by the applicant between the words ""dominant"" and ""prominent"" is a matter of semantics, rather than principle.  Whichever word is used, the effect of what his Honour did is clear, i.e. that in relation to this offence because of the prevalence of young offenders, general deterrence is to be regarded as more important than the need for rehabilitation.  In R v Scott [1999] NSWCCA 233 Levine J (with whom Smart AJ agreed) referred to the importance of general deterrence in the following terms:
""17    His Honour paid particular regard to the consideration which is of paramount importance in a case in respect of this offence, namely general deterrence. Offences under section 52A are public offences. Everyone has some idea of what they are about. Everyone is involved as a driver, passenger or pedestrian with what goes on on the highways and streets of this State. It is a very public crime. The public are entitled to have sentences imposed that make it perfectly clear that conduct of this kind in an environment in which so many of the public are involved in their daily affairs, will be appropriately punished.""
70Although this was a decision of the Court with a bench of two judges, there is nothing contrary to principle in that statement, which was applied and adopted by a three judge Court in R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [101]..
71In TG v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 28 Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed, observed to similar effect:
""33 Thirdly, evidence from a psychiatrist as to the immaturity of young males of the age of the applicant was irrelevant. If a young male is old enough to be licensed to drive a motor vehicle, he is to be assumed to be mature enough to comply with its conditions and the traffic rules. In SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 53 MVR 438 at 151 Johnson J stated: 
""[151] Ms Francis referred in submissions to the Applicant ""having little appreciation of his own mortality"" (T5.35, 22 June 2009). The Applicant's counsel in the District Court had submitted that ""it is also a fact of life that people at this tender age tend to - their brains tend to not allow them to deal with the responsibility that they sometimes demand so vocally"".  In a similar vein, the sentencing Judge in the Victorian County Court in Neethling at [51] had observed that the offender ""like many young men ... saw [himself] as 'bullet proof'."" The fact that young men (in particular) may have such perceptions is a significant reason for general deterrence to be a prominent factor in cases such as these. Inexperience and immaturity, in persons aged 17 years and over, cannot operate as mitigating factors where the offender commits grave driving offences, with fatal consequences, as exemplified by Neethling and this case.""
The reference to ""Neethling"" was a reference DPP v Neethling [2009] VSCA 116; (2009) 52 MVR 422.""
72In any event, his Honour did not ignore rehabilitation but made specific findings which were favourable to the applicant in relation to it.  A matter to which his Honour did not refer but which was relevant was specific deterrence.  Even though the applicant appeared to have improved his behaviour somewhat in the weeks leading up to the accident, his poor criminal record and persistent driving while unlicensed made that principle relevant and applicable.
73Accordingly, his Honour did not err in the way in which he took into account the applicant's youth.
74There was no error in his Honour's approach to Whyte to which he specifically referred.  In Regina v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 Howie J said:
""21 But the factors in the list set out in Whyte, as indicative of a typical case, do not operate as a checklist, the presence or absence of characteristics having some mathematical relationship with the sentence to be imposed. They merely describe the typical case and were not intended to circumscribe the sentencing judge's discretion in the way the applicant suggests.  If the applicant does not fall within a typical case for whatever reason, then the guideline is of less assistance than it might otherwise have been. The applicant fell outside the typical case of an offender to be sentenced for dangerous driving for a number of reasons and, therefore, the guideline had less influence upon the exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion.""
75In this case, the applicant did not conform to the ""typical case"" in three respects.  He was not of good character with no or limited prior convictions and there was no plea of guilty.  In relation to genuine remorse, his Honour found some remorse but that finding was not unqualified. 
76It should also be noted that the Court in Whyte was careful not to be unduly prescriptive in setting out a range of sentences for a ""typical case"".  The Court made no reference to the upper limits of such a sentence but endeavoured to indicate a lower limit for a typical case below which a sentence would not generally be appropriate.  The Court said:
""229 The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 
Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.""""
77As was made clear in Regina v Errington, the critical consideration to emerge from Whyte is the assessment of moral culpability, ranging from low (momentary inattention) to high (an abandonment of responsibility).  As his Honour noted in his reference to R v Khatter, there is a continuum between those two extremes along which a court has to make an assessment of moral culpability.  His Honour assessed the moral culpability of the applicant in this case as high.
78In oral submissions that assessment by his Honour was criticised.  The applicant submitted that texting was not to be considered in the same way as excessive speed, or driving when one's ability to control a car had been substantially affected by drugs or alcohol.  It is clear that opinions might differ on such matters.  As Spigelman CJ said in Whyte:
""220 I said [at 231F] that the formulation of whether ""the relevant aggravating factor manifest[s] in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct"" involves an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ.""  (the reference to 231F is to R v Jurisic [1998] 45 NSWLR 209).
79In assessing moral culpability, his Honour appropriately took into account that the applicant was never licensed to drive, had been convicted on two occasions of driving while unlicensed and yet shortly before the accident had purchased the car which was involved.  The applicant's failure to stop was relevant, although its importance was limited given that it formed the basis of the second offence (Shumack v R [2008] NSWCCA 311; 191 A Crim R 513 at [32] - [34]).
80His Honour considered that the deliberate use of a telephone to text a message so that the driver was totally oblivious to the fact that the car had moved onto the incorrect side of the road and had thereby lost control of the car, was an important factor in his assessment of the moral culpability of the applicant as high.  That was a conclusion well open to his Honour.  
81Contrary to the oral submissions of the applicant, an activity which so occupies the attention of a driver that he does not or cannot observe the road for at least six - nine seconds and allows his vehicle to veer onto the wrong side of the road is tantamount to driving with one's eyes closed.  It is an activity deliberately undertaken and it is an activity which is highly dangerous.  The fact that many young people misguidedly engage in such an activity while driving does not reduce the moral culpability of the conduct.  On the contrary, as his Honour appreciated, it is a further justification for why general deterrence was so important in this matter.
82It follows that the ground of appeal asserting a failure on his Honour's part to follow Whyte has not been made out.
83The imposition of a fixed term of 2 years and 9 months with just 12 months to serve after an adjustment for concurrency and after a 10 percent discount for his late plea has not been demonstrated to be wrong or plainly unjust.
84His Honour accepted that there was an element of panic in the applicant's decision to continue driving.  There was, however, as his Honour also appreciated, the motivation of avoiding detection.  It required a considerable amount of intervention by his girlfriend, his mother and his father before the applicant was prepared to accept some responsibility for what he had done.
85The applicant's responsibility for failing to stop after the accident is not mitigated because in practical terms there was little he could have done for the deceased.  The applicant did not know that for certain.  All that he knew was that there had been a very serious collision and that at the very least, the deceased would have been seriously injured.  As the second reading speech to which his Honour referred made clear the focus of the offence is to ensure that assistance for victims of serious motor vehicle impacts is provided as soon as possible.  Such assistance may save life, minimise injury, improve the prospect of recovery and relevantly in this instance, preserve the dignity of the deceased.
86Ground of Appeal 7 has not been made out.
87The applicant's submission that the sentence for the s 52A(1)(c) offence is manifestly excessive is based on the three cases to which the Court's attention was drawn and on the general proposition that, by reference to statistics generally, this was one of the heaviest sentences imposed for such an offence.
88Little assistance is given by a close examination of the facts in the three decisions relied upon by the applicant.  As those decisions themselves make clear, each was very much dependent upon its own facts.  In this case, his Honour examined the precise nature of the offending in considerable detail.  His Honour concluded, as he was entitled to do, that this was a particularly serious example of such an offence.  In contrast to the somewhat dismissive way in which texting while driving was dealt with in submissions, his Honour regarded that activity as involving a serious dereliction of a driver's responsibility to other road users.  Not only was it open to his Honour to make such an assessment of the objective seriousness of the circumstances surrounding this accident but he was justified in doing so.  The moral culpability of the applicant was as his Honour found, high.  His Honour's focus was on the actual facts of the case before him, not on statistics or the facts on which decisions in other cases were based.
89The limited function of statistics was reaffirmed by the High Court in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520.  The Court noted that ""care must be taken however in using what has been in other cases"" [53].  The Court approved the observations of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 243 FLR 28.
""54In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said:
""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" 
But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"". When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".""
90With that guidance in mind and by reference to the particular facts of this case, the applicant has not demonstrated that the sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years with respect to the s 52A(1)(c) offence was manifestly excessive.  It follows that Grounds of Appeal 6 and 8 have not been made out.
91The orders which I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal is granted.(2)The appeal is dismissed.
92JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.

The appellant was employed by the respondent as a mountain awareness officer. On Sunday 15 July 2007 in the course of his work, he was involved in a skiing accident when struck by a snow boarder. The appellant suffered serious injuries and brought proceedings in negligence against the respondent. The proceedings were heard before Robison DCJ and by judgment dated 1 August 2011 his Honour found in favour of the respondent.

4The appellant challenges the decision of Robison DCJ on two bases:

(i) Having regard to Division 3 of Part 6 of Chapter 7 of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 (the WIM Act) the respondent (as the defendant employer) was not entitled to dispute its liability to the appellant (as plaintiff) so that the only issue that should have been entertained was the assessment of damages.

(ii) If the question of the respondent's liability was properly entertained on the merits, it should have been determined in favour of the appellant.

5The first basis for challenging his Honour's decision arises from the judgment of Robison DCJ of 26 July 2011 in which his Honour dismissed the appellant's Notice of Motion to strike out that part of the respondent's Defence which disputed liability. As well as raising that matter in his Notice of Appeal by Summons filed 27 September 2011 the appellant also seeks leave to appeal against his Honour's dismissal of the Notice of Motion.

6By Notice of Contention directed at the appellant's challenge to his Honour's dismissal of the Notice of Motion, the respondent contends that if the Court decides to re-exercise his Honour's discretion, his Honour should have held that the appellant waived any default by the respondent under s 316(2) and s 318(1) of the WIM Act, or had elected to compromise by agreement interlocutory disputes about pre-filing requirements arising from those sections or was estopped from insisting upon the respondent being held to those sections but does not seek a discharge or variation of any part of the orders made by his Honour.

Summons for leave to appeal

7Objection was taken by the respondent to the appellant filing the Summons for Leave to Appeal on 27 September 2011 when a Notice of Appeal, including the same issue, had been filed on 23 August 2011. The point taken by the respondent is correct. The appellant had an appeal as of right, following his Honour's judgment on 1 August 2011. It is trite law that in an appeal from a final order, an appellate court can correct any interlocutory order which affected the final result (Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 22; 209 CLR 478 at 482-484 per Gaudron, McHugh and Hayne JJ and pp 494-497 Kirby and Callinan JJ).

8Accordingly, the filing of a separate Summons by the appellant was unnecessary and an abuse of process. To the extent that the filing of that Summons caused the respondent to incur additional costs, those costs should be paid by the appellant.

Motion to strike out liability parts of Defence

9In order to understand the rationale behind the motion, it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the WIM Act. These sections are to be found in Part 6 of Chapter 7 of the WIM Act:

""313 Threshold dispute prevents service of pre-filing statement and commencement of court proceedings

If there is a dispute as to whether the degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker resulting from an injury is sufficient for an award of damages, the claimant cannot commence court proceedings for the recovery of work injury damages and cannot serve a pre-filing statement under Division 3 unless the degree of permanent impairment has been assessed by an approved medical specialist under Part 7.

314 What constitutes threshold dispute

(1) For the purposes of this Part, there is considered to be a dispute as to whether the degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker resulting from an injury is sufficient for an award of damages if: 

(a) the person on whom the claim is made has not accepted that the degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker resulting from the injury is at least 15%, or

(b) there is a dispute as to whether the degree of permanent impairment resulting from the injury is fully ascertainable.

(2) There is considered to be no dispute as to whether the degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker resulting from an injury is sufficient for an award of damages if: 

(a) the person on whom the claim is made has accepted that the degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker is at least 15%, or

(b) an approved medical specialist has given a medical assessment certificate certifying that the degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker is at least 15%.

315 Requirement for pre-filing statement before commencing court proceedings

(1) Before a claimant can commence court proceedings for the recovery of work injury damages, the claimant must serve on the defendant a ""pre-filing statement"" setting out such particulars of the claim and the evidence that the claimant will rely on to establish or in support of the claim as the Rules may require. 

(2) The pre-filing statement cannot be served unless: 

(a) the person on whom the claim is made wholly disputes liability for the claim, or

(b) the person on whom the claim is made has made an offer of settlement to the claimant pursuant to the determination of the claim as and when required by section 281 and 1 month has elapsed since the offer was made, or

(c) the person on whom the claim is made has failed to determine the claim as and when required by section 281.

316 Defendant must respond to pre-filing statement

(1) The defendant must, within 28 days after the pre-filing statement has been served on the defendant, respond to the pre-filing statement by: 

(a) accepting or denying liability (wholly or in part), and

(b) (to the extent, if any, that the defendant does not accept liability) serving on the claimant a defence to the claim setting out such particulars of the defence and evidence that the defendant will rely on to defend the claim as the Rules may require.

(2) If the defendant fails to respond to the pre-filing statement as required by this section within 42 days after it is served on the defendant, the claimant can commence court proceedings for the recovery of work injury damages.

317 Defective pre-filing statement

(1) The defendant is not entitled to assert that a pre-filing statement served by the claimant is defective (by reason of incompleteness or otherwise) unless the defendant has notified the claimant, giving details of any alleged defects, within 7 days after the pre-filing statement is served by the claimant.

(2) A dispute as to whether a pre-filing statement served by the claimant is defective may be referred to the Registrar for determination.

(3) The Registrar may give a direction to the claimant as to the action necessary to cure any defect in the pre-filing statement served by the claimant. If the claimant fails to comply with the Registrar's direction within the time allowed for compliance, the pre-filing statement served by the claimant is taken not to have been served. 

(4) If the documents and information that comprise the pre-filing statement are furnished to the defendant at different times, the pre-filing statement is not considered to have been served on the defendant until the last of the required documents and information is served.

318 Parties limited to pre-filing statement and defence

(1) For the purposes of court proceedings on a claim for work injury damages: 

(a) the claimant is not entitled to file a statement of claim that is materially different from the proposed statement of claim that formed part of the pre-filing statement served by the claimant, except with leave of the court, and

(b) the defendant is not entitled to file a defence that is materially different from any defence served on the claimant in response to the claimant's pre-filing statement within 42 days after service of the pre-filing statement, except with leave of the court, and

(c) the defendant is not entitled to file a defence that wholly or partly disputes liability for the claim if the defendant has failed to serve on the claimant a defence to the claim as required by this Division within 42 days after the claimant served the pre-filing statement on the defendant, and

(d) a party to the proceedings is not entitled to have any report or other evidence admitted in the proceedings on the party's behalf if the report or other evidence was not disclosed by the party in a pre-filing statement or defence served under this Division, except with leave of the court.

(2) The court is not to grant leave under this section unless satisfied that: 

(a) the material concerned was not reasonably available to the party when the pre-filing statement or defence was served, and

(b) the failure to grant leave would substantially prejudice the party's case.

(3) The regulations may provide for exceptions to this section.""

10Rule 17.7 of the Workers Compensation Commission Rules 2006 (WCCR) (now repealed) is also relevant. It provided:

""17.7 (Defective pre-filing statement)

(1) A claimant who has been notified in accordance with section 317(1) of the 1998 Act in respect of the claimant's pre-filing statement must, within 7 days of being so notified, serve on the defendant advice as to whether the claimant accepts or denies that the pre-filing statement is defective, and in what detail and to what extent.

(2) Where a claimant has served advice in accordance with sub-rule (1) and has not, within 7 days of that service, been notified by the defendant that the defendant no longer alleges that the pre-filing statement is defective, the claimant must lodge:

(a) a copy of the pre-fling statement, and

(b) a copy of the defendant's notification and the claimant's advice referred to in sub-rule (1), and

(c) a request that the dispute be referred to the Registrar for determination under s 317(2) of the 1998 Act,

and on the same day serve the request on the defendant.

(3) Where a claimant does not comply with sub-rule (1), or, where sub-rule (2) applies, the pre-filing statement is taken not to have been served.

(4) Where a claimant requests in accordance with this rule that a dispute be referred to the Registrar for determination under s 317(2) of the 1998 Act, and lodges a certificate certifying service of the request on the defendant within 2 working days of that service, the dispute is so referred.

(5) Where a dispute is referred for determination in accordance with sub-rule (4), and the Registrar determines that the pre-filing statement is defective, the pre-filing statement is, in accordance with s 317(4) of the 1998 Act, considered to have been served on the date of service on the defendant of the last document or information required to cure the defect.

(6) Where a dispute is referred for determination in accordance with sub-rule (4), and the Registrar determines that the pre-filing statement is not defective, the Registrar may direct that the pre-filing statement be considered to have been served on the date when it was in fact served or a subsequent date.

(7) Where a defendant has given notification in accordance with s 317(1) of the 1998 Act, and subsequently in respect of the same claim serves a pre-filing defence as referred to in rule 17(5):

(a) despite any application of sub-rule (3) the pre-filing statement is taken to have been served, and

(b) the defendant is taken to have waived any objection to the defects alleged in the notification.""

11The general scheme of Part 6 of Chapter 7 of the WIM Act is for the Commission to control various preparatory steps before proceedings are commenced in a court. That is why proposed pleadings, with their supporting documents, are referred to as ""pre-filing statements"" and ""pre-filing defences"". It is only when all of the steps have been satisfactorily completed and a mediation has taken place pursuant to s 318A, that a Statement of Claim can actually be filed in a court. The purpose of Part 6 is to ensure full disclosure of the position of the parties so that by mediation and otherwise the prospects of settlement can be fully explored.

12WCCR 17.7 is part of a comprehensive set of rules commencing with WCCR 17.1 up to WCCR 17.12 which set out requirements as to ""threshold disputes, the pre-filing statement, material to be served with the pre-filing statement, the pre-filing defence, material to be served with the pre-filing defence, directions for access to information and premises and referral to mediation"".

13As a result of the collision with the snowboarder on 15 July 2007 the appellant suffered a fracture of the proximal shaft of the right humerus. He also ruptured the long head of the right biceps tendon. In or about October 2007 the appellant was found to have an abscess in his cervical spine. It was his case at common law that the abscess in the cervical spine was due to the accident. It was the effects of the abscess which significantly disabled the appellant causing spasticity in his legs and reduced strength in his arms.

14The appellant made a claim under the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (WCA) against the respondent, pursuant to ss 66 and 67 of that Act. That claim was resolved on the basis of a 70 percent whole person impairment (WPI). 

15By letter dated 22 December 2009 the appellant's solicitors sent by way of service, pursuant to s 315 of the WIM Act a proposed statement of claim, a proposed statement of particulars and documents referred to in the proposed statement of particulars. This collection of documents was intended to be the appellant's Pre-Filing Statement. The appellant's solicitors required a response within 28 days in accordance with s 316 WIM Act.

16By letter dated 29 December 2009 the respondent's solicitors replied that the respondent was not prepared to accept, for the purposes of the damages claim, that the degree of permanent impairment resulting from the injury was at least 15 percent. The letter went on to say:

""In view of the above and given that our client has not accepted that the plaintiff has sustained a 15 percent WPI, we consider there to be a dispute (under s 314 of the WIM Act 1998) as to whether the plaintiff's degree of permanent impairment is sufficient for an award of damages.

As resolution of the ""threshold issue"" is a condition precedent for the service of a Pre-Filing Statement, we place you on notice that we consider there to be a defect in the Pre-Filing Statement you have served. This notice is provided to you for the purposes of 317(1) of the 1998 Act.""

17By letter dated 8 January 2010 the appellant's solicitors referred to Operational Instruction 1.24 from WorkCover to the effect that because the appellant's assessment for lump sum compensation had been above the 15 percent WPI, he was not required to undergo another assessment of permanent impairment for the purposes of claiming work injury damages. The respondent's solicitors were requested to reconsider their position.

18By letter dated 15 January 2010 the respondent's solicitors advised that the issue which they were exploring was causation. As a result, they did not require the appellant to undergo another assessment of permanent impairment. 

19By letter dated 9 February 2010, the solicitors for the appellant repeated their position that there was no genuine ""threshold issue"" and enclosed by way of service an Application for Mediation. A sealed copy of an Application for Mediation of Work Injury Damages filed in the Workers Compensation Commission was served on the solicitors for the respondent by letter dated 18 February 2010.

20By letter dated 22 February 2010 the solicitors for the respondent replied as follows:

""We note that on 29 December 2009 we wrote to you to put you on notice that we considered your Pre-Filing Statement defective, on the basis that a threshold issue had emerged. That notice was provided to you for the purposes of s 317(1) of the 1998 Act, and we note you did not respond within the 7 day period prescribed by rule 17.7(1) of the Workers Compensation Commission Rules 2005.

Accordingly by rule 17.7(3) your Pre-Filing Statement is taken not to have been served and your Application for Mediation (of the work injury damages claim) is premature in the circumstances.""

21It would seem that the point taken by the respondent's solicitors had merit because it caused the solicitors for the appellant to start the process again. By letter dated 26 February 2010 the solicitors for the appellant again served a Proposed Statement of Claim, a Proposed Statement of Particulars and documents referred to in the Proposed Statement of Particulars. The letter concluded as follows:

""We place you on notice that if your response to the Pre-Filing Statement is identical in terms to the contents of your letter dated 29 December 2009 we deny that the Pre-Filing Statement is defective and we rely upon the contents of our letters dated 8 January 2010 and 9 February 2010.""

22By letter dated 4 March 2010 the solicitors for the respondent maintained their position that the Pre-Filing Statement was defective for the reasons set out in their letter of 29 December 2009 and requested the solicitors for the appellant to confirm that they had also withdrawn the Application for Mediation.

23By letter dated 10 March 2010 the solicitors for the appellant responded. By reference to Workers Compensation Commission Rule 17.7(1) (WCCR) they denied that the Pre-Filing Statement was defective. They raised the same issues as they had previously and said:

""It is accordingly incorrect for you to state that your client has not been able to accept that the degree of permanent impairment resulting from the injury on 15 July 2007 is at least 15 percent.

It follows that there cannot be a dispute as to whether our client has sustained 15 percent whole person impairment and as to whether our client's degree of permanent impairment is sufficient for an award of damages. ...""

24By letter dated 19 March 2010 the appellant's solicitors wrote:

""We note that a period of 7 days has elapsed since we wrote to you disputing that the Pre-Filing Statement is defective. We have not received notification from you that the defendant no longer alleges that the Pre-Filing Statement is defective. 

We accordingly enclose by way of service a copy of our letter of today's date to the Registrar of the Workers Compensation Commission requesting that the dispute be referred for determination under s 317(2) of the 1998 Act.""

By letter dated 30 March 2010 the solicitors for the appellant wrote:

""We enclose by way of service Application to Cure a Defective Pre-Filing Statement dated 23 March 2010 which we have filed in the Workers Compensation Commission on 23 March 2010.""

25It is not clear what, if anything, happened during the following months. In early June 2010 Mr Medak, the solicitor for the respondent, received instructions to withdraw the objection to the appellant's Pre-Filing Statement. It is, however, clear from Mr Medak's evidence and from the surrounding documents that he continued to have instructions to contest liability. Mr Medak had a conversation with Mr Chipchase, the solicitor for the appellant, on 3 June 2010.

26There was a diary note by Mr Chipchase, dated 3 June 2010, which he interpreted when he gave evidence (Black 28R) as follows:

""3 June, Medak tel"" - meaning he telephoned me - ""you concede threshold - need to file PF defence"" - meaning pre-filing defence - ""contest liability - any settlement offer would be heavily discounted"".""

27On the same day, the following letter was sent by the solicitors for the respondent:

""We refer to your Application to Cure a Defective Pre-Filing Statement dated 23 March 2010. 

Our client is prepared to withdraw the allegation of a defect in the Pre-Filing Statement on the proviso that you consent to the employer serving a Pre-Filing Defence (on all issues) by 30 June 2010.

We look forward to hearing from you.""

28By letter dated 8 June 2010 the solicitors for the appellant replied as follows:
""Thank you for your letter dated 3 June.

We consent to the employer serving a Pre-Filing Defence by 30 June 2010. 

Would you kindly provide us with a copy.""

29In accordance with that correspondence, by letter dated 15 June 2010, the solicitors for the respondent wrote to the Workers Compensation Commission and advised that ""the respondent withdraws its allegation of a defect for the purposes of s 317 of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998"". The solicitors for the respondent served a Pre-Filing Defence by 30 June 2010. This was outside the 42 days prescribed by s 318(1)(c) WIM Act. That period expired on 9 April 2010.

30Thereafter, the appellant's claim for work injury damages was prepared by both sides on the basis that both liability and damages were in issue. On 1 December 2010 the respondent filed its Defence. The matter was fixed for hearing in the District Court with an estimate of 5 days commencing 25 July 2011. It is not clear from the evidence when that hearing date was allocated, but it would have been at least three or four months before the hearing date. 

31By letter dated 22 July 2011 the solicitors for the appellant raised with the solicitors for the respondent paragraph 4 of the Defence which pleaded reliance upon s 151H WCA, i.e. that the injury had not resulted in a degree of permanent impairment for the injured worker that was at least 15 percent. (From the earlier correspondence I infer that in paragraph 4 the respondent was continuing to raise the issue of causation.) In that letter, the solicitors for the appellant submitted that the effect of the withdrawal of the objection to the Pre-Filing Statement precluded the solicitors for the respondent from relying upon s 151H and they invited the respondent's solicitors to withdraw that paragraph of the Defence or they would apply to the court to have it struck out.

32By letter dated 22 July 2011 the solicitors for the respondent replied:

""We maintain the threshold dispute under s 151H of the Workers Compensation Act 1987.

We reject any suggestion that the defendant has waived its entitlement to agitate the threshold issue, nor can we understand why it has only now come to your attention that the defendant intends to resist the claim on that basis.

Bearing in mind that this matter is listed for hearing for 5 days commencing Monday 25 July 2011 your belated notice of surprise may have grave consequences. In this regard you will no doubt be aware that arrangements have been made for the attendance of witnesses (expert and lay) in order to give evidence during the course of the trial.

In the event that you wish to proceed with your proposed application, please ensure we are served with a Notice of Motion and supporting affidavit by no later than 3pm today.""

33By letter dated the same day, the solicitors for the appellant said:

'We enclose by way of service Notice of Motion which will be filed in Court on Monday next. Affidavit in Support of Ian Chipchase will be provided in due course but is based on our letter to you of earlier today.

We will also be relying upon the provisions of s 318(1)(c) of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998.""

34A motion as foreshadowed was duly filed by the solicitors for the appellant. In support of the motion, Mr Chipchase swore an affidavit on 26 July 2011. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of that affidavit were as follows:

""2 In June 2010 I had not turned my mind to the question of the Pre-Filing Defence being out of time. Up until that time, I had been concentrating on the dispute about whether the threshold pursuant to s 151H had been conceded.

3 When I wrote to the defendant's solicitors on 8 June 2010 I was not making any concession about the Pre-Filing Defence being served more than 42 days after the service of the Pre-Filing Statement because the significance of this fact had not occurred to me.""

35There were other matters set out in that affidavit which are not material. 

36Mr Medak, on behalf of the respondent, swore an affidavit in reply on 26 July 2011. In paragraphs 5 and 9 of that affidavit he said:

""5 The 42 day period under s 318(1)(c) of the 1998 Act expired on 9 April 2010. I did not serve a Pre-Filing defence by that time given the effect of Rule 17.7(7) of the former Workers Compensation Commission Rules 2006....""

9 Had I not received the plaintiff's solicitor's letter of 8 June 2010, or had the plaintiff's solicitor objected to the proposal contained in my letter of 3 June 2010, I would have sought a direction from the Registrar deeming service of the Pre-Filing Statement on a date that would have permitted me to serve a Pre-Filing Defence in accordance with s 316 of the 1998 Act.""

37The effect of r 17.7(7), to which Mr Medak referred, was that during the currency of the threshold dispute concerning the Pre-Filing Statement, he could not serve a Pre-Filing Defence. If he did, under the rule, he would have waived any objection to the defects which he alleged in respect of the Pre-Filing Statement. 

38The motion came before his Honour for hearing as a preliminary issue on 25 - 26 July 2011. Each of the deponents was cross-examined. The following evidence from the cross-examination of Mr Chipchase is relevant:

""Q. Did you take that telephone conversation with Mr Medak to indicate that at the very least the question of negligence or liability would be an issue?
A. Yes.

Q. When he was seeking your consent to put the service of a pre-filing defence, did you conclude from that that without your consent he wouldn't be able to serve a valid pre-fling defence?
A. Yes, that's right.

Q. In fact the request for that consent was confirmed by a letter of the same date, 3 June 2010, which in effect confirmed what was said in the telephone message. That is annexure M to your affidavit of yesterday.
A. Yes, that's right."" (Black 28T-29B)

39In the course of submissions before his Honour on 26 July counsel for the respondent agreed not to rely upon paragraph 4 of the defence, i.e. the 
s 151H WCA issue.

His Honour's treatment of the Notice of Motion (Red 64-70)

40His Honour noted that although the defence had been filed on 1 December 2010 no notice of any challenge to it had been provided by the appellant until 22 July 2011. His Honour noted that apart from the issues raised in the motion, the matter was ready to proceed both as to liability and damages.

41His Honour outlined his approach to the motion as follows:

""In any event one must step back and look at all of this and I'm being careful not to make a determination either way when it comes to the substantive merits of this application. The threshold point if I could use that terminology, really is whether this Court should entertain this application for relief at all given the very late filing of the notice of motion."" (Red 66P-T)

42It is clear from what follows that his Honour decided the motion on what he described as ""the threshold issue"". This is despite some remarks in passing that it may well be that the appellant had waived any rights which it had to rely on s 318(1)(c) WIM Act.

43His Honour accepted the assertion by Mr Chipchase that the delay in raising the s 318(1)(c) issue was an oversight on his part. Nevertheless, his Honour did refer in general terms to what he described as a number of concessions by Mr Chipchase in cross-examination (Red 675V).

44His Honour invoked s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (CPA) and referred to the public interest in matters before the courts proceeding in an orderly way. While his Honour was prepared to accept Mr Chipchase's explanation, he left open the question of whether it satisfactorily explained the delay. His Honour took account of the substantial expense which had been incurred in the preparation of the case up to the hearing of the motion before him. He noted that if the motion had been filed earlier, such expense could have been avoided or at least substantially reduced. In those circumstances, his Honour determined that the appellant had not complied with the provisions of s 56 CPA and that the motion had been brought too late. Accordingly, his Honour dismissed the motion.

Submissions on the motion

45The appellant accepted that s 318(1)(c) WIM Act was not a section which operated independently of the actions of the parties. For the section to operate, the point had to be taken by the appellant. In that regard, it operated analogously to a limitation provision (The Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39; 170 CLR 394 at 456 per Dawson J).

46The appellant submitted that the orders sought in the motion were of great importance to him since if the motion had been successful, the matter would have proceeded only on the issue of damages. He submitted that s 56 CPA favoured the success of his motion in that the hearing would have been considerably shortened if damages were the only issue to be decided. He noted that when the case had run, damages were agreed on the second day of the hearing and liability was the only issue in dispute.

47The appellant submitted that the explanation for the delay by Mr Chipchase had been accepted by his Honour. The appellant submitted that this explanation had not been challenged by the respondent. He submitted that the respondent did not assert any prejudice occasioned by the delay in bringing the motion. The appellant submitted that all of the evidence relevant to the motion had been called and had his Honour dealt with the motion on its merits by taking full submissions, the motion could have been quickly dealt with. Accordingly, case management issues did not arise, in particular, considerations relating to the just, quick and cheap resolution of issues before the court did not arise.

48The appellant submitted that although his Honour referred generally to
s 56, he did not indicate how its application led to the conclusion which he reached. In particular his Honour made no reference to ss 57 and 58 CPA which inform the application of s 56. Had he done so, the appellant submitted, it would have been obvious to his Honour that contrary to the conclusion that he reached, ss 56, 57 and 58 required that he hear and determine the motion before him.

49The appellant submitted that the decision in Aon Risk Services Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27; 239 CLR 175 did not assist the respondent. He submitted that apart from the fact that his Honour made no reference to this case, it went no further than to confirm that considerations of case management and delay to other litigants were relevant when deciding whether to allow an amendment to pleadings but that those considerations had to be weighed together with other matters, such as the nature and importance of the amendment to the party applying, the explanation for the delay, the effects of the delay on the other party and prejudice. The appellant submitted that had his Honour taken those matters into account, as he was required to do, he would have heard the motion on its merits.

50By way of anticipation of submissions likely to be put by the respondent, the appellant submitted that the principles of waiver and estoppel would not assist the respondent. There was no evidence that Mr Medak and therefore the respondent, had relied upon any representation by the appellant's solicitors and even if they had, there was no evidence of any detriment suffered. The appellant submitted that for such principles to apply, Mr Medak should have alerted the appellant's solicitors to the fact that he was out of time in relation to the filing of the service of the Pre-Filing Defence. The appellant submitted that the fact that the respondent was out of time had not been induced by him, but was the result of a conscious decision made by the respondent's lawyers. The appellant submitted that there was nothing unconscionable in him taking the s 318(1)(c) point shortly before the commencement of the hearing.

51On the issue of whether the respondent had suffered any detriment as a result of his solicitor's letter of 8 June 2010, the appellant submitted that it would not have been possible for the respondent to have obtained a direction from the Registrar of the Workers Compensation Commission that the Pre-Filing Statement be considered to have been served on a later date because rule 17.7 WCCR was beyond the rule-making power in s 364 WIM Act. The appellant submitted that this meant that the respondent had suffered no detriment by relying upon the letter which could not be adequately satisfied by an award of costs.

Consideration of submissions on motion

52In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to set out s 56 CPA and its cognate sections.

""56 Overriding purpose

(1) The overriding purpose of this Act and of rules of court, in their application to a civil dispute or civil proceedings, is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the dispute or proceedings.

(2) The court must seek to give effect to the overriding purpose when it exercises any power given to it by this Act or by rules of court and when it interprets any provision of this Act or of any such rule.

(3) A party to civil proceedings is under a duty to assist the court to further the overriding purpose and, to that effect, to participate in the processes of the court and to comply with directions and orders of the court.

...""

57 Objects of case management

(1) For the purpose of furthering the overriding purpose referred to in section 56 (1), proceedings in any court are to be managed having regard to the following objects: 

(a) the just determination of the proceedings,

(b) the efficient disposal of the business of the court,

(c) the efficient use of available judicial and administrative resources,

(d) the timely disposal of the proceedings, and all other proceedings in the court, at a cost affordable by the respective parties.

(2) This Act and any rules of court are to be so construed and applied, and the practice and procedure of the courts are to be so regulated, as best to ensure the attainment of the objects referred to in subsection (1). 

58 Court to follow dictates of justice

(1) In deciding:

(a) whether to make any order or direction for the management of proceedings, including:

(i) any order for the amendment of a document, and

(ii) any order granting an adjournment or stay of proceedings, and

(iii) any other order of a procedural nature, and

(iv) any direction under Division 2, and

(b) the terms in which any such order or direction is to be made,

the court must seek to act in accordance with the dictates of justice.

(2) For the purpose of determining what are the dictates of justice in a particular case, the court:

(a) must have regard to the provisions of sections 56 and 57, and

(b) may have regard to the following matters to the extent to which it considers them relevant:

(i) the degree of difficulty or complexity to which the issues in the proceedings give rise,

(ii) the degree of expedition with which the respective parties have approached the proceedings, including the degree to which they have been timely in their interlocutory activities,

(iii) the degree to which any lack of expedition in approaching the proceedings has arisen from circumstances beyond the control of the respective parties,

(iv) the degree to which the respective parties have fulfilled their duties under section 56 (3),

(v) the use that any party has made, or could have made, of any opportunity that has been available to the party in the course of the proceedings, whether under rules of court, the practice of the court or any direction of a procedural nature given in the proceedings,

(vi) the degree of injustice that would be suffered by the respective parties as a consequence of any order or direction,

(vii) such other matters as the court considers relevant in the circumstances of the case.""

53It is clear that his Honour did not decide the merits of the motion, but dealt with it by reference to s 56 CPA and on case management grounds generally. In that regard, his Honour's decision with respect to the motion was discretionary. The grounds upon which such a decision may be challenged are confined to those identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-5. The difficulty for the appellant is that his Honour's decision involved a matter of practice and procedure, an area into which appellate courts have shown a marked reluctance to intervene (Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39; 148 CLR 170 at 177).

54The plurality in Philip Morris quoted with approval the following statement of principle by Sir Frederick Jordan in In Re: the Will of FB Gilbert (dec) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318:

""... I am of the opinion that, ... there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of Judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a judge in chambers to a court of appeal.""

55The challenges made by the appellant to his Honour's decision are as follows:

(i) His Honour should have decided the motion on its merits.
(ii) His Honour wrongly applied s 56 CPA.
(iii) His Honour did not provide adequate reasons for his decision.

56I do not propose to consider the merits of the motion at this stage. That is better done when considering the respondent's Notice of Contention. As a matter of principle, however, I do not accept that his Honour erred in declining to hear the motion on its merits. The courts have always drawn a distinction between the right to raise issues by amendment and deciding the merits of those issues if the amendment is allowed. 

57Implicit in the appellant's submissions is the assumption that had his Honour heard the motion on its merits, the appellant would have been successful and as a result, the hearing time for the trial would have been substantially reduced. That assumption has not been made out. 

58Section 56 CPA with its statement of overriding purpose expresses an obligation and confers a discretion. The overall intention of ss 56-58 is to permit courts to exercise their powers so as to reduce delay and costs, both public and private, in the conduct of proceedings. In order to achieve that, Courts are directed to ""have regard"" to particular matters.

59Apart from the express directions given in ss 56-58, considerable guidance as to how a court should go about its task of implementing those sections, has been provided by the High Court in Aon. In that regard, the High Court had before it the ACT equivalent of ss 56-58. 

60French CJ made the following observations:

""5 In the proper exercise of the primary judge's discretion, the applications for adjournment and amendment were not to be considered solely by reference to whether any prejudice to Aon could be compensated by costs. Both the primary judge and the Court of Appeal should have taken into account that, whatever costs are ordered, there is an irreparable element of unfair prejudice in unnecessarily delaying proceedings. Moreover, the time of the court is a publicly funded resource. Inefficiencies in the use of that resource, arising from the vacation or adjournment of trials, are to be taken into account. So too is the need to maintain public confidence in the judicial system. Given its nature, the circumstances in which it was sought, and the lack of a satisfactory explanation for seeking it, the amendment to ANU's statement of claim should not have been allowed. The discretion of the primary judge miscarried.""

""24 ...The ACT Rules, like their precursors, confer the discretion to give leave to amend and impose the duty to make amendments for the purpose of deciding the real issues in, and avoiding multiplicity of, proceedings. The discretion is exercised in the context of the common law adversarial system as qualified by changing practice. But that is not a system which today permits disregard of undue delay. Undue delay can undermine confidence in the rule of law. To that extent its avoidance, based upon a proper regard for the interests of the parties, transcends those interests. Another factor which relates to the interests of the parties but transcends them is the waste of public resources and the inefficiency occasioned by the need to revisit interlocutory processes, vacate trial dates, or adjourn trials either because of non-compliance with court timetables or, as in this case, because of a late and deliberate tactical change by one party in the direction of its conduct of the litigation. These are matters which, even under the Australian versions of the Judicature Act system, unaffected by the sequelae of the civil procedure reforms of 1998 in the United Kingdom, are to be regarded as both relevant and mandatory considerations in the exercise of the discretion conferred by rules such as r 502.""

""27 ... However, the mischief engendered by unwarranted adjournments and consequent delays in the resolution of civil proceedings goes beyond their particular effects on the court in which those delays occur. In that connection, there have been a number of cases after Sali in which it has been accepted, in the context of Judicature Act Rules, that the public interest in the efficient use of court resources is a relevant consideration in the exercise of discretions to amend or adjourn.""

""30 It might be thought a truism that ""case management principles"" should not supplant the objective of doing justice between the parties according to law. Accepting that proposition, J L Holdings cannot be taken as authority for the view that waste of public resources and undue delay, with the concomitant strain and uncertainty imposed on litigants, should not be taken into account in the exercise of interlocutory discretions of the kind conferred by r 502. Also to be considered is the potential for loss of public confidence in the legal system which arises where a court is seen to accede to applications made without adequate explanation or justification, whether they be for adjournment, for amendments giving rise to adjournment, or for vacation of fixed trial dates resulting in the resetting of interlocutory processes.""

61The reasons of the Chief Justice in Aon were endorsed by the plurality at [116] where Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Keifel and Bell JJ said:

""116 ... There may be some point of distinction in our views as to what J L Holdings holds. We do not understand there to be any difference between us as to the principles which should now be applied in relation to applications for amendment.""

62The plurality also provided guidance as to the application of case management principles.

""93 Rule 21(2)(b) indicates that the rules concerning civil litigation no longer are to be considered as directed only to the resolution of the dispute between the parties to a proceeding. The achievement of a just but timely and cost-effective resolution of a dispute has an effect upon the court and upon other litigants. In Sali v SPC Ltd Toohey and Gaudron JJ explained that case management reflected:

""[t]he view that the conduct of litigation is not merely a matter for the parties but is also one for the court and the need to avoid disruptions in the court's lists with consequent inconvenience to the court and prejudice to the interests of other litigants waiting to be heard ..."".""

""96 An important aspect of the approach taken by the plurality in J L Holdings was that it proceeded upon an assumption that a party should be permitted to amend to raise an arguable issue subject to the payment of costs occasioned by the amendment. So stated it suggests that a party has something approaching a right to an amendment. That is not the case. The ""right"" spoken of in Cropper v Smith needs to be understood in the context of that case and the Rule, which required amendment to permit the determination of a matter already in issue. It is more accurate to say that parties have the right to invoke the jurisdiction and the powers of the court in order to seek a resolution of their dispute. Subject to any rights to amend without leave given to the parties by the rules of court, the question of further amendment of a party's claim is dependent upon the exercise of the court's discretionary power.

97 The objectives of case management are now expressly stated in r 21 of the Court Procedures Rules. It cannot be overlooked that later rules, such as r 21, are likely to have been written with the decision in J L Holdings in mind. The purposes stated in r 21 cannot be ignored. The Court Procedures Rules make plain that the Rules are to be applied having regard to the stated objectives of the timely disposal of the proceedings at an affordable cost. There can be no doubt about the importance of those matters in litigation in the courts of the Australian Capital Territory.

98 Of course, a just resolution of proceedings remains the paramount purpose of r 21; but what is a ""just resolution"" is to be understood in light of the purposes and objectives stated. Speed and efficiency, in the sense of minimum delay and expense, are seen as essential to a just resolution of proceedings. This should not detract from a proper opportunity being given to the parties to plead their case, but it suggests that limits may be placed upon re-pleading, when delay and cost are taken into account. The Rule's reference to the need to minimise costs implies that an order for costs may not always provide sufficient compensation and therefore achieve a just resolution. It cannot therefore be said that a just resolution requires that a party be permitted to raise any arguable case at any point in the proceedings, on payment of costs.""

63His Honour's approach to the motion needs to be considered against that statutory and case law background.

64The subject matter of the motion is somewhat difficult to characterise. It is most analogous to an amendment to a defence where the amendment, if allowed, would have a decisive effect on the litigation. Such applications were considered in Berowra Holdings Pty Ltd v Gordon [2006] HCA 32; 225 CLR 364 and in Verwayen.

65The situation which confronted his Honour was this. A work injury damages claim by an employee against his employer had been listed for hearing before him with an estimate of five days. Liability and damages were in issue. On the morning of the first day of the hearing, i.e. 25 July 2011, his Honour was advised for the first time of the motion. The motion was not ready to proceed on that day and went over to the next day when evidence was taken from the two solicitors and some submissions were made. 

66The appellant submitted that the explanation by his solicitor was not ""challenged"" and was accepted by his Honour. That is not how I read what happened and his Honour's reasons. The appellant's solicitor was cross-examined so that he made the admission at Black 28V to the effect that he realised that without his consent the respondent would not have been able to serve a valid Pre-Filing Defence. It is also clear that the solicitor appreciated that in accordance with his consent, the appellant's claim would go forward with liability and damages in issue. As his Honour appreciated, that admission sat rather uneasily with pars 2 and 3 of the solicitor's affidavit of 26 July 2011 (Blue 168K-O). This was particularly so given the extensive experience which the solicitor had in this area of the law. In the event his Honour accepted that some kind of oversight had occurred on the part of the solicitor.

67Put at its highest, however, the explanation by the appellant's solicitor is that he made a mistake in giving consent to the service of the Pre-Filing Defence out of time because he did not fully appreciate the implications of that consent. Because this explanation was accepted as true, it does not necessarily follow that the explanation was adequate or satisfactory in the sense of explaining the delay in raising the s 318(1)(c) WIM Act point until late on a Friday afternoon when the hearing was to commence on the following Monday. Accordingly, his Honour was entitled to take the unsatisfactory nature of that explanation into account in reaching his decision.

68His Honour was aware of, and referred to the fact, that substantial costs had been incurred in preparing the issue of liability. He noted that all evidence and witnesses were available on that issue so that the hearing was ready to proceed. He was also aware that the first day of the hearing had already been lost because of the motion and that a substantial part of the second day had been taken up with the solicitors giving evidence and with some but not full submissions having been made. No doubt his Honour had in mind that if the merits of the motion were argued, that second day would be lost as well.

69It is true that his Honour did not refer in detail to the provisions of s 57. Nevertheless, the matters which his Honour took into account were the very considerations set out in s 57. Accordingly, I do not regard his Honour's failure to refer in terms to s 57 amounted to error on his part.

70The appellant's submissions assume that after hearing full submissions on the motion, his Honour would have been in a position to hand down judgment so that at the latest, the substantive hearing could have commenced on the Wednesday. There is no basis for that assumption. As the discussion of the matters raised in the Notice of Contention makes clear, the issues raised by the motion were complex. The motion not only potentially raised issues of election, estoppel and waiver but discretionary issues such as were referred to by the High Court in the Berowra Holdings case. The strong likelihood (which his Honour was in the best position to assess) was that he would have to reserve on the motion which would inevitably mean that the hearing dates would have been lost with a commensurate further waste of time and costs.

71Alternatively, if his Honour had been able to deliver judgment on the merits of the motion within a short time, and if the outcome of the motion had been in favour of the appellant, there would almost certainly have been an application for adjournment by the respondent to allow it to seek leave to appeal from his Honour's decision. Such an application for adjournment by the respondent had good prospects of success since his Honour would have been reluctant to allow the matter to proceed as an assessment if there were a prospect of his decision on the motion being overturned and the matter having to proceed later as a hearing both as to liability and damages, i.e. the time spent hearing the damages claim would have been substantially wasted.

72In those circumstances, by reference to the matters in ss 56-58 CPA and the principles explained in Aon, his Honour was entitled to dismiss the motion on the basis which he did.

73The explanation for the delay in bringing the motion was not satisfactory. The hearing of the motion on its merits would have almost certainly led to what was left of the hearing dates being vacated. The motion was not brought with appropriate expedition. That lack of expedition was not due to any circumstance beyond the control of the appellant's solicitors. The respondent had done everything required of it under s 56(3) to prepare the matter for hearing but such was not the case with the appellant. Leaving aside the issue raised by the motion, the matter was ready to proceed to a hearing on the basis upon which it had been prepared over the preceding 12 months. The respondent was entitled to expect that the matter would proceed on the allocated hearing dates and that the costs which it had expended in preparing the case would not be thrown away by the matter not proceeding.

74As explained in Aon, an order for costs in favour of the respondent was not an answer to the appellant's late application. A substantial delay in the hearing of the matter was almost inevitable if the motion proceeded. There would be a waste of court resources if the matter did not proceed. There was a public interest in matters listed before the courts proceeding in an orderly and principled way and in legal costs not being wasted. Delays of this kind adversely affect other litigants waiting to have their cases heard.

75The detriment suffered by the appellant was the possible loss of an opportunity to prevent the respondent contesting liability. Serious as this was, it was a problem of his own making. Had that issue been raised when it should have been, the appellant's position would have been considerably stronger. As it was, the issue had been raised very late as a result of a deliberate tactical change by his legal advisors. In any event, as the plurality made clear in Aon, a ""just resolution"" is to be understood by reference to the overall purpose of sections such as ss 56-58 CPA.

76While it would have been preferable for his Honour to have gone into greater detail in his reasons for refusing to hear the appellant's motion, I am not persuaded that error of the kind set out in House v The King has been established. In that regard, his Honour's exercise of discretion did not miscarry. Even if his Honour's discretion had miscarried, and this Court had to re-exercise the discretion, the above considerations retain their validity and force. Accordingly, I would reach the same conclusion as his Honour and dismiss the appellant's motion.

Notice of Contention

77The respondent's Notice of Contention related to the motion. In it the respondent relied upon a form of waiver or estoppel, as explained by the High Court in Berowra Holdings. That was a case concerning s 151C(1) WCA. The section provided that a worker was not entitled to commence court proceedings for damages against his employer until six months had elapsed since the notice of injury was given to the employer. It was common ground that the worker commenced action in the District Court, without complying with s151C and that the employer did not take any point (in pleadings or otherwise) regarding the failure to comply until the day before the matter was listed for hearing in the District Court, some 18 months later. At that time an offer of compromise had been made by the employer which still had some time to run before it expired. The employer applied to amend its defence to raise s151C and to withdraw its offer of compromise. Before those motions were heard, the worker purported to accept the offer of compromise. 

78Although this argument was raised by the respondent in support of its Notice of Contention, and was argued as indicating a form of waiver or estoppel, the reasons of the High Court make clear that the respondent's submission involves similar discretionary matters as those referred to above when considering ss 56-58 CPA and the decision in Aon. The plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ) said:

""13 There also is a very real difficulty in characterising proceedings as ""invalid"". The institution of an action or other proceeding is the exercise by the litigant of the freedom to invoke the jurisdiction of the judicial arm of government to determine a dispute. That step engages the procedural law appurtenant to the relevant court, which in modern times is found primarily in the Rules.

14 Professor Jolowicz describes procedural law as creating choices or a sequence of choices in the sense that each procedural step taken by a litigant requires the other party or the court to take some action, so affecting the path which the proceedings take towards ultimate disposition This is the case even where a procedural rule is expressed in mandatory form; if the party to whom it is addressed chooses to disregard it, the normal outcome is that a choice accrues to the other party either to do nothing or to seek an appropriate order from the court. 



15 In the adversarial system of justice, choice rests primarily with the parties and it is generally the case that the court's power of decision or order is exercised upon the application of a party. Generally there is in law no restriction upon a person's right to start an action and to carry it to the point at which a choice is cast upon the defendant to make some response in order to avoid judgment in default. Once the procedural law has been engaged, all parties to the litigation are subject to it.""

79Although those observations are couched in terms of the rights of a plaintiff to bring proceedings, they are equally applicable to the right of a defendant to defend proceedings. The choice which was offered to the appellant as plaintiff in these proceedings, was one which is typically to be made by the parties and not by the court, i.e. would he consent to service of a document by a particular date. Such consent was given unconditionally.

80Just as the statement of claim filed contrary to s 151C WCA operated effectually as a statement of claim until dismissed or set aside, the Pre-Filing Defence and ultimately the defence filed in December 2010 operated effectively until it was set aside. The procedural law to which the plurality referred includes not only the offer of compromise, but the law relating to the right to make late amendments, i.e. to rely upon s 318(1)(c) WIM Act.

81The plurality went on to say:

""28 Counsel for the employer expressly eschewed a ""jurisdictional analysis"" of s 151C, and conceded that in terms the section is not addressed as a command to the court but to the litigants. However, the question of statutory construction cannot easily be severed from that of jurisdiction because s 151C concerns the submission of contested rights to a court for curial adjudication in an adversarial system.""

The same considerations apply to the operation of s 318(1)(c) WIM Act. The section refers to service of the defence which is fundamentally a matter between the parties to the litigation.

82Their Honours resolved the issue before them as follows:

""34 The better view is that the provision does not inevitably result in the invalidity of proceedings commenced in contravention of it, either for want of the court's jurisdiction or because the court has no jurisdiction except to accede to a defendant's application (whenever brought) to set aside the proceedings and to do so without regard to the procedural history and the relevant Rules of Court. 


35 The construction advanced by counsel for the worker should be accepted. Section 151C does not extinguish rights or create new rights. Rather, it postpones the remedy for the common law right to initiate proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction. The ""right"" which s 151C does confer is conferred upon the defendant employer and must be raised in accordance with the procedural rules appurtenant to the particular court.""

83The same considerations apply to the ""right"" which was conferred upon the appellant in this case. For the appellant to be able to rely upon it, it had to be raised before the court and then decided in accordance with the procedural rules of that court.

84Their Honours continued:

""36 Proceedings commenced by a worker in contravention of s 151C engage the jurisdiction and procedural rules of the court in question. Such proceedings are vulnerable to an application by the defendant to strike out the initiating process or to move for summary dismissal, but they are not a ""nullity"". Once a plaintiff has commenced proceedings, s 151C must be understood in connection with the procedural structure for the conduct of litigation in that court, not in isolation from it. This is not to subjugate the statute to the Rules, but to recognise that the subject-matter with which the statute deals is ""rights"" in the context of actual or apprehended litigation, and to understand the function of the Rules of Court and procedural law in facilitating adjudication of disputed claims.

37 The upshot is that the effect of non-compliance with s 151C will depend in each case upon the actions of the defendant in the context of the relevant Rules of Court. Where the defendant requires an order by the court for the defendant to give effect to a point as to s 151C, in exercising its discretion the court will take into account numerous factors. Not all of these (as Lord Griffiths recognised in Ketteman v Hansel Properties) may be measured in economic terms.""

85Apart from the case management considerations, which would be a relevant factor and to which reference has been made above, there is also the consideration that not only did the appellant fail to take the s 318(1)(c) point until shortly before the hearing commenced, but through his solicitor he had consented to service of the Pre-Filing Defence, and therefore the actual defence, out of time. As their Honours said:

""39 It is one thing to speak of the waiver of a legal, equitable or statutory right or privilege. However, once it is appreciated that the court has jurisdiction and that its procedural rules have been engaged, concepts such as ""waiver"" (and acquiescence and estoppel) are confusing and imprecise. This was pointed out by Dawson J in Verwayen and Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Roebuck v Mungovin. The conduct of pending proceedings by a party is relevant upon an application by that party for the exercise in its favour of a power of the court. The outcome of such an application depends not upon the exercise of the right of a litigant or upon its denial, but upon the exercise of a discretionary power given to the court. The decision of the court often will depend upon many different factors. ...""

86At [52] the plurality referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal and in particular, the judgment of Mason P (with whom Sheller and Beazley JJA agreed). The plurality characterised the basis for the decision of Mason P as follows:

""It is clear that his Honour took the view that the section 151C point had been raised so late that an award of costs in favour of the worker would not be adequate to prevent injustice to him"".

87What Mason P actually said was:

""60 The offer of compromise made by the defendant on 6 May 2003 represented what it considered at the time to be a fair compromise of the litigation. The Rules gave the plaintiff 28 days within which to consider acceptance, absent an order preventing withdrawal. Nothing happened during the currency of the Offer except the defendant realising the application of s 151C to the particular case and signalling its intention to move the court for leave to withdraw the Offer. At all material times the defence stood unamended, without invocation of s 151C. This is not the sort of new situation considered in any of the earlier cases or within the principles they expound.

61 At best for the defendant, it belatedly realised the possibility of raising a statutory defence that was only a knock out blow if the plaintiff failed ultimately to establish waiver. The point is hardly meritorious when it is recalled that the whole purpose of s 151C is to enable a defendant to consider its settlement options before litigation. The defendant had had well over a year, including the arbitration to assess its prospects. The fact that it made the Offer indicates its ability to do so.

62 The defendant needed to amend to raise the s 151C point. Such leave should be refused (cf Verwayen at 456, 464-5). I would also refuse leave to withdraw the Offer."" (Gordon v Berowra Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 27; 62 NSWLR 427)

88While the plurality doubted that the application of waiver principles provided a proper basis for overturning the decision of the trial judge, they endorsed the basis upon which Mason P had re-exercised the trial judge's discretion.

89The second point made by Mason P also has application to the facts of this case. The point taken by the appellant is hardly meritorious when regard is had to the purpose of s 318 WIM Act and its related sections which is to ensure that complete and full disclosure is made by both sides at an early point in time. By the time the appellant sought to take this point, a mediation had taken place and 12 months had passed during which the matter had been fully prepared by both sides for hearing. Each side was fully aware of the case which he or it had to meet.

90It follows that the decision in Berowra Holdings provides an alternative basis for the endorsement of the approach followed by Robison DCJ in this case. His Honour did no more than apply the procedural rules which were applicable and it was open to him to decide that an award of costs would not be adequate to prevent injustice to the respondent.

91There is another basis upon which the appellant's motion could have been dismissed. The exchange of correspondence between the solicitors by the letters of 3 and 8 June 2010 constituted an agreement that in exchange for the respondent withdrawing its allegation of a defect in the Pre-Filing Statement, the appellant would consent to the respondent serving a Pre-Filing Defence on all issues by 30 June 2010. There was consideration for that agreement. The respondent agreed to withdraw its objection to the Pre-Filing Statement in exchange for which it obtained the appellant's consent to serve the Pre-Filing Defence by 30 June.

92The withdrawal of the objection to the Pre-Filing Statement by the respondent conferred a real benefit on the appellant. The objection previously taken had already caused a delay and the appellant had been forced to start again by re-serving his Pre-Filing Statement in February 2010. The referral to the Registrar to decide whether the objection to the Pre-Filing Statement by the respondent had been properly taken, was going to cause further delay regardless of the outcome. By agreeing to the service of the Pre-Filing Defence by 30 June, the appellant achieved the removal of that source of delay which was potentially substantial and it enabled his claim to proceed.

93In other words, what occurred was a legally enforceable agreement between the parties entered into on their behalf by the solicitors. Such an agreement was not precluded by the terms of s 318(1)(c) WIM Act which required action by the appellant to activate it. Such an agreement went considerably beyond the representation relied on in Verwayen.

94This characterisation was challenged by the appellant on the basis that no agreement took place because the solicitor for the appellant had overlooked the effect of s 318(1)(c) WIM Act. The appellant submitted that, for an enforceable agreement to have been entered into, it was necessary for the solicitor for the respondent to have fully explained to the solicitor for the appellant what were the consequences of him consenting to the service of the Pre-Filing Defence by 30 June.

95There is no substance in that submission. Put at its highest, the solicitor for the appellant may not have appreciated the implications of consenting to the service of the Pre-Filing Defence out of time, but he clearly knew exactly what he was doing. His diary note of 3 June, followed by the respondent's solicitor's letter of 3 June, made it clear that the Pre-Filing Defence which it was intended to serve, raised issues of liability. The terms of the letter of 3 June made it clear that the respondent believed that it needed the consent of the appellant to serve the Pre-Filing Defence by the nominated date. One only seeks consent when it is needed, i.e. when the document sought to be served is out of time. The response in the letter of 10 June was clear and unequivocal. The author of that letter knew that he was granting an extension of time for the service of the Pre-Filing Defence, even if he may not have appreciated the implications of granting that consent.

96In the adversarial system of justice, decisions as to whether or not to accept service and as to how to accept service, rest primarily with the parties. Agreements are made between solicitors as to those matters, as well as other matters of practice and procedure all the time. Without such agreements, the conduct of litigation would be needlessly expensive and in practical terms, almost impossible to manage. There is a public interest in solicitors being held to their agreements in the course of litigation. This is particularly so when the solicitors concerned are experienced and know exactly what they are agreeing to.

97Before this Court, senior counsel for the respondent characterised what happened as follows:

""All that happened here was that one party had accrued to it a procedural point, that is, ""Your pre-filing statement is defective"" and the other party had then various choices. Ultimately that took the parties to a point of decision pursuant to s 317(2) before the Registrar. 

They determined to compromise the procedural disagreement between them, that's a choice they made. Accordingly, they agreed that they wouldn't bother the Registrar to make any determination, they would, as between themselves, determine how the case could go forward and they did so by becoming to an agreement which permitted the defendant, respondent to do that which otherwise it could not do without an order from the Registrar and that concession having been made, that choice having been exercised, the matter went forward right up until the point where my learned friend came into it a day or two beforehand, and to say that this point could be taken because it was a statutory right and of course, with respect, it's nothing of the kind."" (Appeal Transcript 49.35)

98Had Robison DCJ considered the motion on its merits, it could and should have been dismissed on that basis. The appellant should be held to the agreement as to service entered into by his solicitors.

99In its Notice of Contention the respondent raised generally waiver, estoppel and election. It did so in case the Court re-exercised his Honour's discretion if it found that his Honour was in error in refusing to hear the applicant's motion on its merits. In the event, I have decided that his Honour did not err in that respect and that there is no occasion for this Court to re-exercise his Honour's discretion in that regard.

100This creates something of a difficulty in that considerable time was spent arguing this issue and the argument raised important considerations as to the application of WCCR 17.7, which in turn would have a significant effect on the application of ss 313 - 318 WIM Act. In deference to the detailed arguments which were put, I propose to indicate my conclusions on that issue.

101Before doing so, it is necessary to say something about the concepts of waiver, estoppel and election generally. These concepts were considered in considerable detail in Verwayen. For the reasons already indicated, the factual circumstances in Verwayen were similar to, but not identical, to those in this case. In Verwayen the Commonwealth having over a considerable period of time advised the plaintiff that liability would not be in issue and that it would not rely on a limitation defence, raised those issues shortly before the matter came on for hearing. The plurality (Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) were divided in their approach. Deane and Dawson JJ decided in the plaintiff's favour on the basis of estoppel, whereas Toohey and Gaudron JJ decided in his favour on the basis of waiver.

102An important consideration for the plurality in Verwayen was the extent to which the detriment suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the Commonwealth's change of position, could be adequately compensated by costs, or whether he could be otherwise returned to his pre-estoppel position, if the Commonwealth was not held to the position which it had previously adopted.

103Deane and Dawson JJ placed considerable emphasis on the health of the plaintiff and the emotional distress which he would suffer, which was not capable of being compensated by an award of costs. Toohey and Gaudron JJ focused on the change in the relationship between the parties which had been brought about by the position previously adopted by the Commonwealth and how it would be unconscionable for that position to be reversed. Although Toohey and Gaudron JJ did not refer to concepts such as detriment, their description of the change in the relationship between the parties brought about by the conduct of the Commonwealth, implicitly raised that concept.

104What appears to have been fundamental to the decision of the plurality was that there were certain situations where costs were not an adequate remedy. This was so in litigation when one of the parties had not taken a point which was otherwise available to it and had asserted that it would not take that point and the other party had acted in reliance upon that assertion. The application of such an approach is clear when the party disadvantaged by the proposed change of position is an individual. The application is less certain when the party so disadvantaged is a corporate defendant, such as we have here. Can it be said that such a corporate entity through its officers has suffered a similar loss of expectation such as was held to establish estoppel and waiver and Verwayen.

105The issues of waiver and estoppel were not argued in that way before this Court and it would not be appropriate to examine those issues further.

106Similarly, estoppel by convention on the basis of what was said in Grundt and Other Plaintiffs v The Great Boulder Proprietary Gold Mines Limited [1937] HCA 58; 59 CLR 641 at 676-677 and in Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd [1986] HCA 14; 160 CLR 226 at 224 was not raised or argued before the Court. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for the Court to consider that issue.

107In this Court waiver and estoppel were argued in a more restricted way. The respondent submitted that the point which it raised in correspondence with the appellant's solicitors concerning the existence of a threshold dispute about the appellant's Pre-Filing Statement was open to it. It relied upon the decision of this Court in JC Equipment Hire Pty Ltd v The Registrar of the Workers Compensation Commission of NSW [2008] NSWCA 43; 70 NSWLR 704. In that case Tobias JA (with whom Campbell and Bell JJA agreed) held that an assessment of WPI for the award of lump sum compensation under ss 66 and 67 WCA did not preclude an employer requiring that a further assessment of WPI be made for the purposes of determining whether s 151H WCA was satisfied and therefore whether a threshold dispute, as envisaged by s 314(1) WIM Act, existed. As the correspondence revealed, it was the issue of causation which the respondent wished to have assessed.

108I am satisfied that this part of the respondent's submission should be accepted. The point taken by the respondent in correspondence was open to it. It was not answered by the appellant's response that his claims under ss 66 and 67 WCA had been agreed and that he had been paid lump sum compensation on the basis of a 70 percent WPI.

109The next step in the respondent's argument was that the exchange of correspondence between the solicitors, by the letters of 3 and 8 June 2010, constituted an agreement that in exchange for the respondent withdrawing its allegation of a defect in the Pre-Filing Statement, the appellant would consent to the respondent serving a Pre-Filing Defence on all issues by 30 June 2010. The respondent submitted that in entering that agreement, it was suffering a detriment and changing its position in that it was giving up the opportunity of making an application to the Registrar, pursuant to WCCR 17.7(6). Such application would have been for a direction that the Pre-Filing Statement be considered to have been served on ""a subsequent date"" to enable the respondent's Pre-Filing Defence to be served in time.

110The appellant's response was that the respondent had not suffered a detriment in that WCCR 17.7(6) was invalid because it was beyond the rule-making power in s 364 WIM Act.

111In order to understand this argument, it is necessary to set out some further provisions of the WIM Act.

""105 Jurisdiction of Commission and Compensation Court

(1) Subject to this Act, the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters arising under this Act and the 1987 Act.

(4) The Registrar does not constitute, and does not exercise functions as, the Commission (except when acting as an Arbitrator pursuant to the Registrar's power to exercise the functions of an Arbitrator).""

112The appellant developed its submission as follows. The Commission ""subject to this Act"" has jurisdiction ""for the purposes of and in connection with the operation of Part 6 of Chapter 7"" of the WIM Act (s 105). The rule making power in s 364 is restricted to ""any aspect of procedures to be followed in connection with the jurisdiction or functions of the Commission"". While the Registrar is a member of the Commission, s 375(4) makes it clear that the Registrar does not constitute, nor does he or she exercise functions as the Commission. Accordingly, when r 17.7(5) and (6) purport to empower the Registrar to do certain things, those rules are beyond power because the Registrar is not the Commission.

113The appellant submitted that the only power given to the Registrar is that expressly provided by the WIM Act, i.e. s 317(2) - (3). That meant that the Registrar's power is restricted to determining whether a Pre-Filing Statement is defective and to giving directions as to the actions necessary to cure any defect. Specifically, the Registrar does not have power to ""direct that the pre-filing statement be considered to have been served on a subsequent date"".

114The appellant raised a subsidiary point that even if the primary submission was rejected, the Registrar had no power to direct that the Pre-Filing Statement be considered to have been served on a subsequent date since that was not a power covered by s 364. The appellant submitted that 
s 364 only applied to the procedures to be followed in connection with the jurisdiction and functions of the Commission. The question of when a Pre-Filing Statement was served was not part of the procedure to be followed in the Commission.

115That subsidiary point should be rejected. An important part of the power given to the Commission by Part 6 is to determine when a Pre-Filing Statement has been filed. The power given to the Registrar in WCCR 17.7(6) is an inherently procedural one which provides for an extension of time. As such it is clearly picked up by subss 364(1)(g) and (h). 

116The fundamental issue is whether the Registrar is to be regarded as the Commission for the purposes of Part 6 Chapter 7 of the WIM Act so that rules 17.7(5) and (6) are within power. If the Registrar is not to be regarded as the Commission for the purposes of Part 6 of Chapter 7, but simply as a member of the Commission to whom a particular function has been given, his only power is that given by s 317. This would leave a considerable lacuna in how Part 6 is to operate since rules 17.7(5) and 17.7(6) play an important part. Those rules set out the consequences when a Pre-Filing Statement is found to be defective and when a Pre-Filing Statement is found to be not defective after a determination by the Registrar.

117Clearly such a lacuna in the operation of part 6 of Chapter 7 of the WIM Act was not intended by Parliament, but that seems to be the effect of those provisions in the WIM Act which relate to the functions of the Commission and the position of the Registrar. It might have been possible to give to the legislation and the rules a purposive construction if not for s 375(4) which makes it clear that the Registrar does not constitute nor exercise the functions as the Commission. It follows that the appellant's submission must be accepted and that WCCR 17.7(5) and (6) were beyond the rule making power given in s 364. Despite the width of the power given by s 363(1)(j) WIM Act the Court was not referred to any other provision of the WIM Act or of the WCA which would form a basis for the making of those rules.

118That does not end the matter. What the respondent did give up was its right to have the Registrar determine its contention that the Pre-Filing Statement was defective. What the outcome of that application would have been is not known. Clearly the respondent thought that it had a good point on causation, since it raised the s 151H WCA issue in its Defence. It was the respondent's refusal to withdraw that paragraph of its Defence which was the catalyst for the motion which came before his Honour.

119No evidence was before the Court on this issue. Just because the s 151H point was conceded during the course of argument on the motion, does not necessarily mean that it had no substance. That may well have been a tactical concession made in relation to the motion. Similarly, the agreement as to damages which occurred during the course of the hearing is not decisive since this may also have been a tactical decision based on the respondent's assessment of how its case on liability was proceeding.

120It is not useful to pursue that issue further. The question of detriment and/or change of position was not argued on that basis before this Court. The focus of the argument was on whether WCCR 17.7(5) and (6) were beyond power. It is clear that insofar as detriment and change of position is concerned, the argument of the respondent is weakened if those rules were beyond power.

121The appellant's success on the Compensation Court rule issue, does not alter the conclusions previously arrived at in relation to the motion. For the reasons already indicated, his Honour was entitled on case management grounds to refuse to entertain the motion. Had the motion been argued on its merits, it should have been dismissed on the basis set out in Berowra Holdings and on the basis of the agreement between the solicitors. 

The trial on the merits in the District Court
Factual background

122The appellant was born in 1952. Between 1973 and 1980 he was employed as a member of the ski patrol at the Perisher Valley Ski Resort. In about 2002 he commenced employment with the respondent, again at the Perisher Valley Ski Resort. He was employed as a mountain awareness officer in the ski patrol department.

123Perisher Blue Ski Resort is the largest ski resort in the southern hemisphere comprising 48 lifts and about 1,250 hectares. The resort is divided into four distinct areas, Perisher, Smiggins, Blue Cow and Guthega. This incident occurred in the area known as Front Valley on the Perisher part of the resort. Front Valley is the area immediately in front of the Perisher terminal building, located at the base of the range. Front Valley effectively forms a gateway to and from much of the rest of the resort. 

124The appellant was a very experienced skier, having started at five years of age. Between 1980 and 2002 he had skied at all of the Australian ski fields and at ten to fifteen resorts in North America and at ten to fifteen resorts in Europe. He had also skied in Japan, but at only one resort. He was acknowledged to be a very fine skier. His most recent performance report before the accident was very complimentary.

125The appellant described his duties as follows:

""""A. A mountain awareness officer is basically responsible for safety on the mountain and the behaviour of skiers as regards to the alpine responsibility code and the rules of the resort basically. And there's an educational role as well. It involves making children and adults aware basically in an educational manner rather than a policing-type manner of the rules.

Q. Now as part of your duties as a mountain awareness officer, did you have duties in respect of controlling skiers on the slopes?
A. Yes.

Q. And what were those duties?
A. Those duties involved basically two periods of the day that were regarded as - primarily two periods of the day that were regarded as critical to the, you know, to the avoidance of collisions in Front Valley area which is the area bounded by the halfpipe and the slopestyle course in Front Valley at Perisher."" (Black 57K-R).

""A. Generally we had a free rein, except for - you know, there was a sort of a pattern to operations. There was another area over in the - coming back from Blue Cow, where we were sometimes detailed to go. It's another narrow track that people ski fast down. We might be asked to go and stand there round about 3.30 to 4 o'clock, as they come back from there, because that's another area of concentrated people, you know, skiing out of control. But, no, normally we've got a fairly free rein as to where we go and we're encouraged to cover the whole resort during a day if we can."" (Black 89L-O)

""Q. But nevertheless, you yourself ascribe to the view that the role of the mountain awareness officer is best fulfilled by him being able to move around?
A. Yes, and being able to be seen. They can be just as easily seen at the bottom of the mountain and the top of the mountain than standing in the middle of it."" (Black 93T-U)

""Q. Are you saying that you believe that the job of the mountain awareness officer could be done just as well by standing at the bottom of the slope?
A. I do. Absolutely.

Q. But you gave evidence a few minutes ago that you felt that the role was best fulfilled by moving around and being seen?
A. This is a very isolated incident. The idea of slowing people down in Front Valley only takes place for a few, you know, for a couple of hours a day. Moving around the mountain takes place all day. The slowing down of those people in that time is just as effectively done from the bottom of the mountain where you can see and recognise people in brightly coloured different ski clothing. Much more effectively done, I think, from a safe position than standing in the middle of the slope, is my understanding."" (Black 94J-P)


126The appellant described the Front Valley as follows:

""A. Yes, it's the place where everybody accesses the resort, Perisher side of the resort, in the mornings it is the place where everybody funnels into in the afternoons to return to the car park. It's the last lift open every day and the first one open in the mornings."" (Black 58P-Q).

127It was common ground that the slope at Front Valley was relatively gentle. It was utilised for ski classes and for beginner skiers. For persons skiing down the slope there were eight slow signs in position. The slope extended for approximately 500 metres. Exhibit A was a photograph of Front Valley which is consistent with that description. On the afternoon of the accident, there were two mountain awareness officers in position, the appellant approximately midway down the Front Valley slope, and the other officer at the bottom of the slope.

128Included in the appellant's duties was preparing Front Valley from a safety point of view for the public. This included fencing off obstacles and making sure all signage was in place including slow signs. Slow signs were a canvas sign with ""slow"" written vertically supported by two plastic poles, one on either side. There were four to five mountain awareness officers working at the resort in 2007. They worked closely with members of the ski patrol and were under the direction of the ski patrol commander.

129The appellant said that the ski lifts did not open until they were given clearance from the ski patrol, which usually occurred at 8.30am. For the next hour and a half the ski patrol and the mountain awareness officers would engage in what was described as ""speed control"".

130Speed control involved being in the vicinity of a ""slow"" sign and identifying skiers or snowboarders moving on the slopes in a manner that was considered too fast. When such a person was detected, the mountain awareness officer would call to them, or gesticulate, or blow a whistle in order to attract their attention and ask them to slow down. The appellant said:

""A. Yes, if it's serious and it's you know, the guy repeats an offence, it's quite often the case that we follow them to the bottom of the mountain where they're in the queue and available to be talked to and then have a chat to them and you know just - we can either give them a verbal warning or we can call a supervisor for the removal of their pass if they continue to offend"". (Black 60N-O)

131A mountain awareness officer was equipped with a radio, a whistle to attract attention and wore a bright green fluorescent vest or jacket with ""mountain awareness"" clearly written on it. The radio was part of a resort network which placed the mountain awareness officer in contact with other mountain awareness officers, the ski patrol and with an operator at a base station. There were approximately 35 radios in the network. A mountain awareness officer could talk to base or directly to one of the other persons with a radio.

132The mountain awareness officers were seeking to prevent high-speed experienced skiers becoming mixed with beginners.

""Q. Why do you go back on patrol on the Front Valley at the end of the day?
A. Because basically all the other lifts are closed and again we get the fast skiers, all the skiers being funnelled back into the Front Valley area where they finish their day and access the car park. There's no other way to come off the mountain. They must come off through that area to access the bridge across the creek to get to the car park."" (Black 62S-U)

133What the mountain awareness officers were trying to do was to prevent a collision on the slopes. There were two potential hazards - the speed of the fast experienced skier, combined with the unpredictability of the beginner. These apparently created collision situations when those two types of skier or snowboarder came together, which most frequently occurred at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day.

134The appellant gave evidence that the intervention by a mountain awareness officer to make skiers slow down was not always successful. 

""A. A lot of the skiers these days ski with iPods under their helmets. They can't hear you anyways. But, no, very, you know, occasionally, one would glance up and make an effort to slow down to 20 metres and then just continue on down the hill.

....

Q. From time to time, have you ever been involved in another method of getting the skiers to slow down?
A. Yeah. I experimented with a couple of things while I was there that I thought were more efficient, better suited to the job. I found that on other occasions I was asked to go to the top of the lift and assist with crowd control during very busy periods in the ski school. They'd all get off at the top of the lifts and they'd be waiting for their instructors, et cetera; and the area got quite crowded. I'd help to move them out of the way.

I found that if I - in those periods, if those people got off the lift I'd verbalise the fact that this is a slow zone, and for everybody that came off the lift, that they took attention, they saw the green vest, they knew it was the go, and at these times, you know, I had somebody else at the bottom who would then, if they went too fast, can see them and then talk to them behind the crash barrier. So I experimented with it. But I was then asked to stand by the slow signs."" (Black 64B-M)

""Q. What did you notice when you took this other approach of telling people as they came off the chair lift?
A. It seemed to work, but if you had someone at the bottom that could then talk to them, the next time they came down and they were going slowly, maybe they - you know, maybe that first time down they might do it, but then they realised that there was someone at the bottom that was watching them and they skied a little bit more under control, knowing that they were under scrutiny."" (Black 65D-F)

135The accident occurred on Sunday afternoon, 15 July 2007, shortly before 5pm. The appellant had come back from the Blue Cow part of the resort to Front Valley. He described what happened as follows:

""A. My normal knock-off time was 5 o'clock and I decided that I should spend the last 20 minutes doing speed control which is what I normally do at that time of the day."" (Black 67Q)

""A. I went up the lift and took up position on the mountain in the normal position that I would to start doing speed control."" (Black 68F)

""Q. Now, Mr Wilkinson, you've told us you took up position near the slow sign as you've marked off on the photograph, exhibit A?
A. Yes.

Q. Now when you took up position, how were you standing?
A. Sideways to the hill with my skis across the hill, 90 degrees to the fall line which is the line which goes straight down the hill towards the bottom."" (Black 71E-H)

""A. ... I was looking up the hill and I detected a snowboarder above me ... and he came under the rope that marks the side of the slopestyle course, which is a freestyle course on the skier's right at Front Valley.

...

A. And that attracts some attention, the fact that he ran under the rope, which is an illegal thing to do. Then he proceeded to go fast down the mountain and when he got within cooee of me, you know, I called to him to slow down.

...

A. At this stage there was no risk of collision. He was just skiing down a line ... 

...

A. He then lost control and caught an edge or something. I'm not a hundred percent sure what caused it. But he lost control, and turned a sort of sharp left and headed towards me.

...

A. And before I could get out of the way he collided with me.

...

A. His body collided with my body, and his snowboard collected the tips of my skis and just knocked me completely sideways."" (Black 72F-U)

""A. He was falling over. He was in the state of falling over. He's lost control, and he was sort of - he wasn't perfectly upright anymore. His body was leaning to his left and he - at the same time as he struck me just below the - you know, in the chest area there with his shoulder and head or whatever it was that hit me, because I wasn't a hundred percent sure at this stage of the game, I was trying to get out of the way;"" (Black 73D-G)

136In cross-examination the appellant provided a little more detail of what happened:

""A. ... He came down in a line equivalent to the orange vertical lines in the crosshatching. He came down at this angle here, underneath the chairlift, was headed down in that direction when he lost control. So he was coming straight down the hill, not on the angle that the lift is, but more in line with the vertical lines on the crosshatching."" (Black 80H-J)

""Q. How far had he progressed from the rope when you attracted his attention?
A. ... He was probably 10 or 12 metres away from me and at the time I asked him to slow down, headed, you know, straight down the hill."" (Black 80U-W)

""Q. Are you saying that you attracted his attention when he was something in the order of 10 to 12 metres away from you. Is that what ...
A. Yes. Off to the side, your Honour. At this stage of the game he wasn't headed in my direction.

Q. No, no. but you had him under observation for some time?
A. Yeah, prior to that, for 40 or 50 metres and he accelerated to a speed way too fast."" (Black 81H-J)

""Q. When you spoke to this fellow, the snowboarder, did he seem to lose control straightaway? What happened?
A. I'm not sure whether he'd already lost control or whether he'd lost control after I spoke to him. He appeared to be still upright when I said, ""Slow down"", which is the only two words I uttered and, you know, he was going too fast. At this stage, I'd recognised that he was being reckless so he could have already lost control but he certainly wasn't headed in my direction at that stage. I still felt I was in a safe position."" (Black 93K-N)

137In the appellant's case, evidence was given by Ms Armour, an expert in risk management in the workplace. This evidence comprised a report dated 16 July 2009 and oral evidence.

138In her report, Ms Armour was critical of the system of work utilised by the respondent. She said that the work of a mountain awareness officer exposed that person to risk of injury when trying to slow skiers and snowboarders down when there were more appropriate options available. The options identified by her were the use of CCTV cameras, a loudspeaker system, a safe haven and positioning mountain awareness officers at the bottom of the slope to speak to offenders identified earlier by the camera system. She characterised the existing system as setting up mountain awareness officers as ""potential obstacles"". Implicit in her opinion was the proposition that a mountain awareness officer remained stationary next to a ""slow"" sign.

139In para 40 of her report Ms Armour said:

""The method of placing MAOs as stationary obstacles behind signs requiring them to attract the attention of an offender (offending either intentionally or unintentionally) on a slope filled with beginner and experienced skiers, increased the congestion without any indication that the speed risk was able to be actually controlled effectively. There was no evidence available to the author that the risk was managed any better than if the MAOs were situated at the bottom of the slope and simply observed offenders and apprehended them at the bottom of the slope. If the risk assessment indicated that there was a need to apprehend offenders high up the slope, then roaming MAOs could receive instructions via radio to follow and apprehend the offenders based on real time CCTV footage.""

140Ms Armour in her oral evidence, qualified her recommendation for a safe haven as follows:

""I think with my reference to safe haven, the idea was, was that would be used not as an observation point but in conjunction with a CCTV approach where someone would actually alert someone who was situated in a safe haven necessarily located in an existing structure, not something that had to be created on the slope to then go and look at or go and apprehend any offender."" (Black 111I-K)

141In relation to the positioning of mountain awareness officers, the following exchange took place under cross-examination:

""Q. Going back to what I was asking you, is it not better to try and achieve a solution whereby reckless and dangerous behaviour is stopped or curtailed before it reaches an area where greater damage could be occasioned?
A. Certainly, if that can be done safely, not if that's going to be placing the people who are doing that activity or someone else at greater risk.

Q. So one effective way of doing that I would suggest has been established, is that by highly visible officers such as mountain awareness officers, being visible higher up the slopes to be seen by skiers higher up the slopes and the mere fact that they're seen would be expected to curtail behaviour of a significant percentage of reckless skiers, would it not?
A. Well, certainly their presence could act as a deterrent with some, yes."" (Black 113X - 114F)

""Q. ... I think you agree with the proposition that the higher up the slope an intervention occurs, the more effective it's likely to be in terms of slowing people down before they gathered greater speeds and potentially hitting a great number of people further down. Do you agree with that proposition?
A. It can be dependent on the circumstances, but generally for people who are advertently speeding or doing the wrong thing and speeding, the sooner you apprehend them the better as opposed - or the sooner you get your message across to them the better, rather than someone who is just completely out of control at the top of a slope, and they remain completely out of control right to the bottom."" (Black 116G-K)

142In re-examination, another alternative system was suggested to Ms Armour:

""Q. In terms of delivering a warning, would the top of the slope be an optimum place to deliver the warning?
A. In terms of the risk, I think at this time of day certainly, because that's where we've got a lot of people coming down to quickly get back on the lifts to get back into the run. So it would be very important to warn them that they're entering a beginners area, we need you to slow down because we're going to create an increased risk of collision or it's going to create a safety risk. So it would be important to do that at the top areas of the slope.

Q. Bearing that in mind, would as they alight from the chairs be an appropriate place?
A. That could certainly be a place that would capture people that were coming off the chairlift but also others that were coming from further up the slope.

HIS HONOUR: Q: Would that stop someone who was behaving in a hoonish way, someone who would - you've no doubt been made aware of the facts of this case; there doesn't seem to be that much controversy as to what actually happened, would that stop someone such as we have here?
A. I don't think on its own it would, no. It wouldn't on its own, but certainly as one of an armoury, if you like, of control options to try and use, I think it would be appropriate to look at as many as we can that aren't actually going to increase the congestion on the slope itself."" (Black 116L-U)

143Mr Fearnside gave evidence in the respondent's case. At the time when he gave evidence, he was the General Manager of Operations for the entire Perisher resort. Before November 2006 he had been the Slopes and Grooming Manager for the resort. He had worked fulltime for the respondent since 1995 and part-time since 1986. He had performed many jobs at the resort, including that of a mountain awareness officer.

144He said that mountain awareness officers were positioned on the slopes in the slow zones, near the slow signs, so that when they had attracted the attention of a skier or snowboarder, they could point to the slow sign with their stock to indicate a need to reduce speed. He said that communication to skiers was by voice or whistle or by signal. His evidence on this issue was:

""A. Adjacent to the ""Slow sign, so that you can actually point to the person, point to the ""Slow"" sign, use your whistle. And if you're not using the whistle you go, ""Hey, slow down"" and point at the sign."" (Black 130U)

""A. Quite often, if someone doesn't observe what the mountain awareness officer is saying - like ""Slow down, slow down"" - or completely ignores the mountain awareness officer and continues, he can radio to the other mountain awareness officers lower down the slope and say, ""Pull up that person"" and identify the person by their jacket or helmet or ""Pull up the boarder in the red jacket"" or ""Pull up the skier in the blue jacket"" or whatever.

So it's easy to identify the person's jacket and pants and helmet and whether they're on a board or a ski and just transmit that and hold that person until they can catch up with them. Then they would - because people stop at the bottom of the lift. At the bottom of the slope have then go to - gravity has stopped, you know, they're no longer skiing or boarding, so then they go through the chicane, and then they've got to queue up again to get back on the lift to ride back up the hill. So that's a good point to stop and talk to people."" (Black 147J-L)

145Mr Fearnside identified some difficulties associated with using CCTV cameras. They were very sensitive to snowfalls, fog and weather and they had a comparatively short range - 30 metres. While a camera could identify the fact that a skier was moving at excessive speed, it would not be able to identify the specific person unless that person was close to the camera.

146Mr Fearnside said that apart from this incident, he was unaware of any other collision involving a mountain awareness officer. He was aware of instances where other employees had been hit by skiers. These were chair attendants and ski instructors, who were standing stationary with a class. Mr Fearnside stated the obvious proposition that when anyone is on a ski slope, there is a potential for a collision. He thought that such a risk was reduced ""by the high visibility and where they're standing in proximity to a - in a slow zone near a ""Slow"" sign, it's reduced"". (Black 153Q)

147In relation to alternative systems of work, Mr Fearnside gave the following evidence under cross-examination:

""Q. So that if, rather than having a person located I think it's about a third of the way down the slope, as you currently do, if you had a person located at the top of the slope they could just as easily communicate the information down, couldn't they?
A. They could communicate it, but I don't know why you'd have a person at the top."" (Black 160U-V)

""Q. A person standing at the bottom has clear vision across?
A. Yes.

Q. And a person standing at the top, say next to the top of the Village 8, would also have looking down clear vision looking down?
A. Yeah, they'd have clear vision looking down, yes.

Q. Putting aside days in which you have low cloud covering, not on any clear day, you've got pretty good vision from the top. You can see to the bottom and from the bottom you can see to the top, can't you?
A. You can, but whether you can identify - if you're standing at the top of a slope, whether you can actually look down the slope and identify someone halfway down the slope is speeding, and identify their clothing and helmet and pants - I don't think so."" (Black 161G-N)

""Q. As you understand the matter, though, there is in fact no reason why a person at the top - even as you concede they have full view of the field - couldn't just spot from the top, is there?
A. No, I couldn't agree with that. You'll have vision of the slope. But whether you can identify someone downslope that is speeding, accurately, I don't think so, because the people at the top of the lift are unloading. The people coming off the chairlift are unloading, and they're very slow at speed. The access points to the top of the slope of Front Valley are via a run called the Bullwheel Run which is the access point to the top of Front Valley. They're travelling slow when they emerge. Everyone at the top of the hill is either stationary or just moving off slowly. Speed is picked up in the top third of the slope to the bottom of the slope."" (Black 161Q-U)

""Q. Having done that there would be no reason why a person standing at the top, having identified those features of a person, could not communicate with the person at the bottom is there?
A. I don't know that, from where you're suggesting they're standing - that they can identify, clearly identify, a skier midslope, halfway down the slope, to relay that message to the person at the bottom.

Q. You'd be able to identify the clothing, wouldn't you?
A. So long as it's within range. Because what typically happens, if someone is standing lowerslope looking up, they can observe the speed and as the person comes closer to them, within range, they could then do the clear identification. If you're standing at the top of the hill the skier is actually moving away from you in distance and not towards you."" (Black 162I-N)

148In re-examination on the same subject, Mr Fearnside said:

""Q. You said in answer to my friend that you don't know why you'd have a person at the top of the slope; that is, a mountain awareness officer at the top of the slope. Why did you express that view?
A. When people are coming off the chairlift, it's - and you're within sort of that top area that we were talking about within that range of 30 metres of the unload - people are concentrating on getting off the chair, getting their gear organised. You've got a mixture of abilities there. They're concentrating on getting their gear sorted and going forward. And to some guests, if someone comes up to remind that it's a slow zone or whatever, either: (1) they're not going to be concentrating or listening or taking the message in and don't know what benefit it is; and when people come off a chairlift they're not going to be able to identify someone at that point that they're going to be speeding in another two minutes or three minutes. Not everyone on the ski slopes skis out of control of speeds."" (Black 164F-K)

149Mr Johnston, who amongst other things is a biomedical engineer, provided expert evidence on behalf of the respondent. This comprised a report dated 22 April 2010 and oral evidence.

150In his report, Mr Johnston said:

""56 In my opinion an on-snow presence was also required, perhaps not a permanent presence at the lower slope point of Front Valley behind the Slow signs because reasonable vision was available from the base of the slope to the point where the alleged accident occurred. Nevertheless, in my opinion, an on-slope presence was required for areas where reasonable vision was not available and also as part of an overall visible presence to discourage unreasonable behaviour due to a likely presence of being detected and reprimanded. A major part of any enforcement strategy to maintain safe operating conditions is establishing a reasonable likelihood of detection and associated consequences. It was therefore in my opinion essential to have an on-slope presence of mountain awareness officers. With regards to the specific location, it would depend on specific conditions at specific times but it would be reasonable to have a person in the area of the Slow signs from time to time, but I do not agree that a person needed to be placed in this position on a permanent basis ...""

151Mr Johnston did not think pre-recorded messages to slow down over a public address system would be effective. He did not think that they would be cost effective because of their limited range and because of the head dress usually worn with skiing and because the noise of skiing itself would require a high and potentially offensive level of loudness for such messages to be understood.

152In relation to the CCTV camera option, Mr Johnston said:

""60 The final solution was one of video detection. Again this may be suitable in very isolated locations but the identification of individuals with ski clothing and associated headwear and goggles makes it extremely difficult unless constant observation is maintained making the use of cameras impractical for this type of situation. It may be possible to subsequently review footage and identify an individual, but in real time when practical enforcement would need to occur, it would be highly impractical without extensive camera coverage, proactive monitoring points where enforcement messages could be passed onto snow staff for enforcement messages to be conveyed to patrons.""

153In relation to the safe haven option, Mr Johnston pointed out that this would act as an obstruction on the slopes unless it was positioned outside of existing ski lines, which would then significantly reduce the effectiveness of the mountain awareness officer.

154Mr Johnston's conclusion was:

""76 It must be remembered that the operators of the Perisher Blue Resort also had an overall responsibility to reduce the overall likelihood of harm to all participants not just their employees. Therefore, a small degree of risk to an employee which enables a reduction in the overall risk to all persons using the resort would be a reasonable compromise. This would be achieved by keeping the speed and reducing the frequency of dangerous skiers and/or snowboarders. Therefore on-slope deterrence is required to reduce the overall risk to users of the resort.""

155In his oral evidence, the following exchange took place during cross-examination:

""Q. If it so happened that there was a convenient spot on the top of the slope where you had visibility of the entire slope, you've only got to stand there rather than stand down here, there would be no additional cost at all, would there?
A. I was thinking more mid-slope where you've got the speed issue. If you're at the top of the slope I don't think you have the - your ability to judge someone's speed from behind is - it's nowhere near as effective. I was thinking of someone who was mid-slope but out of the way who still had the capacity to do something. But, you know, they are options, undeniable."" (Black 173L-O)

""Q. But at the end you'd agree with this proposition that when you've got a problem in a place, you address solving the problem in that place. And it's not the answer to that question of whether or not you're going to apply it to another place, is it?
A. No, not necessarily. If you're managing a whole resort, and you're looking at speed of skis as an issue, you'd look at it broadly. If it was only suitable in a place you might only use it at a place. But if you're the risk manager for the resort and you're looking at different strategies to control speed and control behaviour, you'd look at it across the resort. There may be slightly different solutions for different locations, I accept that. For example, there are cameras in the station, but that's a different risk, a different purpose.

Q. Can I just take you to paragraph 56 of your report. In that paragraph you express the opinion that snow presence is required. I just want to take you to the fourth line. You said this: Nevertheless, in my opinion, an on-slope presence was required for areas where reasonable vision was not available"". It also was part of an overall visible presence to discourage. Do I understand, from that, that if reasonable vision is available and you otherwise have a visible presence, then it would not be necessary to have that presence on the slope?
A. Potentially, yes.""(Black177H-Q)

RE-EXAMINATION

""Q. Just in relation to your last answer dealing with paragraph 56. your answer was, ""Potentially, it may not be necessary to have an on-snow presence."" Specifically looking at Front Valley and specifically looking at a situation where levels of concentration of skiers can vary during the day, does that have a bearing on your view as to the need for on-snow presence?
A. Yeah, particularly when you get the mix of skiers. During the day, predominantly you've got beginners going up and down there, so an on-snow presence is probably not required. Indeed, you've probably got a lot more risk then, because you've got a lot more beginners falling over. At the end of the day, you get the mix of skiers. You get the skiers coming back in; you get the experienced skiers mixed with the beginners. And that's when you have the potential problem, and that's when they need to be more directly regulated to remove that immediate risk. That's why I say it's not permanent, but it's a horses for courses approach. As I said, it was location. It's all different. It's also time different. Front Valley at the end of the day is different to Front Valley for the middle of the day."" (Black 177G-178B).

Decision of District Court

156His Honour determined the appellant's claim on the basis that breach of duty had not been established. In reaching that conclusion, his Honour accepted that the appellant was a ""truthful and honest witness"".

157As his start point, his Honour found that skiing was a potentially dangerous recreational activity in that it involved speed. There was always a risk of a collision with other skiers or with immovable objects. There was also the unexpected, such as persons described by his Honour as ""hoons"" who did not have regard for authority or rules.

158His Honour noted that the function of a mountain awareness officer was of a quasi-police kind in that he was required to prevent skiers and snowboarders descending too quickly. By doing so, he endeavoured to protect other skiers and to reduce the likelihood of collisions between skiers. His Honour found that this required a mountain awareness officer to be mobile and not remain stationary in a fixed immovable position. Even when located near a slow sign, his Honour found that it was not necessary for a mountain awareness officer to remain stationary.

159His Honour found that because he had a free rein, the appellant was very much in control of what he did and when and where he did it. His only constraints were of a general kind, i.e. the need to be at particular locations at the beginning of the day and at the end of day, such as Front Valley. His Honour also took into account that the appellant was a very experienced skier who must have built up considerable knowledge and experience as a mountain awareness officer over the years.

160In relation to how the accident occurred, his Honour found that the appellant had detected the snowboarder moving at an excessive speed when he was about 50 or 60 metres away and that when he initially called to him, there was no immediate risk of a collision. The collision occurred when the snowboarder appeared to lose control unexpectedly when he was close to the appellant in such a way that the appellant was unable to get out of his way. His Honour accepted that everything must have happened very quickly.

161His Honour considered the alternative systems of work which had been suggested in the trial - close circuit television, a public address system, the use of a safe haven and the positioning of mountain awareness officers, both at the base of the slope and at the top of the slope, but not in between. In relation to a public address system, his Honour noted that if skiers had difficulty in hearing a mountain awareness officer because of wearing helmets or using iPods, they would have the same difficulty in hearing a public address system. His Honour also noted that a public address system would do no more than that which was achieved by the slow signs which were positioned all over the resort and which were highly visible.

162His Honour rejected the assumption implicit in Ms Armour's report that mountain awareness officers were expected to be immobile or immovable when positioned near a slow sign. His Honour found that this did not accord with the evidence, nor did it accord with the ""free rein"" which such persons had as to where they should position themselves and as to how they should perform their jobs.

163His Honour expressed reservations about the effectiveness of a CCTV system and setting up safe havens. His Honour doubted whether the CCTV system would be effective in preventing dangerous conduct on the slopes and for a safe haven to be effective, it might itself become a source of danger by becoming an obstruction on the slopes.

164Apart from the expert evidence, his Honour thought it was a matter of common sense that having a mountain awareness officer on a slope between the top and the bottom would be more effective in slowing people down and in reducing the danger to other users of the particular ski field. His Honour noted that this accorded with the evidence of Mr Fearnside and of Mr Johnston that it was much easier to identify somebody who was moving too quickly from a position midway down the slope, rather than at the top. His Honour also noted that it was not possible at the top to identify which persons were likely to break the rules in relation to speed and that it would be more difficult, if not impossible, to assess the speed of skiers and snowboarders if the mountain awareness officer was positioned at the top of a slope.

165His Honour had regard to the evidence of Mr Johnston as to the value of having a visible deterrence to persons likely to speed on the slopes, rather than at the top or the bottom. He noted Mr Johnston's evidence that such a presence was not only desirable but, from a safety point of view, essential.

166Generally speaking, his Honour reviewed the evidence of the four witnesses and discussed the areas where they joined issue.

167In relation to principle, his Honour noted that an employer was required to act reasonably in devising and implementing a safe system of work with the emphasis on reasonable care being taken to avoid the risk of injury. His Honour noted that liability was not strict. In relation to foreseeability, although his Honour accepted that a collision between two skiers, or a skier and a snowboarder, on the slopes was always foreseeable, he thought that it was significant that there was no evidence of any injury having been suffered by a mountain awareness officer as a result of such a collision until this incident. This was despite the fact that mountain awareness officers had been used at the resort for many years.

168His Honour's conclusions are set out at Red 41 and following. His Honour accepted that the system of placing a mountain awareness officer in a visible location near a slow sign on a slope was one which worked and had stood the test of time without previous accidents. He noted that sometimes accidents could happen for reasons which went beyond the scope of the responsibility of an employer. He accepted the evidence of Mr Johnston of a need for a presence to discourage unreasonable behaviour due to the likely risk of being detected and reprimanded, in other words, an element of deterrence. He concluded that the opinions of Mr Johnston accorded with logic and common sense.

169His Honour accepted that visibility and mobility were part and parcel of the role of a mountain awareness officer. In that regard, it was better for such an officer to deal with things sooner rather than later when dealing with speed. His Honour said:

""Positioning a mountain awareness officer in the location of the plaintiff, although not completely without some risk, I suppose, was in any event an essential part of his role as an officer. It is not the law that every single possibility of an injury to any employee should be completely eliminated. The law does not go that far. One cannot rule out that accidents sometimes can and do happen without the fault of anybody."" (Red 42R-V)

170His Honour noted that there was no evidence of any complaint by the appellant to anyone in authority concerning any element of his employment.

171In reaching his conclusion, his Honour had particular regard to the statement of principle by Windeyer J (with whom McTiernan, Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ agreed) in Vozza v Tooth & Co Ltd [1964] HCA 29; 112 CLR 316 at 319:

""For a plaintiff to succeed it must appear, by direct evidence or by reasonable inference from the evidence, that the defendant unreasonably failed to take measures or adopt means reasonably open to him in all the circumstances, which would have protected the plaintiff from the dangers of his task without unduly impeding its accomplishment.""

172His Honour concluded:

""I am of the view that the defendant effectively did all that it could do given the circumstances of the nature of the employment of this particular employee."" (Red 48P)

Appellant's submissions on liability

173The appeal was in somewhat unusual form. Grounds of Appeal 2 - 6 and 8 - 11 were expressed in terms of his Honour ""failing to properly consider"" particular pieces of evidence. Not only were the findings challenged not identified but the findings contended for, were not identified. A more fundamental difficulty was that neither in the Grounds of Appeal nor in the submissions was there any precise identification of the error by the trial judge. The position was not clarified during the conduct of the appeal which consisted primarily of the Court being taken to pieces of evidence and being invited to use that evidence in a way which was different to how his Honour used it. This made it particularly difficult for the court to carry out the rehearing task which it is obliged by statute to undertake.

174One matter, however, which was clarified in the course of the appeal was what the appellant submitted should have been the response by the respondent to the foreseeable risk of injury. He submitted that a mountain awareness officer should not have been placed on a ski slope, but at the top of the slope where people exited from a chairlift and approached the slope. Another mountain awareness officer should have been placed at the bottom (Appeal transcript 9.15-.32). This was because positioning a mountain awareness officer mid-slope was not only dangerous but it was ineffective. The alternative systems of work raised at trial were expressly eschewed.

175The thrust of the appellant's oral submissions was that the only reliable evidence as to the effectiveness of the existing system of having a mountain awareness officer located midway down the slope near a slow sign came from the appellant. The appellant said that he found this to be ineffective because skiers could not hear him and because they did not pay attention to him. He found it more effective to speak to skiers and snowboarders at the top of the slope as they were getting off the chairlift and commencing their run. It was submitted that the appellant's evidence on this issue should have been preferred by his Honour because he was the only person with actual experience.

176There are a number of difficulties with that proposition. On a factual basis, there was contrary evidence. It came from Mr Johnston and from Mr Fearnside. Mr Fearnside had practical experience as a mountain awareness officer. Both he and Mr Johnston produced cogent reasons why positioning a mountain awareness officer midway down a slope was more effective. An important consideration which they both stressed was the importance of having a mountain awareness officer clearly visible, near a slow sign, to act both as a deterrence to those who would break the rules and as a visible reminder to other skiers and snowboarders that they should slow down.

177Accordingly, on a purely factual basis, it was open to his Honour to accept the evidence of Mr Fearnside and of Mr Johnston that positioning a mountain awareness officer on a slope was more effective than having him at the top or bottom of a slope with no one in between. This is particularly so when that evidence accorded with his Honour's own appreciation of the circumstances surrounding the accident, having heard all the evidence.

178There is another more fundamental conceptual difficulty with the appellant's submission. It moves immediately from the premise of the occurrence of an accident to the concept of how the accident could have been avoided. There is no analysis of the nature of the foreseeable risk of injury and whether a response was required and if so, what kind, of response was required to that foreseeable risk.

179The error in such an approach has been pointed out in a number of decisions. As early as Vozza, Windeyer J said at 318:

""It may seem that, because an accident has happened and a workman has been injured, his employer is liable for damages if it can be shown that by some means the accident might have been avoided. That is not so. The statement that the common law requires that an employer have a safe system of work for his employees means only that he must take reasonable care for their safety. It does not mean that he must safeguard them completely from all perils.""

180In Liftronic Pty Ltd v Unver [2001] HCA 24; 75 ALJR 867 at [25] McHugh J (with whom Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ agreed) said:

""25 His Honour and counsel seem to have proceeded on the erroneous assumption that, if there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to the plaintiff that could have been avoided by using mechanical means, the defendant was necessarily negligent. But the issue in negligence is always whether reasonable care required the elimination of the risk having regard to the consequences of the risk, the probability of its occurrence and the cost, expense and inconvenience of eliminating it."" 

181McHugh J made a similar observation in Tame v NSW [2002] HCA 35; 211 CLR 317 where his Honour said:

""97 But the test of reasonable foreseeability was not always so undemanding. Nor was the content of reasonable care anywhere near as high as it has become in recent years. Until comparatively recently, courts tended to ask whether the defendant had created an unreasonable risk of harm to others that he or she knew or ought to have recognised. A risk was regarded as unreasonable and one to be prevented only if reasonable members of the community would think it sufficiently great to require preventative action. 

...

98 Many of the problems that now beset negligence law and extend the liability of defendants to unreal levels stem from weakening the test of reasonable foreseeability. But courts have exacerbated the impact of this weakening of the foreseeability standard by treating foreseeability and preventability as independent elements. Courts tend to ask whether the risk of damage was reasonably foreseeable and, if so, whether it was reasonably preventable. Breaking breach of duty into elements that are independent of each other has expanded the reach of negligence law.

99 Given the undemanding nature of the current foreseeability standard, an affirmative answer to the question whether damage was reasonably foreseeable is usually a near certainty. And a plaintiff usually has little trouble in showing that the risk was reasonably preventable and receiving an affirmative answer to the second question. This is especially so since Lord Reid said that a reasonable person would only neglect a very small risk of injury if there was ""some valid reason"" for disregarding it, a proposition that effectively puts the onus on the defendant to show why the risk could not have been avoided. Once these two questions are answered favourably to the plaintiff, there is a slide - virtually automatic - into a finding of negligence. Sometimes, courts do not even ask the decisive question in a negligence case: did the defendant's failure to eliminate this risk show a want of reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff? They overlook that it does not follow that the failure to eliminate a risk that was reasonably foreseeable and preventable is not necessarily negligence. As Mason J pointed out in Shirt in a passage that is too often overlooked:

""The perception of the reasonable man's response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant's position.""""

182The failure by the appellant to carry out those fundamental steps as originally stated by Windeyer J and as elaborated by McHugh J led to submissions being made as to the adequacy or otherwise of an alternative system without the essential anterior analysis of whether a response was necessary.

183The obligation of an employer to an employee has been stated on many occasions. Bankstown Foundry Pty Ltd v Braistina [1986] HCA 20; 160 CLR 301 made it clear that a court should not approach the issue of negligence on the part of an employer on the basis of some principle that there was a heavy obligation on the part of the employer to protect the worker. It reiterated that the employer's duty was to take reasonable care for the safety of its employee and that what is reasonable is a question of fact to be judged according to the standards of the time.

184There is nothing in the statement of principle in Czatyrko v Edith Cowan Univeristy [2005] HCA 14; 79 ALJR 839 at [12] upon which the appellant placed such reliance, which is contrary to the statements of principle in Vozza and Braistina. There the court said:

""12 An employer owes a non-delegable duty of care to its employees to take reasonable care to avoid exposing them to unnecessary risks of injury. If there is a real risk of an injury to an employee in the performance of a task in a workplace, the employer must take reasonable care to avoid the risk by devising a method of operation for the performance of the task that eliminates the risk, or by the provision of adequate safeguards. The employer must take into account the possibility of thoughtlessness, or inadvertence, or carelessness, particularly in a case of repetitive work.""

185That was a statement of principle applicable to an industrial accident involving repetitive work to be performed in a diminishing space. While the statement of principle is unexceptionable, it was expressed in the way in which it was, to illustrate the obligation of the employer on the particular facts of that case.

186In this case the employer had dual obligations. It had an obligation to its employees to exercise reasonable care for their safety. It also had an obligation to the users of the ski fields to exercise reasonable care for their safety. As part of that latter obligation, it employed mountain awareness officers, such as the appellant, to work in a mobile and on occasions static capacity to reduce the likelihood of collisions. This was done by endeavouring to reduce the speed at which persons descended the slopes and where such persons were recalcitrant or repeat offenders, sanctions were imposed which included removing the right to ski at the resort.

187The system of work for mountain awareness officers was to employ highly skilled and experienced skiers in the task. Such persons were given a broad discretion as to how and where they were to perform their task. There was a constraint on their initiative in that for an hour or so at the beginning and for approximately the last hour of the day, they were positioned in locations where experienced skiers and beginners, or less experienced skiers, were likely to come together. In the case of the appellant, the location allocated for him was approximately halfway down Front Valley, shown on exhibit A, near a slow sign. He was not required to be immobile or stationary but had to be within the vicinity of the slow sign. Front Valley, as exhibit A makes clear, was a fairly gentle slope designed for use by beginners. The appellant was working with another mountain awareness officer at the bottom of the slope and was equipped with a whistle, a radio and a highly visible fluorescent green top.

188The first question is whether it was reasonably foreseeable that if he were so positioned at Front Valley, there might be a collision between him and another user of the slope? The answer is clearly yes. An affirmative answer to that question would be given if it were addressed with respect to anyone skiing on that slope. The foreseeable risk of injury to the appellant was no greater than that to which any other user of the Front Valley slope for skiing purposes was exposed. The appellant, however, had advantages which a normal skier did not. He was highly visible, he was positioned near a slow sign, he was highly skilled and he was watching for potential sources of danger.

189The next question is that posed in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12; 146 CLR 40 at 47-48. It is the consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability of its occurrence. Given the appellant's experience, the nature of his job, the fact that there had been no previous accidents and his high visibility near a slow sign on a comparatively gentle slope, the degree of probability of a collision was extremely low. The magnitude of the risk, given the nature of the slope, was also low.

190It is true that if the appellant had been positioned at the top of the slope or at the bottom of the slope, the risk would have been even lower, but as the evidence accepted by his Honour made clear, his ability to perform his important job involving the safety of others, would have been significantly reduced.

191Approaching the matter prospectively and not in hindsight, what response to that foreseeable risk of injury was required of a reasonable employer? In my opinion, and clearly in the opinion of the trial judge, no response was required. By using the appellant with his special skills in the way in which it did, the employer was not unreasonably exposing him to a risk of harm. Breach of duty was not established.

192The facts of this case also raised a causation issue. Although his Honour did not direct his attention to that issue, he made factual findings which enable it to be considered. 

193The appellant was not struck by the snowboarder because he was positioned on the Front Valley slope as some kind of immovable target. He had the snowboarder under observation at all times. When he initially called to the snowboarder, there was no risk of a collision. It was only when the snowboarder suddenly lost control and veered towards him that the collision occurred. The accident appears to have occurred as a result of random chance and could have happened to anyone who was skiing on Front Valley at the time. Causation as a result of the system of work was not established.

194With one exception, that is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. But for completeness, I should say something about the particular grounds of appeal which have been pleaded.

Ground of Appeal 1 - His Honour erred when he found mountain awareness officers ought to be able to expect that persons using ski fields comply with the rules of the field such as signs warning skiers and snowboarders to slow down when that was contrary to the evidence.

195This was not a primary finding of his Honour. In any event, it was a finding open to him. It went no further than an assertion that most people tend to obey the rules, a proposition with which there can be no argument.

Ground of Appeal 2 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence of the appellant which he accepted, that the system of work was ineffective in controlling the speed of skiers.

196It is incorrect to say that his Honour accepted that evidence of the appellant. His Honour found the appellant to be honest and truthful. It does not follow that his Honour accepted the appellant's opinion as accurate. This is particularly so when his Honour found to the contrary, i.e. that the system was effective in controlling the speed of skiers for the reasons given by Mr Fearnside and Mr Johnston.

Ground of Appeal 3 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence of Mr Johnston that there was a safe alternative system of work.

197This is an illustration of the conceptual error already referred to. Just because there was an alternative system of work which may not have exposed the appellant to the same risk of injury, is not indicative of negligence. Moreover, the ground does not accurately record the evidence of Mr Johnston. While he conceded the existence of an alternative system, he did not concede that such a system would be as effective as that which the respondent was using.

Ground of Appeal 4 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence that the system of work was for the appellant to stand on the slope.

198This has been dealt with in the primary analysis of breach of duty.

Ground of Appeal 5 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence that Mr Fearnside would not have allowed a mountain awareness officer to perform his work other than in accordance with the usual practice.

199This proposition misstates the evidence. The evidence of Mr Fearnside was that he would not change the existing system of work, unless and until an alternative system was trialled and proven to be superior.

Ground of Appeal 6 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence that there had been collisions with ski instructors.

200His Honour did properly consider this evidence. The evidence was that there had been collisions by skiers with lift attendants and ski instructors teaching classes, because those persons had been stationary. There had been no instance of a collision involving a mountain awareness officer. As his Honour correctly appreciated, the functions of lift attendants and a ski instructor teaching a class were quite different from those of a mountain awareness officer.

Ground of Appeal 8 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider evidence that the respondent knew the system of work involved a risk of injury.

201This has already been dealt with in the analysis of breach of duty.

Ground of Appeal 9 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence that there had been no formal risk assessment.

202During the course of the appeal, the appellant properly conceded that this was not indicative of negligence on the part of the respondent.

Ground of Appeal 10 - His Honour erred when he failed to properly consider the evidence that the alternative system of work described by the appellant as effective had never been trialled.

203This has already been dealt with in the analysis of breach of duty.

Ground of Appeal 11 - His Honour erred when he failed to consider the evidence of Mr Johnston that the system of work should be monitored to see if it is effective.

204The only evidence of Mr Johnston which seems to bear upon this ground of appeal was that any new system should be monitored to see if it was effective. That evidence is irrelevant to any issue raised in the appeal.

Ground of Appeal 12 - His Honour erred when he found the system worked when the only direct evidence was that it did not.

205This has been dealt with in the analysis of breach of duty.

Ground of Appeal 13 - His Honour erred when he considered the provision of a safe haven would have inhibited the appellant from carrying out his duties when there was no evidence to that effect.

206This ground of appeal does not accurately reflect the evidence. Ms Armour, Mr Johnston and Mr Fearnside gave evidence to that effect. 

Ground of Appeal 14 - His Honour erred when he failed to find there had been a failure to devise and implement a safe system of work.

207This has been dealt with in the analysis of breach of duty.

Ground of Appeal 15 - His Honour erred when he found there had been no breach of duty.

208This has been dealt with in the analysis of breach of duty.

Ground of Appeal 7 - His Honour erred when he allowed Mr Fearnside to give evidence about the effectiveness of systems of work when Mr Fearnside was not an expert, the evidence had not been disclosed as required by s 318(1)(d) of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998.

209The first objection taken by counsel for the appellant to the evidence of Mr Fearnside occurred at Black 131F. Objection was taken to the following question:

""Q. It's been suggested that it would be more effective to have mountain awareness officers stationed either just at the bottom of the slope or at the top from the bottom. Do you have any comment to make to that?""

210The appellant took objection, pursuant to s 318(1)(d) WIM Act, on the basis that the evidence should not be admitted unless that evidence was disclosed by the respondent in its Defence, or with the leave of the court. The section went on to provide that the court was not to grant leave unless satisfied:

""a) The material concerned was not reasonably available to
the party when the Pre-Filing Statement or Defence was served; and

(b) The failure to grant leave would substantially prejudice the party's case.""

211In the course of argument, counsel for the appellant also included in his objection a challenge to the expertise of Mr Fearnside to answer the question.

212His Honour dealt with the expertise of Mr Fearnside in a separate judgment. By reference to Mr Fearnside's experience at the resort since 1986 and the various positions which he had held, his Honour was satisfied that he had the necessary expertise to provide an answer to the question. His Honour was of the opinion that the question related not so much to expertise generally, but to a particular knowledge of this resort and how it operated. His Honour noted that the evidence was being adduced to answer evidence of the appellant as to an experiment which he had carried out and as to his preference for a system of work which had a mountain awareness officer located at the top of the slope. This was evidence which had not been included in the appellant's Pre-Filing Statement and had been given for the first time during his evidence-in-chief.

213On that basis, his Honour allowed the question (Red 71-72).

214His Honour dealt with the s 318(1)(d) WIM Act objection in a separate judgment. His Honour overruled that objection on the basis that Mr Fearnside had provided a statement as part of his pre-filing material, which dealt specifically with alternative systems of work insofar as mountain awareness officers were concerned. His Honour was of the opinion that compliance with s 318(1)(d) did not require a verbatim statement of evidence, but rather a disclosure of the nature and substance of the evidence proposed to be given. In that regard, his Honour was of the opinion that there had been sufficient compliance with s 318(1)(d). (Red 73-74)

215As a result of his Honour's ruling, the following question and answer was allowed:

""Q. You have been asked if you cold make a comment or express an opinion as to whether the alternative - that is, to have a mountain awareness officer at the offload point and one other mountain awareness officer at the bottom, with no mountain awareness officer in the middle - you're being asked if you could make a comment about that. So I allow the question.
A. To answer that scenario, no, it would not be as effective as what we currently do."" (Black 141U-W)

216Interestingly, that was the only evidence of that kind which was given in chief. All of the other evidence (and it was substantial) from Mr Fearnside, concerning his opinion as to the disadvantages of the system proposed by the appellant, was given in cross-examination in answer to specific questions put on behalf of the appellant.

217The rulings by his Honour as to the admissibility of the evidence were correct. The experience of Mr Fearnside in relation to the resort was substantial. He was in as good a position as the appellant to express an opinion as to the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative system of work proposed by the appellant for the first time at the hearing. The basis for his opinion was set out in his earlier evidence and in his statement.

218The statement of Mr Fearnside is to be found at Blue 130-138. In it Mr Fearnside analysed in considerable detail the system of work of mountain awareness officers at the resort and expressed an opinion as to the impracticality and disadvantages of the alternative systems of work proposed in Ms Armour's report. This was dealt with at pars 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the statement. The only reason the statement did not address a system which had a mountain awareness officer at the top of the slope and one at the bottom, but no-one in between, was because such an alternative system was not advanced on behalf of the appellant until the trial.

219His Honour's interpretation of s 318(1)(d) was correct. I do not read that section as requiring a verbatim transcript of the evidence which will be given at trial, but rather a disclosure of the nature and substance of the evidence to be given. The statement of Mr Fearnside satisfied that requirement. The statement did not specifically deal with the alternative system of work advanced by the appellant at trial because at the time the statement was served, that was not part of the appellant's case. In that respect, it could fairly be said that this evidence ""was not reasonably available to the party when the pre-filing defence was served"". It was common ground that the evidence was important, otherwise the objection would not have been taken.

220It follows that there was no error in his Honour's approach to the application of s 318(1)(d) WIM Act and that the question was correctly allowed.

221This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Conclusion

222It follows from the above that the appellant's Notice of Motion was properly dismissed by his Honour. His Honour was entitled to do so on case management grounds and by application of ss 56-58 CPA. Had the motion been heard on its merits, it should also have been dismissed. In relation to the substantive appeal, not only has no error been shown in his Honour's approach and conclusion, but the application of principle to the facts found, makes it clear that his Honour's conclusion as to breach of duty was correct.

223The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) The appeal is dismissed.

(2) The appellant is to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal, including any costs incurred by the respondent as a result of the filing of the Summons for Leave to Appeal by the appellant on 27 September 2011.

2759860,Mohamed v R [2012] NSWCCA 173,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 18 July 2012, the Court made orders extending time for the filing of an application for leave to appeal up to and including 26 March 2012 and refusing leave to appeal. These are the reasons for those orders.

2The reasons are to be read against the background of the submissions of the parties, in particular their written submissions.

3The background was summarised accurately in the Crown's submissions, as follows:

""The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of supply prohibited drug (cannabis and 1-benzylpiperazine), possess prohibited weapon (taser), conduct drug premises, ongoing supply of prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) and possession of shortened firearm without authority. There were a number of other matters to be taken into account on four different Form ones.

All the charges other than the ongoing supply of prohibited drug and possession of the shortened firearm arose from a search by police of the applicant's premises on 3 June 2009. The other two charges were committed whilst the offender was on bail for the first set of drug and weapon offences. They related to the offender's involvement in supplying an undercover operative on four occasions with methylamphetamine and police locating a loaded sawn off shotgun when they searched the applicant's premises following his arrest on 12 November 2009.""

4The individual sentences imposed were as follows:






Offence

Maximum Penalty

Sentence


Conduct drug premises

12 months imprisonment and/or fine $5,500

15 years imprisonment and/or fine $220,000

Fixed term of 18 months (11.2.10 - 10.08.11)


Supply prohibited drug (448.2 grams cannabis)

Form 1: Deal with property proceeds of crime ($4320 cash)

Possess prohibited drug (1 gram located in pocket)

Possess prohibited drug (5.4 grams located in bedroom)

10 years imprisonment and/or fine $220,000

Fixed term of 18 months (11.2.10 - 10.08.11)


Possession of prohibited weapon (operating taser stun gun)

Form 1: Possession of prohibited weapon (non-working taser)

14 years imprisonment

Non-parole period 18 months (11.2.11 - 10.8.12)

Balance of 12 months
(11.8.12 - 10.08.13)

(A standard non-parole period of three years applied)


Possession of shortened firearm

Form 1: Possession of unregistered firearm (same shortened firearm) 

Possession of ammunition

10 years imprisonment

Fixed term of two years (11.11.11 - 10.11.13)


Ongoing supply prohibited drug (4 supplies methylamphetamine)

Form 1: Supply 6.8 grams of cannabis

Supply 3.5 grams of cannabis

Deal with property suspected to be proceeds of crime ($1800)

Deal with property suspected to be proceeds of crime ($300)

20 years imprisonment and/or fine $385,000

Non-parole period two years (11.11.12 - 10.11.14)

Balance of two years (11.11.14 - 10.11.16)



5The sentencing judge incorrectly identified the maximum penalty for the cannabis offence (the third offence in the above list) as 15 years imprisonment. That was wrong. It was 10 years. The sentences for it and the second offence were entirely concurrent and no coherent argument that such error was operative was put forward.

6The overall effective sentence was seven years with a non-parole period of five years.

7Our view is that there was no prospect of success of the arguments propounded in furtherance of the essential ground of manifest excess.

8It was first said that the sentence offended the principles of totality and proportionality. We reject this. The structure of the sentence and the remarks on sentence revealed careful regard that was paid to the overlap of the sentences by the sentencing judge. His Honour's remarks on sentence reveal an attendance to the need for proportionality. For instance, the penalty for the first offence of conducting drug premises was effectively reduced from six months to three months by the degree of concurrence fixed. We see no ground for considering that any of the sentences was disproportionate or that the accumulation and consequent totality was in any way unjust.

9It was next said that the sentence imposed did not reflect sufficient parity with the co-offender. The co-offender was the applicant's girlfriend who was earlier sentenced by the same judge. The only real difference in the sentence was that the applicant received an additional six months in relation to the on-going supply offence. There was also a difference in the roles the two played. The sentencing judge expressly directed himself to the question of equivalence of the two groups of sentences. There is no basis whatsoever to argue that there is any ground for a legitimate sense of grievance by reference to the co-offender's sentence.

10It was next asserted that the judge erred by failing to characterise a taser weapon as not being in the lower range of offences under the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW), s 7. The characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is an evaluation of the sentencing judge. In Tran v R [2010] NSWCCA 183, Hislop J referred to a taser (in the circumstances of that case) as significantly below the mid-range. The sentencing judge entirely correctly did not view the factual evaluation in Tran in those circumstances as binding on him. The circumstances here, in particular having such a weapon in connection with a drug supply business, no doubt affected the evaluation. In any event the sentence for the offence was one that was significantly below the standard non-parole period. There are no reasonable prospects of success of demonstrating error in this regard.

11It was also submitted that the sentence for the loaded shotgun was excessive. We reject that as lacking merit. Given the concurrency with the taser offence and the ongoing supply, very little of this sentence was not concurrent. Again, in the context of the conduct of a drug supply business the offence was a serious one and the sentence plainly just and proportionate.

12The sentence overall was clearly within the appropriate range. 

13There are no reasonable prospects of success on any of the grounds put forward.

		16 August 2012",2012-08-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759862,Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Price J. I have no hesitation in agreeing with his Honour in relation to grounds 2, 3 and 4. My concern lies with ground 1.

2The decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 made clear that the decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 was wrongly decided. That does not mean that all sentences passed before Muldrock relying on Way are necessarily vitiated by operative error. No such mechanical submission was made by Mr Dhanji SC, who appeared for the applicant. Nevertheless, a judge who has so scrupulously and carefully followed the precedents binding on her (as this judge did, if I may respectfully say so) can be taken to approach the matter accordingly. 

3Here at [74] of her reasons, the sentencing judge referred to ""the principles discussed in"" not only Way but a number of decisions of this Court, including R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110. In that decision, Simpson J (with whom Grove J and R A Hulme J agreed) in expounding those principles said at [90]-[91]:

""[90] It is because the standard non-parole period is to be treated as 'a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guide post' (Way, [122]) that this Court has required some specification of where in the range of objective seriousness an offence lies. Leaving aside other relevant factors, such as personal circumstances, one would expect an offence classified as substantially below the mid-range of objective seriousness to incur a sentence substantially below the standard non-parole period; an offence slightly below mid-range of objective seriousness to incur a sentence slightly below the standard non-parole period; and the converse where the offence is slightly, significantly, or substantially above the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

[91] In fact, taking the approach proposed by Howie J provides some check against error. If an intended sentence has a non-parole period substantially below the standard non-parole period, but the offence is held to be slightly below the mid-range of objective seriousness, then a sentencing judge would be wise to examine whether other factors (for example, personal circumstances) warranted that differential. If they do not, the sentence should be re-considered: see Way, [124].""

4To approach the matter thus may be seen to involve a degree of tethering to the standard non-parole period requiring justification for movement away from the ""reference point"", or ""benchmark"", or ""guidepost"": cf R v El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111; 267 ALR 734 at [70] ff. Reference points, benchmarks or guideposts imply a degree of precision to a process which necessarily lacks such precision. Metaphors are apt to conceal as much as illuminate. Here the sentencing judge in her otherwise careful and precise remarks can be taken to be following perspicaciously the approach then required by this Court. That said, as the reasons of Price J reveal, her Honour dealt with all the circumstances attending the sentencing process in a way which in form and expression might not reflect error even after Muldrock. The assessment of the approach taken, however, is not a formal one, rather it is substantive. At [78], her Honour spoke of the offence as ""just above the mid-range"". This appears to involve a degree of precision that might be seen as chimeric, though faithful to such cases as McEvoy and R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338. The expression of reasons should be assessed by a fair reading of them in the context of the then perceived orthodoxy of approach, as McCallum J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) said in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 at [35]-[36]. Here the non-parole period, taking into account the 25 per cent utilitarian discount applied, was a little above 21 years (what might be seen to be ""just above"" the standard non-parole period).

5It is unnecessary for me to reach a final view about the approach employed by her Honour. This is so because, like Price J, I am unpersuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). The facts have been set out fully in Price J's reasons. I will not dwell on them to an extent beyond that which is necessary. The applicant strangled and bludgeoned the young woman with a shovel in a brutal attack that killed her from the blunt force injury inflicted and asphyxiation. Though not planned, the murder was intended and brutal. The sentence in all the circumstances was not only not excessive (ground 4), but it was justly reflective of all the favourable circumstances and considerations put on behalf of the applicant. I am unpersuaded that a less severe sentence is warranted in law. Indeed, I am of the view that the sentence was both just and proportionate.

6Thus, even if her Honour committed an error in the application of principles in Way, the orders proposed by Price J should be made.

7PRICE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the charge of having murdered Shana Joy Wilkinson on or about 18 September 2009 and adhered to his plea in the Supreme Court. The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years has been prescribed. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, 3 months and 23 days commencing on 24 September 2009 and expiring on 15 January 2026 with a balance of term of 5 years, 5 months and 8 days commencing on 16 January 2026 and expiring on 23 June 2031. The earliest date that he will be eligible for release on parole is 16 January 2026. 

8The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence upon the following grounds: 

1. The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which she had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offence. 

2.The learned sentencing judge erred in giving weight to the applicant's prior use of illicit drugs thereby reducing the extent to which her Honour had regard to the applicant's prior good character. 

3.The learned sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the applicant's youth, together with the inevitable length of his incarceration, and his good character when assessing his prospects of rehabilitation. 

4.The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

Facts 

The facts were put before the sentencing judge by way of an agreed statement, which the sentencing judge detailed in her remarks on sentence. The following convenient summary of the agreed facts is taken from the Crown's written submissions: 

The deceased was reported missing on 20 September 2009. Her mother had last seen her at home at 9.30pm on 18 September 2009 and had made several unsuccessful attempts to contact her on her mobile phone. Her mother contacted several friends of the deceased including the applicant. The applicant told her that he had picked the deceased up at home at around 11pm on the Friday night and dropped her off near Edward and Federation Drive. The applicant was the last person to see the deceased.

On Monday 21 September 2009 and the following day the Police, the SES and the Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA) conducted searches for the deceased. The applicant attended VRA headquarters on 22 September 2009 and assisted with the search of the Murray River and its banks. As part of the investigation Police interviewed friends of the deceased including the applicant who participated in an ERISP. He told Police that the deceased sent him a text message on Friday night and later rang him. She sounded upset so he went to see her and noticed that she had been drinking. He took her for a drive and she indicated that she wanted to rekindle their relationship but he declined as he had moved on with a new girlfriend. The applicant stopped the car at her request as she stated she was going to see a friend. This was at about 11pm.

Despite extensive searches of the Murray River the deceased could not be located. Telephone records confirmed the applicant was the last person to have telephone contact with the deceased.

On 24 September 2009 at 2pm Police spoke to the applicant in the presence of his father Graham Williams. During this conversation the applicant told Police ""..its looks pretty bad for me. I was the last one to see her alive and they haven't found her body "". He then corrected himself and stated ""No I mean they haven't found Shana. I've been out with VRA looking for her"". The applicant's vehicle, a white Ford Falcon was seized by Police. The applicant's father advised Police that they had seized the wrong vehicle as the applicant was driving his other vehicle, a silver Ford Falcon ute on the Friday night. The applicant confirmed this and gave permission for Police to seize the ute for examination.

Police asked the applicant to recall what had happened after he dropped the deceased off. The applicant asked to speak to his father. Following this conversation, the applicant again told Police that he had dropped the deceased off in Edward Street, went home and had a shower after which he drove to his girlfriend's house. He agreed to give Police the clothes he had been wearing on Friday night. Shortly after, the applicant's father, Mr Williams said ""He strangled her"". The applicant said ""/ killed her"". He told Police that he had buried the deceased near the Lagoon and agreed to show them the burial site. He was arrested and cautioned.

The applicant directed police to an area known as ""Dairy Lagoon"" not far from the waters edge. He said to police ""/ didn't mean to do it. It started out as a joke but I couldn't stop squeezing"". He demonstrated how he strangled her in a headlock type position from behind. He said he hit her with a shovel, took her clothes off and buried her. He said she was dead before he hit her with the shovel. He told Police he put his clothes and her clothes in a bag and put them in the roof of his house. The applicant declined to answer any questions after obtaining legal advice and was charged.

The body of the deceased was located approximately 600 millimetres below the surface at the burial site. The body was naked and face down. An autopsy report revealed that the cause of death was blunt force injuries to the head. Asphyxia was found to be a significant contributing factor to the death. The following injuries to the head were noted;

·Large lacerations lateral to the right eye, scalp of the 
forehead and back of skull.
·Commuted fractures of the base of the skull.
·Fractures of the right frontal skull left occipital skull and right orbit.
·The brain had small subarachnoid and subdural 
haemorrhages and contusions.

4.The following asphyxial injuries were noted:
·Transverse bar like area of blanching of the anterior neck with adjacent profuse petechial haemorrhage.
·Contusions on the skin of the front of the neck and the central posterior neck and the left posterior shoulder and right anterior shoulder.
·Subconjunctival haemorrhages, petechial haemorrhages of the oral mucosa and deep soft tissue haemorrhages within the neck.


A black plastic bag containing the applicant's and deceased's clothing was located in the roof cavity of the applicant's house. A fingerprint and a palm print of the applicant were located on the exterior of the plastic garbage bag. The applicant's jeans were forensically examined and it was found that the deceased had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from several areas on the jeans. Semen was not detected on the rectal, nasal, oral or vaginal swab of the deceased.

The autopsy report revealed no detectable alcohol or common drugs of abuse or prescribed drugs in the deceased's body.

9The offender had given an account of events before the murder that was recorded by Dr Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist in a report dated 4 January 2011. The sentencing judge said (ROS at [8]-[9]): 

""In evidence was a report prepared by the forensic psychiatrist Dr Westmore, who examined the offender on 23 December 2010. The account which Dr Westmore recorded the offender had given him was: 

""I asked him what happened on the night of the incident. He said it was about one week after his current girlfriend had a miscarriage. He said ""I'd been drinking pretty heavily all week and that night I really wrote meself off. She (Shana) rang me asking if I wanted to go for a drink. I went and picked her up (from her home). We were driving around for a bit and pulled over at the river, just talking. I told her how devastated I was at losing the baby. I was ready to be a father, built meself up to it. She said it was a good thing that it died, that it was a good thing that happened. That is when I got angry. I never really get angry like that, something was saying, I don't know how to explain it, something in me snapped I guess."" 

He continued and stated ""It shouldn't have happened in the first place. I realised what I'd done. I freaked out and I panicked and that is when I tried to get rid of her."" 

I told him the police indicate that he had said at some stage that he had strangled Shana and he said ""Yes, that is correct."" I told him I understood he had also stated at some stage that he had hit her with a shovel, he said yes. I enquired had there been any sexual intimacy between him and Shana on that particular night, he said no. 

I told him I understood she had been stripped naked and he said ""Correct."" I asked him why he done that and he said ""Panic I just wanted it all to go away, I was freaking out about going to gaol. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't believe I'd done something like that."" 

I asked him how much alcohol he had consumed on the night and he said he had consumed a large bottle of Jack Daniel, twelve schooners and he had smoked cannabis as well. I confirmed with him that he had consumed a whole bottle of spirits by himself and he said yes to that question. He then said ""I've been an alcoholic for years."" I enquired had he been heavily intoxicated on the night and he said ""Yes, I started drinking at quarter past three when I knocked off work. "" He said the incident occurred between 10.30pm and 11.00pm. He thought Shana had been drinking as well, he said he can remember that she had a bottle of wine with her. 

He had smoked a $20 packet of cannabis over a period of time leading up to the homicide."" 

Later Dr Westmore noted: 

""I took him back to the offending behaviour and asked him what was he thinking at the time. He said ""Something was telling me, you can't let her talk like that, it wasn't the first baby that I'd lost. I was pretty built up to be a father. When she said she was glad it died, it wasn't even like anger, it was blind rage. I've never felt anything like it before."" 

I asked him did he think he had lost control on that particular night or not. He said ""Yeah, I think I did."" I enquired did he think that he would have lost control in the same way if he had not used drugs and alcohol that night. He said no. I asked him in the past when he had been aggressive, had it always been in conjunction with drug and alcohol use, he said yes."" 

Personal circumstances 

10The applicant did not give evidence before the sentencing judge, but Anne McGeeham, his mother did. Ms McGeeham agreed with the applicant's family background that had been detailed in Dr Westmore's report. The applicant was 22 years old at the time of the murder and 23 years old when sentenced. He is the second child in a family of three children and was raised in Corowa. His father was employed as a meat inspector at the abbatoirs and his mother as a high school teacher. They separated when the applicant was approximately 9 years old. He left school in year 11 to commence a 3 year apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. The applicant received an award from the Australian Industry Group (his sponsor) as the best 3rd year apprentice in the engineering-mechanical trade and was subsequently named Victorian apprentice of the year in 2008. Upon completing his apprenticeship, he continued his employment with Goodman Fielder, with whom he had been apprenticed, until he undertook contracting work for the same company. He purchased a home and his activities included volunteer work in search and rescue operations. 

11The written material that was placed before the sentencing judge included the nomination form for the Victorian apprentice of the year award, a ""custodial employment"" history and statements of attainment. 

12The applicant did not have a record of previous criminal convictions. 

13Dr Westmore reported that the applicant had started drinking at the age of 13, mainly on the weekends but in a ""binge pattern"". At the age of 17, he was consuming a six-pack of beer most nights or alternatively he would drink whiskey and port. There was additional binging on top of that more regular pattern of alcohol consumption. The applicant started smoking cannabis at the age of 13 and by 18, he was taking ecstasy and amphetamines. He would use illicit drugs most weekends. 

14Dr Westmore diagnosed probable post-traumatic stress disorder secondary to the homicide, alcohol abuse and substance abuse. 

15Dr Westmore considered that based on the applicant's ""longitudinal history"", the extreme nature of the violence towards the deceased did seem to be unexpected and unpredictable. He opined that ""feelings of depression and despondency following Emily's pregnancy problems and [the applicant's] abuse of drugs and alcohol on the night in question are all likely to have been significant contributors to the offending behaviour."" The psychiatrist opined that the applicant's ""general risk to the community is probably low, particularly if he is able to enter into sobriety in relation to drug and alcohol use."" 

16A report dated 16 February 2011 from Dr Susan Pulman, a psychologist, was also before the sentencing judge. Dr Pulman reported the applicant's description of having gone on a ""daily binge"" from the age of 17, often resulting in black outs and his use of ecstasy and amphetamines a ""fair bit on weekends"" from the age of 18. The applicant told Dr Pulman that he had attended an Alcoholics Anonmymous meeting and went through a detoxification on his own. 

17Results of a neuropsychological assessment indicated that the applicant was functioning within the average range of intellectual ability. He had sound abilities in problem solving, judgement and self-regulation. 

18Ms McGeeham gave evidence that she knew that the applicant went out with his friend's drinking, but she did not know that he had been consuming the level of alcohol reported to Dr Westmore. She knew about the cannabis, but did not realise how much cannabis he was consuming nor about other drugs. She agreed that the applicant had been able to maintain full-time employment and had not taken time off work. She first learnt of Emily's pregnancy and miscarriage from Emily after her son's arrest. Ms McGeeham said that Emily could possibly have been carrying twins that she thought was personal to the applicant as she and her father were twins and the applicant had previously lost a child.

Some findings by the sentencing judge 

19It is convenient to mention some of the findings about which there is no complaint upon appeal. The sentencing judge found:

·The offence was not planned.

·The applicant had an intention to kill 

·On confession, the applicant co-operated with police and had provided certain assistance to them. 

·The applicant was entitled to a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian discount for his guilty plea. 

·The applicant was remorseful. 

20The sentencing judge was not persuaded that provocation, as the result of a combination of the applicant's increased sensitivity to the deceased's remarks and the effects of alcohol and cannabis on his judgement had been established. The sentencing judge referred to the ""two quite different accounts"" of how the applicant came to murder the deceased. Her Honour observed at (ROS [66]) that ""it was only when he spoke to Dr Westmore, that he gave any account of remarks made by Ms Wilkinson, which provoked his 'blind rage', causing him to strangle her. His earlier account was that the strangling began as a joke. Because [the applicant] gave no evidence, his differing accounts were not tested."" 

21Her Honour was not of the view that special circumstances should be found. 

Ground 1:The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which 
she had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offence. 

22The sentence was imposed prior to the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. Mr Dhanji SC for the applicant, submitted that the sentencing judge's approach in following the decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 was unimpeachable, but the High Court in Muldrock held that Way was wrongly decided. 

23Mr Dhanji submitted that her Honour had engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing the applicant that was not permitted. 

24Attention was drawn by senior counsel to the sentencing judge's remarks at (ROS [73] - [74]): 

""As I have said, the offence of murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, attracts the operation of s 54A of the Act, which provides for a standard non-parole period of 20 years for a mid-range offence of murder. This standard non-parole period does not apply after a plea, but it must still be kept in mind as 'a reference point, or benchmark' in sentencing, as must the maximum penalty (see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [122]). 

In considering where in the range this offence falls, I have paid regard to the principles discussed in R v Way ; R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575; MLP v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93; R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110; Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282; and R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43. For the offender it was urged that particular regard would be paid to what Kirby J observed in MLP v The Queen at [33]."" 

and at [78] - [79]: 

""Having weighed the various aggravating and mitigating matters which must be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, I am satisfied that the evidence does not permit a conclusion that this offence fell below the mid-range of seriousness, even though it was not premeditated. I have concluded that this offence falls at just above the mid-range of such offences. 

In determining sentence, consideration must be given to that conclusion, as well as to the offender's subjective case and the mitigating matters which are relevant to sentence. They include my conclusion that the offender is entitled to a 25% utilitarian discount; his remorse and prospects of rehabilitation; and his confession and co-operation with the authorities."" 

25When invited to specifically identify the error, Mr Dhanji said that having made a finding of the objective gravity of the offence, the sentencing judge came up with some form of figure and then moved away from that figure as a result of other factors as if s 54B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was to be applied in ""a mechanistic way"". Reliance was also placed upon the argument that the sentencing judge had given more emphasis to the standard non-parole period than was warranted. 

26Senior counsel for the applicant pointed to the 29 year undiscounted starting point of the sentence that corresponded to a non-parole period (absent special circumstances) of 21 years, which was ""slightly above the standard non-parole period:"" The non-parole period set by the sentencing judge appeared to correspond with her assessment of the offence as ""just above the mid range"", but this approach had led to a discounting of the applicant's strong subjective case with the distortion of the ultimate result. Another complaint was that her Honour's view as to the objective gravity of the offence appears to have been influenced by the rejection of provocation, which was no longer permissible after Muldrock. 

27The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge did not adopt an approach of commencing with the standard non-parole period and then seeking to find factors which could justify a variation from it. The Crown contended that her Honour had clearly outlined factors relevant to the objective facts and the applicant's subjective case before arriving at sentence. There was nothing in the sentencing remarks that suggested a two-stage approach nor had the sentence been impermissibly inflated because of over emphasis upon the standard non-parole period. The Crown cited Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26] where Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) stated: 

""In my opinion no error has been shown in relation to the way the Sentencing Judge approached the standard non-parole period. Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre- Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick."" 

28In the present case, the applicant had pleaded guilty and the sentencing judge noted at (ROS [73]) that the standard non-parole period did not apply, ""but it must still be kept in mind as 'a reference point, or benchmark'."" Mr Dhanji, however, referred to Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50. In that appeal, the offender had pleaded guilty and the judge had remarked that the standard non-parole period was ""a guideline only, as there was a plea"". McCallum J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed), after noting the Crown's reliance on Butler said at [35] - [36]: 

""However, in my view, a fair reading of the remarks on sentence as a whole, knowing they were made before Muldrock was decided, reveals that the Judge did in effect adopt a two-staged process of reasoning, beginning with his assessment that the offence was placed just below the mid range of objective seriousness for that type of offence. I think it is highly likely that, informed by that assessment, his Honour used the standard non-parole period as the springboard from which he delved into the task of balancing the other factors identified.

My conclusion on that issue is reinforced by the neatness of the mathematics involved. As already noted, before applying the discount of twenty-five percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea, the Judge must have started with a head sentence of six years and eight months. The structure of that sentence in accordance with the statutory ratio would have been a non-parole period of exactly five years with a balance of term of twenty months. The non-parole period of three years and six months ultimately imposed can be reconciled by the application of the discount for the plea and a small adjustment to the statutory ratio to reflect the finding of special circumstances. The figure thus reached neatly reflected his Honour's assessment that the offence was placed just below the mid range.""

29It is necessary to consider all of the sentencing judge's remarks to determine whether there is error of the kind identified in Muldrock. 

30In concluding that Way had been wrongly decided, the High Court held at [25] that it was an error to characterise s 54B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in mandatory terms. Section 54B(2) provides that when determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. The High Court held at [26] - [27] that the correct approach was to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentence (including the maximum sentence and standard non-parole period, which are two legislative guideposts of which the court is mindful) and then make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending and without reference to matters personal to an offender. A two stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1 offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle of the hypothetical range of objective seriousness, and if it did, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period, was rejected by the High Court at [28]. The requirement under s 54B to identify the facts, matters and circumstances by which the non-parole period imposed varied from the standard non-parole period, did not oblige the attribution of mathematical values to matters of significance, nor the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending: Muldrock at [29]. 

31An analysis of the sentencing judge's very careful remarks reveals that her Honour referred at (ROS [2]) to the maximum penalty and prescribed non-parole period, then detailed at (ROS [4] - [26]) the agreed facts and the evidence, then moved to the respective cases that had been advanced by the parties and to the court's sentencing task at (ROS [27] - [31]). Her Honour then discussed the aggravating factors at (ROS [33] - [35]) and the factors of mitigation at (ROS [36] - [72]). Her Honour acknowledged at (ROS [73]) that the standard non-parole period did not apply but was to be kept in mind as 'a reference point, or benchmark' and at (ROS [74]) that she had paid regard to the principles discussed in Way and the other authorities cited, in considering where in the range of seriousness the offence fell. Having weighed the various aggravating and mitigating factors to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour concluded at (ROS [78]) that the offence fell ""at just above the mid-range of such offences"". In determining the sentence, her Honour gave consideration at (ROS [79]) to the applicant's subjective case and mitigating matters and the utilitarian discount for the plea. Her Honour said at (ROS [90]) that a head sentence of 29 years was appropriate, but for the plea. 

32I do not think that a fair analysis of the sentencing remarks discloses the adoption of a two-stage approach. The sentencing judge did not commence with an assessment of whether the offence fell within the middle range of objective seriousness and then point to factors that justified a longer or shorter non-parole period than had been prescribed. I do not accept that the general reference to the various authorities at (ROS [74]) or the mathematics of the non-parole period set, demonstrate that the sentencing judge misused the standard non-parole period. The process undertaken by the sentencing judge was not ""mechanistic"", rather her Honour assiduously identified all of the factors relevant to sentence which included the maximum penalty for murder and the recognition of the standard non-parole period as a ""reference point"" or ""benchmark"". Her Honour made an assessment of the objective gravity of the offending and considered all of the subjective features of the applicant before making a value judgement as to the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence. 

33I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge considered that the standard non-parole period was anything other than a marker. Her Honour did not treat her sentencing discretion as being tethered to the standard non-parole period. There is nothing in her remarks that suggests that her Honour was of the view that it had determinative significance. 

34The sentencing judge did, however, characterise the murder as being ""just above the mid-range."" In R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288, Basten JA (with whom Adams and Johnson JJ agreed), when discussing Muldrock observed at [19]: 

""What remains in doubt, however, is whether the sentencing judge is required or permitted to classify, or prohibited from classifying, the particular offence by reference to a low, middle or high range of objective seriousness."" 

35It is clear that there is no need to ""classify"" the offending or assess whether it falls in the middle range of objective seriousness. It may also be accepted that a sentencing judge is to continue to assess the objective seriousness of the offence: Muldrock at [27]; Koloamatangi at [19]. As Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [46]: 

""Assessment of the objective gravity of an offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]. It is an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis, a purpose of which is the imposition of a proportionate sentence, which adequately punishes an offender: s 3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""

36It seems to me that her Honour's classification of the murder as being ""just above the mid-range"" does not expose error of the kind identified in Muldrock. My conclusion would be different if a consideration of all of the sentencing remarks, revealed a two-stage approach or that the standard non-parole period had determinative significance in the sentence. 

37Mr Dhanji suggested in the course of oral argument that a reference to the standard non-parole period as a guideline or benchmark has a different meaning after Muldrock. A similar argument was advanced in Butler which Davies J rejected. His Honour said at [27]: 

""To suggest that the words ""yardstick"" or ""guideline"" might now carry some different emphasis or meaning by reason of matters in Muldrock is to apply an overly analytical approach to the use of those terms."" 

38There is no substance in the applicant's complaint that the sentencing judge's view as to the objective gravity of the offence appears to have been influenced by the earlier rejection of provocation. The focus of this debate is her Honour's remarks at (ROS [72]) that she could make ""no positive finding in [the applicant's] favour as to what caused him to kill Ms Wilkinson, or that the killing was provoked by Ms Wilkinson."" 

39The sentencing judge made these remarks in her discussion of mitigating factors. The applicant bore the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that he had been provoked by the deceased, which he failed to do. Her Honour's assessment of objective seriousness was not inflated by the absence of provocation. 

40Following the decision in Muldrock, there has been some debate about the range of factors to be considered in determining the objective seriousness of a standard non-parole period offence. The High Court held at [27] that the objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters ""personal to a particular offender"", but is to be determined ""wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"". In Koloamatangi, Basten JA said at [18] that Muldrock limits the range of factors to be considered in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. In Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49, RA Hulme J reviewed at [28] - [37] the cases in which the issue had been discussed. As it had not been the subject of submissions in the appeal, his Honour was of the view that it was unnecessary to decide the issue. 

41Senior counsel for the applicant did submit that provocation (or the absence of it) was not, after Muldrock, to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence. For the reasons provided at [38] - [39] above, it is not strictly necessary to express a view, but as the subject was raised I propose to do so. 

42The objective seriousness of an offence is to be determined wholly by reference to the ""nature of the offending"". I do not think that the nature of the offending is to be confined to the ingredients of the crime, but may be taken to mean the fundamental qualities of the offence. In my view, where provocation is established such that it is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is a fundamental quality of the offending which may reduce its objective seriousness. It seems to me, that in those circumstances, there cannot be a realistic assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence unless the provocation is taken into account. The absence of provocation is not a factor of aggravation and does not increase the objective seriousness of the offence. 

43Notwithstanding this discussion, I am far from certain that, after Muldrock, whether proven provocation is taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence or as a matter personal to a particular offender, that there will be any practical impact upon the ultimate sentence. 

44I would reject the first ground of appeal, but even if error had been demonstrated, I am unpersuaded that some lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in giving weight to the 
applicant's prior use of illicit drugs thereby reducing the extent to which her Honour had regard to the applicant's prior good character. 

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to 
the applicant's youth, together with the inevitable length of his incarceration, and his good character when assessing his prospects of rehabilitation. 

45It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together. 

46The complaint of error in the second ground is that the sentencing judge gave ""weight"" to the prior illicit drug use whereas the third ground complains that the sentencing judge failed to have ""proper regard"" to various aspects of the applicant's subjective case and the inevitable length of the sentence. Although different terminology is used, both grounds raise questions of weight in the exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. It is well established that the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this Court are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [40]. 

47Mr Danji submitted that the sentencing judge should not have given weight to the applicant's revelation to Dr Westmore and to Dr Pulman of his use of illicit drugs. Mr Danji contended that the evidence was different to that in Aoun v R [2007] NSWCCA 292, where the offender's conduct was directly connected to the offence and militated against any finding that the offence was otherwise out of character, nor could it be said that the applicant's illicit drug use impacted upon the relationship between the applicant's character and his involvement in the offence. Another criticism was that the sentencing judge erred in failing to qualify the significance of the applicant's drug use in respect to the applicant's claim of good character. It was further argued that her Honour gave too much weight to the applicant's prior drug and alcohol use when determining his prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Danji submitted that her Honour erred in failing to have proper regard to the applicant's youth, the inevitable length of his incarceration and good character when finding that she could not be satisfied that he was unlikely to re-offend. Her Honour's acceptance at (ROS [62]) that the offence was ""entirely out of character"" did not sit happily with the lack of satisfaction that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend.

48The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge did not err in stating that the evidence of the applicant's significant illicit long-term drug use reduced the weight to be given to the evidence of good character. Furthermore, the sentencing judge was not obliged to find that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were good as her Honour was faced with a sentencing exercise involving a brutal murder for which she could not make any positive finding in the applicant's favour as to what caused him to strangle the deceased and then beat her with a shovel. 

49The focal points of the applicant's complaint are her Honour's remarks at (ROS [44] - [47]):
""There is also evidence, including Dr Westmore's opinion, which supports the view that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly having regard to his age, his conduct while in custody, his existing qualifications and intentions to pursue further studies and the ongoing support which he has from his family. That evidence must, however, be considered together with the evidence that he has not taken effective steps to deal with what appears to be a serious, longstanding problem with drugs and alcohol. 
As I said, the evidence shows that the offender has a strong subjective case. There is evidence that he was previously of good character. However, the evidence of his significant long term use of illicit drugs must also be taken into account. That reduces the weight which may be given to the evidence of good character (see Aoun v R [2007] NSWCCA 292 at [23]). 
That the offender is unlikely to reoffend, is in my view not a conclusion which may readily be reached. I note Dr Westmore's opinion that the offender's risk to the community is probably low. Nevertheless, given the evidence as to the circumstances in which he came to murder Ms Wilkinson and dispose of her body; the extreme nature of his violence, which Dr Westmore considered to be unexpected and unpredictable; and the absence of any evidence from the offender, that he is not likely to re-offend in future is, in my view, not a matter about which it is possible to be confident. 
It is also necessary to consider the evidence that the offender had consumed both cannabis and alcohol before he committed the offence. The offender gave no evidence himself about what he consumed, but there is various evidence as to how much alcohol he had consumed and conflicting evidence as to how it affected him. The offender told Dr Westmore that he had been heavily intoxicated and that he would not have lost control in the same way, if he had not used alcohol and drugs that night.""

50A lack of previous convictions (s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and good character (s 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) are mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Sections 21A(3)(e) and s 21A(3)(f) reflect the rejection of the notion that 'good character' is synonmous with the absence of prior criminal convictions: see Melbourne v The Queen [1999] HCA 32; (1999) 198 CLR 1 at [108]-[109].

51An assessment of good character involves a consideration of all of what is known of an offender's character, which may include uncharged, but established criminal conduct: Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [32]; Aoun v R at [23]. 

52The positive aspects of the applicant's character were undoubtedly strong. In addition to his lack of a criminal history, his impressive work record included the completion of an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner and being named as Victoria's apprentice of the year. Although aged 22, he had purchased a home that he was paying off. There was, however, before the sentencing judge the material in the reports of Dr Westmore and Dr Pulman of the applicant's long term use of illicit drugs. 

53Before the remarks I have quoted at [49] above were made, the sentencing judge had thoroughly considered all of the applicant's positive subjective features. The sentencing judge had accepted at (ROS [32]) the applicant's submission that he had a strong subjective case. Her Honour, however, was not obliged to disregard the evidence of long term use of illicit drugs. 

54It was for the applicant to prove good character on the balance of probabilities. The sentencing judge was entitled to take into account all of what was known, both positive and negative of the applicant's character prior to the murder. Her Honour cited Aoun at [23] where Hodgson JA said: 

""However, in order that a judge take into account an accused's good character as working in his favour, this is a matter that needs to be proved on the balance of probabilities: see R v. Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, Weininger v. The Queen [2003] HCA 14, 212 CLR 629. In my opinion, if there is evidence suggesting criminal conduct other than that for which an offender is being punished, that may be taken into account by a sentencing judge in deciding whether or not the accused has shown previous good character on the balance of probabilities; and in my opinion also, this does not offend either Ryan or R v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383: see Weininger at pars.[31]-[33].""

55I do not agree with the applicant's submission, that Hodgson JA's remarks are to be confined to evidence suggesting criminal conduct that was directly connected to the crime for which an offender stands for sentence or that it impacts on the relationship between the offender's character and involvement in that crime. It defies common sense that established criminal conduct disassociated from the offending itself cannot form part of an assessment of a claim of good character. 

56It was well within the proper exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion to reduce the weight to be afforded to the evidence of good character, because of the illicit drug use. Her Honour was not obliged to qualify the significance of the reduction in weight that had been assessed. I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in the way in which the sentencing judge had regard to the evidence of illicit drug use. I would reject the second ground of appeal. 

57As to the third ground of appeal, the unlikehood of re-offending and good prospects of rehabilitation (whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise) are mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence: s 21A(3)(g); s 21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The onus of establishing these mitigating factors was on the applicant on the balance of probabilities. 

58It is plain that her Honour took into account in the applicant's favour when assessing his prospects of rehabilitation, his relative youth, his family support, the evidence of prior good character and existing qualifications, his good conduct in custody, his remorse, and Dr Westmore's opinion that the applicant's general risk to the community was ""probably low"". 

59Her Honour weighed against these favourable considerations, the evidence as to the circumstances in which the applicant came to murder the deceased and to dispose of the body, the extreme nature of the violence which Dr Westmore described as being ""unexpected and unpredictable"", the applicant's failure to take effective steps to deal with a serious longstanding problem with drugs and alcohol and the absence of evidence from the applicant. Her Honour had been unable to make any positive finding in the applicant's favour as to what caused him to kill the deceased. 

60In these circumstances, it was open to the sentencing judge to be reticent about the applicant's future prospects and to conclude that it was not possible to be confident that the applicant was not likely to re-offend. There is no inconsistency between this conclusion and the finding that the murder was ""out of character"". As the Crown submitted, ""out of character"" refers to the disaccord between previous knowledge of the applicant and the specific offence committed, whereas any conclusion as to re-offending and the prospects of rehabilitation includes not only what was known of the applicant, but also the circumstances of the offending. 

61The sentencing judge's approach to the assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation was within the proper exercise of her sentencing discretion and I would reject ground 3 of the appeal. 

Ground 4: The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 

62It was contended for the applicant that the sentencing judge's classification of the offence as ""just above the mid range"" (even in the context of the principles that were applicable at the time of sentencing) was not justified. This was a spontaneous killing that did not involve sexual violence or gratuitous cruelty and the lack of explanation for the crime did not increase its seriousness. Moreover, the applicant had a strong subjective case. The Court was referred to a number of sentences in other cases and a comprehensive note of ""comparable cases"" was filed. The applicant submitted that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

63The Crown's response was that the sentencing judge correctly identified the objective seriousness of the offending and that general deterrence was an important element in determining an appropriate sentence. That being so, the applicant's subjective features, must not overshadow the objective seriousness of the offence. Both the head term and non-parole period were said to be within the exercise of sound sentencing discretion and the sentence was not manifestly excessive. The Crown filed a note in which she pointed to matters of distinction between the present case and what were said to be comparable by the applicant. 

64The applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust in order to make good his complaint that the sentence is manifestly excessive: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. Intervention by this court is neither warranted simply because it might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the sentencing judge: Markarian at [28]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57], nor simply because the sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59]. Whilst prior decisions and sentencing statistics are helpful when they assist in identifying a range or pattern of sentences for a particular offence, each case must be considered in the light of its own facts. No two cases are the same and there is no single correct sentence: Markarian at [27].

65In my opinion, the criticism of the sentencing judge's characterisation of the seriousness of the murder is not made out. Her Honour aptly described the brutality of the crime at (ROS [34]):

""In this case, not only was Ms Wilkinson strangled, which has been described as 'a horrible way to die' (see Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76), she was repeatedly struck with a shovel. Those blows finally caused her death, with the asphyxiation contributing. The offender told police that she was already dead when he struck her. That belief appears to have been wrong, but the evidence certainly suggests that she was, by then, unconscious. She was patently defenceless. ""

66The spontaneity of the offence does little to diminish its seriousness. After strangling the deceased in a ""head lock type position"" from behind, the applicant did not refrain from his attack, but went on to repeatedly hit her to the head with the shovel, resulting in large lacerations lateral to the right eye, scalp of the forehead and back of the skull, with comminuted fractures of the base of the skull and fractures of the right frontal skull, left occipital skull and right orbit. When balanced against the seriousness of the offence, I do not think that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's strong subjective case. 

67The cases relied upon by the applicant do not persuade me that the sentence was outside a legitimate exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. 

68The applicant has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Orders

69Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

1.Leave to appeal granted. 

2.Appeal dismissed. 

70S.G CAMPBELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Price J for the reasons he gives. With great respect, I acknowledge the force of the President's reasoning from [2] to [4]. For that reason it is well to emphasise that like Allsop P and Price J, in any event, I am not of the opinion that any other sentence is warranted in law.

2759866,"R v PERRY, Steven William (a/k/a BABBAGE, Steven William) [2012] NSWSC 1645","remarks on sentence

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, who is best known as Steven Perry, was charged with Neil Madden with the murder of a man called Daniel Sullivan on 8 January 2011. That charge is now not proceeded with against either man. Mr Madden has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Sullivan and his proceedings on sentence have been adjourned.

2Today, Mr Perry pleaded guilty to a charge of concealing a serious offence, the relevant serious offence being the manslaughter of Mr Sullivan by Mr Madden. He now stands for sentence for that offence. That is an offence under s316 of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of two years. The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 28 March 2011, a period which I understand is some 16 months and 17 days. So he has now been in custody for something fairly close to the maximum sentence prescribed for this offence.

3I have the benefit of a statement of facts, exhibit A in these proceedings, which is as follows: 

""The Pleas

Madden has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Daniel Sullivan on the basis of a dangerous and unlawful act.

The dangerous and unlawful act involved Mr Madden throwing a quantity of methylated spirits on the coat of the deceased and igniting that liquid with a cigarette lighter.

Perry has pleaded guilty to the offence of concealing a serious offence, namely, the manslaughter of Sullivan by Madden.

Perry had been informed by police on the morning of 9 January 2011 that Daniel Sullivan was deceased.

Facts Generally

Neil Madden was living with a woman at Parramatta until 31 December 2010. He was a chronic drug user and alcoholic who had for many years been homeless. His relationship with Maree Campbell ended on New Year's Eve when she told him to leave her home at Parramatta.

Madden and his close friend, Stephen Perry, who was also a homeless alcoholic, then went to the home unit of Daniel Sullivan at Iwunda Street, Lalor Park, where they stayed until the night of the fire on 8 January 2011.

Daniel Sullivan lived alone in the Housing Commission unit. He was suffering serious ill-health, malnutrition and alcoholism and was reputed to have weighed about 35kg at the time of his death.

Madden and Perry stayed at Sullivan's unit where they consumed large quantities of alcohol and reportedly some illicit drugs, mainly cannabis.

Sullivan, like Madden, was known to become aggressive or at least argumentative when intoxicated and in the days before his death told neighbours that he wanted Madden to leave. Arguments between Madden, Sullivan and sometimes Perry were overheard by neighbours during that time.

Around 10pm on 8 January 2011 neighbours heard arguing and loud voices coming from Sullivan's unit. A neighbour below the unit heard loud voices from an argument shortly before hearing a thud on the floor, which she believed was not furniture falling, which she had earlier heard, but someone falling to the floor.

A few moments later other neighbours observed that Sullivan's unit was on fire and that the front door was closed. One of the neighbours unsuccessfully tried to open the door, believed it was locked and kicked it in. He was unable to enter the unit because of the heat and flames that had engulfed the interior.

The body of the deceased was found, severely burned, on the floor of the living room adjacent to the lounge. The fire had engulfed the unit and the complex was severely damaged.

Post-mortem examination of Sullivan was unable to establish a cause of death, however, from the absence of inhaled soot, fire or heat injury to the trachea or lungs and a normal carbon dioxide level in the blood the deceased died before the fire took hold.

The most likely mechanism of death is that the deceased suffered some form of cardiac arrest upon, or immediately following, having been set on fire.

Additional facts Perry

Within minutes of the fire starting a passer by saw and spoke briefly to Perry who was standing near the letterboxes outside the unit complex. He was joined a few moments later by Madden who was wearing only shorts and carrying some cloth who said to him 'let's go' and they walked away.

Perry left the scene and walked to Seven Hills railway station (his image captured on CCTV) where he caught a train to Central Station (his image again captured on CCTV) then Kings Cross railway station. He went to the 'shelves' (an underground car park at Woolloomooloo used as shelter by homeless people) where he remained the rest of the night before attending the Matthew Talbot hostel at Woolloomooloo for breakfast.

Outside the hostel he spoke to Vincent Curtis and said: 'Neil did something bad last night ... You'll read about it in the papers'. At the time Perry was seen to be upset. He told the same thing to Robert Campbell whilst having breakfast at the hostel. A short time later two police officers (Detectives Anderton and Papandrea) walked in and Perry said 'I hope they're not cops'.

On 9 January 2011 he was spoken to by investigating police at Matthew Talbot and at the police station and he told the police that he left the unit after waking up, hearing an argument and smelling smoke. He said nothing about the events that led to the lighting of the deceased or the unit by Madden.

Perry was again interviewed by police on 28 March 2011 and while he agreed to be interviewed declined to make any comment about the circumstances surrounding the death of Daniel Sullivan.

During the intervening period he was in frequent and regular contact with Neil Madden and they talked about the events surrounding the death of Sullivan. Madden told Perry to tell the police that he (Perry) had gone. Madden told Perry to stick to the story agreed earlier.""

4The plea of guilty is not entered on the basis that Mr Perry had knowledge of everything Mr Madden did leading to the death of the deceased, but it is entered on the basis that he was privy to information material to the investigation of that crime and that he failed to bring that information to the attention of the authorities.

5Subjectively, I have to say the offender presents as a rather sad figure. It is unclear when he was born; all that can be said is that it was some time in the early 1960s. He has no family and for some years has been homeless. It appears he has some significant health problems about which his counsel, Mr Hoyle SC, told me, but I don't need to go into the detail of those.

6He has a criminal history which includes, significantly, a conviction in 1985 for murder. In the following year that conviction was set aside and a verdict of guilty of manslaughter was substituted by the Court of Criminal Appeal and he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. I have no information about that case except that I'm given to understand that his liability for that homicide was accessorial.

7I am told that, notwithstanding the non-parole period set by the Court of Criminal Appeal, he was in fact released in 1990. Since that time he has a few sporadic entries on his criminal history but nothing of any great significance. So it can fairly be said that his criminal history in recent times is favourable. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the time he has already served awaiting sentence is adequate, quite possibly more than adequate to mark the criminality of the offence to which he has pleaded guilty. 

8What he will do upon his release is unclear. It seems likely that he will need to seek assistance from residential care for homeless people such as the Matthew Talbot Hostel. It is hoped that in due course some more permanent arrangement can be made for him. 

9In a perfect world one might impose a sentence comprising a non-parole period and balance of term, so that he had the benefit of parole supervision upon his release and the assistance which that would afford him. To do so in this case would be an error of principle involving a total sentence greater than the offence calls for, and close to, if not actually, the maximum sentence prescribed for the offence. The appropriate course in my view is to impose a fixed term which expires today. The Crown Prosecutor very properly has put no argument to the contrary. It is for those reasons that I decline to set a non-parole period. 

10Please stand, Mr Perry. For the offence to which you've pleaded guilty you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 16 months and 17 days commencing on 28 March 2011 and expiring today, 17 August 2012.


HIS HONOUR: Any other matters? 
CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour. 

HOYLE: No, your Honour.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Before your Honour rises, one matter I might raise, given that Mr Madden's matter is still continuing; that it would be expected that Mr Perry would not approach any witnesses in the case in the interim. 

HIS HONOUR: I understand that, which would be expert witnesses? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Any witnesses. 

HOYLE: No problem. My friend raised this with me. I have spoken to Mr Perry.

HIS HONOUR: I see Mr Perry nodding in the dock. 

OFFENDER: I don't want to see him.

HIS HONOUR: I accept that, that you won't approach them. 


Amendment

The length of sentence was miscalculated in Court. His Honour's intention was that the expiry date was the date on which sentence was passed, 17 August 2012 (see [11] above). Accordingly, the sentence was amended to a fixed term of imprisonment for 16 months and 21 days, commencing on 28 March 2011 and expiring on 17 August 2012.

		22 February 2013",2012-08-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759867,R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  On 17 August 2012 this Court unanimously dismissed the Crown's appeal against the sentence of the respondent, Daniel Nykolyn. Reasons for the decision to dismiss the appeal were reserved. I set out my reasons below. 
2The respondent pleaded guilty to the following offences:
1.Break and enter with intent to steal in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the aggravation pleaded was that the respondent knew that there was a person present within the said dwelling house). The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years.
2.Break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely stealing, contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years.
3.Enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (stealing) in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 111(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the aggravation pleaded was that the respondent knew that there was a person present within the said dwelling house). The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years.
4.Break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely stealing, contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years.
3There were two Form 1 documents. The first of the Form 1 documents included an offence of enter building with intent contrary to s 114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment, together with an offence of enter dwelling house with intent to steal in circumstances of aggravation, contrary to s 111(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the aggravation pleaded was that the respondent knew that there was a person present within the dwelling house). This offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
4The sentencing judge indicated that he had regard to these two offences when dealing with count 3. 
5The second of the Form 1 documents included 4 offences, namely, disposal of stolen property, contrary to s 189 of the Crimes Act 1900; furnish false statement contrary to s 15(4) of the Pawnbrokers and Second Hand Dealers Act 1996; and two counts of having custody of unlawfully obtained goods contrary to s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The sentencing judge had regard to these offences when sentencing in relation to count 1.
6A statement of agreed facts was tendered to the sentencing judge. Although his Honour did not set it out in his remarks on sentence, it may be comfortably assumed that he had regard to it. A summary of the facts has been prepared by the Crown for the purpose of this appeal, which I gratefully adopt.
Factual background.
7Count 1, the offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, occurred at approximately 10.30 pm on 27 February 2011 at residential premises situated in Redfern. The premises are situated on the first floor of a complex which also consists of a number of shops at street level. The sole occupant of those premises was Ms Letwin Jumbi, a 27 year old woman. On the evening in question Ms Jumbi was sitting at a table in the combined lounge dining room of her apartment working on her computer when she heard a noise coming from her bedroom. She looked up to see the respondent standing approximately 3 metres away from her. She observed that the respondent was wearing white gloves. Ms Jumbi told the respondent to take whatever he wanted and not to hurt her. She then started screaming. The respondent ran towards the front door and left the apartment. 
8Unbeknown to Ms Jumbi, shortly before she encountered the respondent in her apartment, a neighbour had observed him climb up a tree to the awning adjoining the apartments and walk along the awning, peering into the apartments. The neighbour rang the police, who arrived to find Ms Jumbi screaming. Ms Jumbi told the police that the respondent had just left and indicated the route that he took. The police saw the respondent on Cope Street and gave chase. The respondent ran into the fire escape of a building and locked the door behind him. The police were unable to locate the respondent, however upon re-tracing their steps they found a glove that the respondent had discarded as he ran. No property was taken by the respondent from Ms Jumbi's apartment. The respondent was later identified by Ms Jumbi by way of a photo identification procedure.
9Count 2, the offence of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence occurred on the evening of 24 February 2011 at residential premises situated at Arthur Street, Randwick. The premises are located on the first floor at the rear of a multi-storey unit complex. At about 6.20 pm that evening, Ms Rachel Hoskins left her apartment, closing the windows and locking the doors as she went. When she returned later that evening she noticed that a large quantity of her property was missing. Missing items included jewellery, a camera, a computer, an iPod, shoes, underwear, perfume and other personal items. The police conducted a fingerprint examination of the premises and located a fingerprint on the window frame in the bedroom. The fingerprint was subsequently analysed and found to match the fingerprint of the respondent.
10Count 3, the offence of aggravated enter dwelling with intent occurred at approximately 3.00 am on Tuesday 1 March 2011 at residential premises situated at Baptist Street, Redfern. The premises consist of a two-storey terrace house which, at the time, was occupied by Mr Maximillian Raeder and three flatmates. Mr Raeder occupied a bedroom with a balcony that faced the street. At about 3.00 am Mr Raeder woke up to find the respondent in his bedroom sifting through the drawers of a low-boy. The respondent turned, looked at Mr Raeder and then ran out of the balcony door. He then jumped down into the front yard and ran in a northerly direction along Baptist Street. As he ran from the room he knocked Mr Raeder's computer to the ground. Mr Raeder subsequently discovered that the respondent had stolen his mobile phone, his watch and a pair of sunglasses. He also discovered that his computer was damaged and no longer worked. Mr Raeder subsequently identified the respondent in a photographic line up.
11Count 4, the offence of break and enter and commit serious indictable offence occurred during the early hours of 2 March 2011 at residential premises situated at Burton Street, Darlinghurst. The premises are located on the second floor of a complex with a balcony overlooking a rear laneway. The premises were occupied by Mr Michael Young. Mr Young left the unit at 10.30 pm on Tuesday 1 March 2011, locking all doors and windows behind him. When he returned to the unit the following day at 10.30 pm he found a black backpack on the balcony which contained a number of items belonging to a neighbour who also resided in the complex. (This relates to Item 1 on the first Form 1 - the charge of enter building with intent). Mr Young reported the matter to the concierge of the complex who looked through CCTV security footage that showed the respondent climbing onto balconies at the complex at 3.45 am on 2 March 2011. The respondent stole a number of items from the unit including two laptop computers, a camera lens, various DVD's and a number of towels and wash cloths.
12At about 11.30 pm on Wednesday 2 March 2011, police officers patrolling the Redfern area pulled over a vehicle being driven by the respondent's sister. The respondent was seated in the rear seat of the vehicle. He was placed under arrest and searched. He was found to be in possession of property including a mobile phone, a camera, two phone chargers and a number of DVDs and CDs. At that time the respondent declined to take part in a record of interview.
13On 6 June 2011 the respondent agreed to take part in a record of interview and admitted to committing the offence at Arthur Street Randwick. He stated that he went to Randwick for the purpose of finding a place to break into. He said he chose those premises because they were private and because there were no security cameras. He said that he ""scoped"" the property, then climbed up the balconies and checked the windows from the balcony before placing all the items in a backpack. He said that he later sold the items for cash.
The Form 1 matters
14Item 2 in the first Form 1 document is a charge of aggravated enter dwelling with intent. At about 10 pm on 1 March 2011, the respondent climbed onto the first floor balcony of a residential complex at Anzac Parade, Kensington. At the time, the occupant, Mr Tamanumulliag was having dinner in his living room with a friend when he heard a noise coming from his bedroom. He walked into the bedroom and saw the respondent standing in the doorway wearing white gloves. The respondent lunged towards Mr Tamanumulliag and then ran from the apartment, taking with him a wallet containing cash and other personal items. Mr Tamanumulliag's laptop was later located in the balcony floor. The respondent was subsequently identified in a photographic line up.
15The second Form 1 document contains 4 offences. The first two offences occurred on 11 February 2011, when the respondent attended a pawn shop and disposed of an Oris brand watch that had been stolen from residential premises at Glenmore Road, Paddington on 7 February 2011. The respondent also signed a pledge document stating that he was the legal owner of the watch. The other two offences relate to the property found in possession of the respondent at the time of his arrest.
Subjective matters
16The respondent was aged 32 at the time he was sentenced. He has a criminal history which includes convictions for robbery in company, break enter and steal, assault police and escape from lawful custody. He has served several periods of full time custody since 1998, which have varied in length from 1 months imprisonment to 18 months imprisonment. On 25 October 2007 he was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months for an offence of robbery in company. He was released to parole on 26 August 2008. The present offences were committed shortly after the expiration of his parole period.
17The respondent did not give evidence on sentence. However, three reports were tendered on his behalf. The first was a drug and alcohol report prepared by Mr David Rowe, a Services and Programs officer from the South Coast Correction Centre. Mr Rowe stated:
""The impression gained of Mr Nykolyn is that he is a man with reasonable insight into the problem that has developed as part of his substance abuse. Although he states that he recognises that his drug use has brought him to a point of crisis, and he needs to take a closer look at the issues involved, and at how his behaviour has led to his present circumstance. Further questioning revealed he, in fact has little true understanding of himself, his behaviour or problems. Mr Nykolyn has a tendency to minimize his substance use and his criminal lifestyle in order to manipulate himself to continued use substance and maintain his current lifestyle (sic). He has developed a dependence on drug use over a period of years and seems to have learned early in life that substance abuse can provide temporary relief from emotional pain.
...The onset of mental illness which he states was triggered by the use of Crystal-methamphetamine (sic). He self medicated for period (sic) to attempt to resolve his undiagnosed schizophrenia and has over the years attempted to manage his mental health this way. Mr Nykolyn states that when on medication his mental health is good.""
18Mr Rowe expressed the opinion that the respondent requires long term rehabilitation and recommended a program directed at persons with drug abuse and mental health issues, such as the program conducted by the Salvation Army at the Macquarie Treatment Centre at Morriset.
19The second report was from Dr William Lucas, a psychiatrist. He prepared an assessment of the respondent in 2007 when he was to be sentenced for an unrelated offence of robbery in company committed in 2007. He records that the respondent was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2004. He was also diagnosed with poly-substance abuse, his principal drugs being heroin and cocaine. Dr Lucas found that the principal psychosocial stressors leading to the robbery offence were intoxication with alcohol and the effect of prohibited drugs. Dr Lucas found that, although the respondent's psychotic symptoms were not fully controlled by the treatment he was receiving for his schizophrenia, these symptoms were not responsible for his behaviour on the relevant night. The offence committed in 2007 was the subject of the previous proceedings. All of the offences for which the respondent was sentenced by Finnane DCJ took place in 2011 within February and March of that year, more than three years after the report was prepared by Dr Lucas.
20The third report was from Dr Olav Nielssen who assessed the respondent in February 2012. The respondent reported to Dr Nielssen that his offending was associated with his ceasing his medication and his use of prohibited drugs that had combined to bring a return of his symptoms of mental illness. Dr Nielssen found the respondent to be polite and well spoken but concluded that he was suffering from ""schizophrenic thought disorder"" which manifested itself in literal interpretations of questions, impairment of abstract thinking, and being easily distracted. His vocabulary, general knowledge and reasoning ability were otherwise assessed in the normal range.
21Dr Nielssen's conclusion was that the respondent suffered with chronic schizophrenia and had a substance dependence and abuse disorder. He was of the opinion that the respondent will require indefinite treatment in the form of psychotropic medication under the supervision of a community mental health team. He considered that his long term prognosis is directly related to the course of his substance abuse disorder.
22The respondent is the father of 3 children but has separated from his partner. The separation was primarily due to the respondent's drug addiction and the reluctance of his partner to have her children brought up in association with prohibited drugs.
Remarks of the sentencing judge
23The sentencing judge delivered his remarks on sentence ex tempore. His Honour did not set out the facts of the individual offences and did not differentiate in relation to their seriousness. His Honour identified that the respondent was entitled to a discount on sentence for his plea of guilty but did not quantify that discount. His Honour described each offence as serious but did not differentiate between them. His Honour commented on the effect upon a victim who has their home invaded and their property stolen.
24The sentencing judge concluded that the respondent was not a professional criminal but committed his crimes because of his drug addiction. His Honour concluded that each of the offences was an unplanned break and enter by a person who was seriously mentally ill. His Honour referred to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock which considered the correct approach when sentencing a person who is suffering from mental illness.
25The sentencing judge identified the respondent as a person in need of treatment and someone who ""should not have a crushing sentence imposed upon him."" His Honour also indicated that he believed the respondent should have a significant period on parole ""so that the Parole authorities can work with him and try to, with his assistance, stabilise his mental condition and stabilise his drug addiction.""
26His Honour was concerned that the respondent's mental illness may have the consequence that any period of full-time custody would be onerous for him. He also said that in his view rehabilitation was a very important factor and that it was important that the respondent gain access to an appropriate treatment facility. His Honour said:
""Although he is mentally ill he still has intelligence and free will. He can decide whether he goes somewhere or he does not. The parole authorities can make all sorts of recommendations to him. If he chooses not to take any notice of them well, nobody can make him. 
I am going to give him a chance of getting out in a relatively early time. I am imposing an aggregate sentence. In my opinion each of these four offences is of similar seriousness and each would warrant, taking into account a discount for early plea, a sentence of four years imprisonment. There would have to be a degree of accumulation. Because of his mental illness it is appropriate to impose a non-parole period which is very much less than the normal non-parole period which is applied.""
27His Honour did not proceed to define the individual sentences but proceeded to sentence the respondent to an aggregate sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months.
28There are five grounds of appeal which are as follows:
Ground 1:His Honour erred by categorising each offence as being of similar seriousness.
Ground 2:His Honour failed to properly take into account the offences on the Form 1.
Ground 3:His Honour erred by finding that the offences were not planned.
Ground 4:His Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the mental illness of the respondent.
Ground 5:His Honour erred in imposing a sentence that is manifestly inadequate.
29It will be apparent from the portions that I have related from the sentencing judge's remarks that there are a number of errors. The sentencing judge concluded that each offence was of similar seriousness and gave no indication of the impact of the matters on the Form 1 on the sentence for the relevant offences.
30The respondent accepted that his Honour had not dealt with those matters but submitted that the argument was technical and was ""precisely the sort of reasoning which the introduction of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was intended to overcome, that is, overly technical grounds of appeal which even if established would not affect the overall sentence.""
31Section 53A was introduced to ameliorate the difficulties that had emerged with the obligations required of a sentencing judge by reason of the High Court's decision in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. The section is in the following terms:
""(1)A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.
(2)A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following:
(a)the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,
(b)the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 of any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.
(3)Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.
(4)The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.
(5)An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.""
32Section 53A(1) allows a court to impose an aggregate sentence instead of a separate sentence of imprisonment for each count. However, s 53A(2) requires the sentencing judge to indicate to the offender the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. A sentencing judge is accordingly required to give consideration to the criminality involved in each offence and, where appropriate, have regard to any matters on a Form 1 when defining the sentence that would have been imposed for an individual offence. Subsection 5 will save from invalidity any aggregate sentence that has been imposed in circumstances where the sentencing judge has failed to comply with s 53A(2)(b) or any other requirement of the section.
33It follows that in the present case, although his Honour should have considered and recorded the sentence to be imposed for each individual offence, the failure to do so does not invalidate the sentence.
34The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was also in error when he said that the respondent was ""a drug addict engaging in unplanned break and enters"" and that his Honour should rather have found that the offences were planned. The foundation for this submission was the fact that the respondent was wearing gloves during the commission of the offences and had chosen property at Randwick because it had no security cameras. It was further submitted that the agreed facts disclosed that it was common ground that the offences were planned and that his Honour should have indicated to the parties that he had proposed to depart from this agreed fact.
35Counsel for the respondent submitted that the fact that the respondent carried gloves and examined premises before he broke into them is not inconsistent with the finding that the offences were unplanned. To my mind, this submission should be accepted. Although it is clear that the respondent had set about robbing premises to obtain goods that he could turn into cash, the extent of his planning was confined to an intention to carry out a robbery on premises that he found to be suitable. He had not otherwise set about planning the robbery of any particular premises, nor had he organised himself accordingly. To my mind, his Honour was not wrong to describe the offences as he did.
36At the heart of the sentencing of the respondent is his mental illness. There is no doubt that he is suffering from schizophrenia. The Crown submitted that the extent to which the respondent's schizophrenia mitigated the offences was limited because there was evidence before his Honour that the illness was triggered by the respondent's consumption of drugs and alcohol.
37It is clear from the reports tendered at the sentence hearing that the respondent has psychotic episodes when he ceases to take his mediation or resorts to the consumption of alcohol or prohibited drugs. However, in my opinion, the evidence does not determinatively show that the respondent's substance abuse ""triggered"" his illness. The respondent was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2004. Although the respondent indicated to both Mr Rowe and Dr Nielssen that he believed that his illness was triggered by his use of methylamphetamine, the respondent gave a history of drug use in which he claimed to have first used that drug in 2007, three years after his diagnosis. Neither Mr Rowe, nor Dr Nielssen express an opinion about what may have ""triggered"" the respondent's schizophrenia.
38The principles relevant to the sentencing of a person who is suffering from mental illness or intellectual handicap have been considered in many cases. I endeavoured to summarise them in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177] - [178], where I said:
""Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Cnm R 67, R v Tsianas [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400, R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] - [48], Launtsen v R [2000] WASCA 203, (2000) 114 A Cnm R 333 at [43] - [51], R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] - [45], R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36], R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32] Courtney vR [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18], and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28] They can be summarised in the following manner:
Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 at [254], Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23], RvJiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25], Tsiaras at 400, Launtsen at [51], Israil at [23], R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43], Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].
It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed Engert at 71, R v Wright (1997) 93 A Cnm R 48 at 50 - 51, Israil at [22], Pearson at [42], Henry at [28].
It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced Tsians at 400, Jimmez at [25], Israil at [26], Henry at [28].
It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence Courtney at [14], Tsiaras at 400, Israil at [25], JW at [192].
Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence Israil at [24], Henry at [28] Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].
I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence: R v Skura [2004] VSCA 53; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102; (2007) 16 VR 269 at [5].""
39For the reason that the respondent suffered from serious and long standing mental illness, in particular chronic schizophrenia, it was open to his Honour to fashion the sentence by giving general and specific deterrence less weight than in the usual case. It was also appropriate for his Honour to emphasis the need for rehabilitation. Accordingly, in so far as Ground 4 asserts his Honour's approach to this issue was in error, it must be rejected. 
40The question that arises is whether, in the result, the non-parole period that his Honour imposed was manifestly inadequate, requiring the intervention of this Court (Ground 5).
41The Crown does not submit that the total term of the respondent's sentence was manifestly inadequate. The argument was directed to the non-parole period. It was submitted that his Honour, in his brief remarks on sentence, did not make plain whether he had had regard to all of the matters relevant to the offences, correctly identified the criminality involved and had regard to any matters of aggravation when identifying the non-parole period which he imposed. It was submitted that by imposing a non-parole period of 18 months with a head sentence of 7 years, a ratio of 21.42% (compared with the statutory ratio of 75%), his Honour had given excessive weight to the respondent's mental illness and his need for rehabilitation.
42The Crown emphasised that for the offence committed in 2007 the respondent was sentenced to a head sentence of 4 years. Shortly after the sentence had expired the respondent had offended again. The Crown submitted that, by his conduct, the respondent had disavowed any intention to rehabilitate himself and that, accordingly, the need for rehabilitation did not justify a finding of special circumstances.
43It was submitted that in light of the number of offences, the matters on the Form 1, the respondent's criminal history, the maximum penalty for the offences and the weight properly given to the respondent's mental illness the non-parole period should have been greater.
44The sentencing of the respondent was difficult. But for his history of significant mental illness, his record and the seriousness of the offences which he committed would have required a sentence with a non-parole period significantly greater than was imposed by his Honour. Offences which are committed by intruding into a person's home with the intention of taking their property are serious and demand significant punishment. This is recognised by the fact that the legislature has imposed a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for the various offences that the respondent committed.
45The difficulty in relation to the respondent is that after he was sentenced for the offences in 2007 and later released to parole he was able to re-establish himself in the community without offending. Notwithstanding his mental illness, he did not offend again until after his parole period had expired and he regressed into consuming prohibited drugs. This suggests that if he is able to obtain effective treatment and responds appropriately to it, there is a real chance that he can be rehabilitated and become a law abiding member of the community. He is a man of 32 years of age and, as described by his Honour, has a physical capacity which would enable him to obtain employment suitable to his level of intellectual and emotional functioning. By imposing a relatively short non-parole period, but a lengthy period on parole, his Honour ensured that the respondent would receive the benefit of supervision while on parole together with the prospect that, if he offended during that time, he would be returned to prison. It seems that that possibility had operated as an effective disincentive for him to offend after he was sentenced in 2007. It is reasonable to assume that this will again be the case in relation to the sentence which his Honour imposed.
46His Honour recognised the need for the respondent to receive effective and appropriate psychiatric treatment. So much is obvious. His Honour concluded that this treatment could best be provided in the community, the facilities within the prison system being less suitable. I am not persuaded that this finding was inappropriate. It influenced his Honour's decision to provide a relatively short non-parole period. There was no error in his Honour reaching this conclusion. 
47Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences that the respondent committed I am satisfied that the approach that his Honour took was, in all the circumstances, available. Although a longer period of fulltime custody would not have been inappropriate, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate requiring the intervention of this Court.
48Although the respondent filed an application for leave to appeal no submission was made to support it. It was filed only to protect the respondent in relation to the head sentence if the Crown appeal was upheld.
Orders
49The orders made by the Court were:1.Crown appeal dismissed.2.Respondent's application for leave to appeal dismissed.
50HALL J:  I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL for the decision to dismiss the appeal by order made on 17 August 2012.
51I also agree with the reasons of Hulme J and the observations made by his Honour in respect of the provisions of s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
52R A HULME J:  I joined in the decision to dismiss the Crown appeal at the conclusion of the hearing on 17 August 2012 and did so generally for the reasons given by McClellan CJ at CL.
53A non-parole period of 18 months against an aggregate sentence of 7 years is undoubtedly lenient.  But I believe that it was not beyond the boundaries of the sentencing judge's discretion to take the approach that he did.
54Even if the view was taken that the 18 month non-parole period was unduly lenient to the point of being erroneous, there was a powerful factor warranting the appeal being dismissed in the exercise of this Court's residual discretion.  The appeal was heard only two weeks before the respondent was to become eligible for release on parole on 1 September 2012.  An affidavit by the respondent's solicitor provided evidence that he had been accepted into a residential rehabilitation program at Odyssey House, and that a Probation and Parole Officer had recommended release on parole on condition that he enter that program.
55I wish to take the opportunity to make some observations about the relatively new aggregate sentencing provisions in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. They were inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010 and took effect from 14 March 2011.
56McClellan CJ at CL has referred (at [31] - [32]) to the provisions of s 53A, including the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) that a court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.  In an apparent attempt to give effect to this requirement, the sentencing judge in this case said:
""I am imposing an aggregate sentence.  In my opinion each of these four offences is of similar seriousness and each would warrant, taking into account the discount for early plea, a sentence of four years imprisonment.  There would have to be a degree of accumulation.""
57With respect to the judge, this would appear to be doing little more than paying lip service to the requirement in s 53A(2)(b).  I do not understand how the same sentence for each offence can be justified.  True it is that they were offences of a similar (but not identical) nature and that the maximum penalty for each was the same.  However, the judge was asked to take into account further offences when he sentenced for two of the offences; a reason in itself for the individual sentences to vary.  The judge appears to have taken a similar approach to that taken by the sentencing judge in R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199, described there (at [26]) as applying a ""blanket assessment"".
58The importance of proper compliance with the requirement to indicate the separate sentences that would have been imposed arises for at least four reasons.  First, it assists a sentencing judge in application of the totality principle, an important factor in the assessment of the aggregate sentence to be imposed.  Secondly, it exposes for appellate review how it is that the aggregate sentence was arrived at: see R v Brown at [17] per Grove AJ.  Thirdly, it allows victims of crime and the public at large to understand the level of seriousness with which a court has regarded an individual offence. Fourthly, it assists this Court to assess an appropriate new aggregate sentence if one or some of the underlying convictions are quashed on appeal.
59In relation to the last matter, if one or more of the underlying convictions are quashed on appeal, whilst this Court does not know what the judge at first instance might have imposed by way of aggregate sentence in respect of the remaining convictions, the indicative sentences for the individual offences provides a useful guide to the task of re-sentencing.  There is a recent example of this Court having to engage in such an exercise: FP v R [20120] NSWCCA 182 at [327] - [329].
60These four matters are the types of considerations that informed the inclusion of s 53A(2) in the aggregate sentencing provisions.  In the second reading speech for the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Bill 2010, the Honourable Michael Veitch on behalf of the then Attorney General stated:
""The reasons for setting out the precise details of each sentence are to ensure transparency, reflect criminality and ensure that victims get due recognition. This also makes it easier to adjust an overall sentence when one sentence is changed on appeal. Those principles remain important, but in order to simplify the sentencing process for the judiciary, and for the community's understanding of it, the Government has decided to remove the requirement to specify the precise detail of any overlap between the sentences by allowing it to set one overall sentence and one non-parole period, provided that the court first indicates the appropriate sentence that would have been given for each offence had it been sentenced individually. The amendments will allow the judge to approach sentencing for multiple offences in a simple way when appropriate and lead to a sentence which is simpler and more easily understood by all."" (New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 November 2010 at 27867)""

2759879,Ram v R [2012] NSWCCA 177,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: Ms Sharleen Ram (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon her in the District Court at Newcastle on 5 November 2010.

3For an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years, his Honour Judge Coolahan imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months.

4For an offence of intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical harm, contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of 50 penalty units, there was a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months. 

5Finally, for an offence of threatening a witness with intent to influence her to give false evidence, there was a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 2 months. It is not clear whether this was an offence against s 322 or s 323 of the Crimes Act. The indictment nominates the former but the wording of the count is more consistent with the latter. An element of the former but not the latter is threatening to cause, or causing, injury or detriment but this was not averred. The maximum penalties prescribed for these offences are 10 years and 7 years respectively. No point was taken in relation to this and nothing now turns on it.

6At the applicant's request, a further offence of influencing a witness (Crimes Act s 323(a)) was taken into account when sentence was imposed for the third offence.

7There was a degree of partial accumulation of the sentences whereby the total effective sentence was one of 3 years 3 months with a non-parole component of 1 year 5 months. The sentence took effect from 27 October 2009. The applicant was released to parole on 26 March 2011.

8A notice of application for leave to appeal containing a single ground of appeal was filed almost 12 months after the applicant's release on parole. It is stated in the written submissions for the applicant that ""no issue is otherwise taken on appeal with the individual and/or total sentences imposed"". The ground of appeal is:

The sentencing judge erred in imposing the individual and/or total sentences imposed in that he:

a) failed to give full and proper weight to the extra-curial punishment suffered by the applicant; and 

b) failed to consider the exceptional hardship suffered by the applicant's family, particularly her child born in custody, as a result of the applicant's incarceration.

9It is unnecessary to refer to the facts of the offences, the applicant's subjective circumstances generally or findings made by the learned judge. The ground of appeal is confined to a discrete issue concerned with the fact that the applicant was pregnant when she went into custody on 27 October 2009. She had been on bail after being charged with the first and second offences but was refused bail following commission of the third offence. She gave birth in a hospital in March 2010 but remained in custody until she was sentenced in November 2010. At the time of sentencing she also had a child who was then 2 years of age.

10The applicant was represented by counsel at the hearing in the District Court. No case was sought to be made on the basis of ""extra-curial punishment"" or ""exceptional hardship suffered by the applicant's family"". It has not been contended that counsel was in any way derelict in his duty to his client. It is also apparent from the transcript of the proceedings on sentence that the applicant had the same solicitor acting on her behalf for at least a year prior to sentencing.

11His Honour referred in his sentencing remarks to evidence that the applicant ""had to give birth to her youngest son in an environment with officers watching and being handcuffed to the bed. She said that her son was only hours old when he was taken from her and she was returned to prison"" (ROS 13). This was derived from a letter from the applicant that was tendered at the sentence hearing. She did not give evidence herself. The letter also included that she had ""emotional issues, from not being able to nurture my two babies"" and that she had been able to remain ""compassionate and caring ... even when I lost my breast milk from depression and was unable to continue expressing for my new born"". His Honour said that he accepted ""in general terms the material contained in the letter from the offender"" (ROS 16).

12His Honour also referred to evidence of the applicant's mother, which included that ""her daughter was extremely upset when she was separated from her recently born baby but said that she decided to focus her energy on being positive and what she can do to improve and assist herself when she is released"" (ROS 16). His Honour stated that he accepted the evidence of the applicant's mother. Her oral evidence included that the child had been taken from the applicant straight after the birth, that the applicant was sorry for having missed the first six months of his life, and that she was receiving counselling for post natal depression (POS 19 - 20). 

13His Honour said that he was satisfied ""that the whole experience of being in custody, giving birth and having a child removed from her must have been traumatic and remains traumatic and is in a real sense a form of extra-curial punishment"" (ROS 16). 

14The aptness of the description ""extra-curial punishment"" is doubtful given that the matter at issue is a consequence of conviction and sentence which does not relate to the offences the applicant committed: see Silvano v R [2008] NSWCCA 118; (2008) 184 A Crim R 593 at [24] - [36] per James J. Perhaps the learned sentencing judge was using the term in the ""expanded sense"" discussed by Basten JA in Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; (2010) 200 A Crim R 1 at [85] - [97]. However, it is unnecessary for the disposition of this application to dwell upon this.

15At a later stage in his sentencing remarks the judge announced a number of favourable findings concerning subjective matters. They included that the applicant had no significant criminal record; she had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend; her remorse was genuine; she had pleaded guilty; and that there should be a finding of special circumstances. His Honour added, ""I have already referred to the aspect of extra-curial punishment in her case which, in my view, is relevant to both the head sentence and the non-parole period."" He also said that there were additional reasons for a finding of special circumstances which included that it was the applicant's first time in custody and that she had young children (ROS 21).

16There was no criticism in the applicant's written submissions of the manner in which the sentencing judge dealt with the evidence that was before him. What was originally sought in the formulation of the ground of appeal, and in the written submissions in support of it, was to impugn his Honour's treatment of the issue of ""extra-curial punishment"" and to create a new issue of ""exceptional family hardship"" on the basis of evidence which was said to be fresh or new.

17In the written submissions the applicant sought to rely upon a number of affidavits which were proposed to be read at the hearing. Their contents were summarised in the written submissions as follows:

An affidavit by the applicant: ""setting out in full detail the precise circumstances surrounding the birth of her second child ...; the circumstances immediately following his birth; and the conditions the applicant experienced after her separation from her child on the same day - including experiencing ongoing depression and an inability to continue to express milk."" (AWS [15])

""Additional/updated medical evidence ... setting out the precise effect on the applicant of the circumstances surrounding the birth of her child and the effect on the applicant of her separation with her child from the day of his birth up until her release from custody over a year later"". (AWS [16])

""Medical evidence ... setting out the effect on the new born baby of his separation from the applicant"". (AWS [21])

18At the outset of the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant acknowledged the objection by the Crown to the reading of these affidavits. It was then, with commendable frankness and candour, conceded that the affidavits of the applicant, and a psychological report annexed to an affidavit by the applicant's solicitor, did not meet the requirements of fresh or new evidence that this Court may receive on an appeal against sentence. These concessions were appropriate. None of the material could be said to be that which was unknown or was unobtainable at the time of the sentencing hearing in the court below, nor did it relate to something the real significance of which was not apparent: see, for example, Stumbles v R [2006] NSWCCA 418 at [7] - [10] per Latham J. The evidence simply provided further details of matters that were already the subject of evidence.

19Another solicitor's affidavit annexed a report of a social worker, Ms Mary Jelen. It recounts various matters relating to the applicant's background that have no relevance to the ground of appeal; sets out further matters relating to the birth of her child which would have been known to the applicant well prior to the sentence hearing; gives second-hand accounts of the psychological impacts of giving birth to a child in custody on the applicant; refers to matters the applicant has experienced after having been released on parole; and purports to offer opinion evidence as to the ""range of social, behavioural and psychological difficulties in children"" separated by a parent's imprisonment which are very doubtfully within the author's expertise.

20Ms Jelen's report concludes with the following:

Liz Bachas from The Samaritan Foundation has confirmed Ms Ram has been reunited successfully with her children. Ms Bachus [sic] noted that the impact of separation and loss on the children was significant on all aspects of their development. However, she also noted that the mother and extended family have worked hard to minimise and eliminate difficulties experienced by the children. There is no doubt the children have adapted and have now formed a primary and healthy attachment to their mother.

21Counsel for the applicant conceded that the social worker's report ""suffers from the same fate"" as the earlier mentioned affidavits but maintained that Ms Jelen's reference to the hardship occasioned to the children was a matter that this Court could properly take into account. It was accepted that this portion of the evidence was not ""fresh or new"" but ""falls within that exceptional category where the Court receives it, albeit for the first time"". 

22I take this to be a reference to unusual cases in which this Court has received further evidence even though not strictly fresh or new: see the very useful discussion of principles generally relating to the admission of further evidence on an appeal against sentence by Simpson J in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; (2011) 209 A Crim R at [104] - [121].

23The evidence before the sentencing judge supported the favourable findings that he made in the assessment of sentence. The evidence now sought to be relied upon is really an attempt to make a better case for more favourable findings. Those findings were sought in support of a submission that the applicant should have received a sentence comprising a non-parole period expiring on the day of sentence. It was pointed out to counsel that any order this Court made could not change the fact that the applicant had remained in custody after sentencing for a further period of almost 5 months until she was released on parole in March last year. It was then submitted that there should be a shorter parole period. The current period of parole is due to expire next January.

24The evidence in the limited portion of the social worker's report that was ultimately relied upon could readily have been obtained prior to sentencing. No attempt has been made to explain why it was not placed before his Honour. As was recently observed by Adamson J in BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 128 at [20], with reference to Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [79] - [81]:

[T]his Court is a court of error. In sentencing appeals the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment. An appeal to this Court is not an opportunity to recast the case presented to the sentencing judge.

25I am not satisfied that receipt of even the limited portion of the material that was pressed for admission is justified in the interests of justice. The offences were of quite some seriousness and the sentences imposed were relatively modest. I am not persuaded that lesser sentences were warranted and should have been passed even if the additional evidence were to be taken into account: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

26I propose the following order:

Leave to appeal refused.

27SCHMIDT J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2759887,R v Gale; R v Duckworth [2012] NSWCCA 174,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J.

2SIMPSON J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the DPP"") pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against a ruling made on 5 April 2011 on the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings in which each of the respondents is charged with larceny, allegedly committed on 26 June 2006. Such an appeal lies only if the ruling ""eliminates or substantially weakens"" the prosecution case. Neither respondent has argued that the ruling does not have that quality, and there is therefore no jurisdictional hurdle to the appeal. The evidence in question is sought to be tendered as coincidence evidence pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995.

Background

3The following account is drawn from statements presented to the primary judge, and to this Court. Nothing in it is intended to represent a finding of fact: it is an account of the case the Crown proposes to make at trial.

4From 1982 to 1999, the respondent Wayne Alfred Duckworth (to whom I will refer by his surname) served as a member of the NSW Police Service. From 9 May 2006, he was employed by, and licensee of, the Nimbin Hotel. On 26 June 2006 he reported to local police that he had, at 7.15am on that day, at the hotel, been robbed at gunpoint of the proceeds of the previous day's trading. He made a statement in which he gave a detailed account of the alleged robbery. (The balance of this paragraph is an account of the content of that statement.) Duckworth described the offender as of Maori appearance, and large. He said that the offender had ordered him to face the wall, with a threat to shoot him if he did not. When he did this he pointed a silver coloured gun at Duckworth. While Duckworth faced the wall as directed, he heard the offender take money from the cash register and place it in a bag, which he then ordered Duckworth to take. He ordered Duckworth to walk down the stairs, and to his own (Duckworth's) car, and to drive the car according to the robber's directions. This was north towards Murwillumbah. Eventually, he told Duckworth to pull over to a clearing on the side of the road, and to alight from the vehicle. Throughout the drive he was pointing the gun at Duckworth. He ordered Duckworth to walk down a steep embankment, again threatening to shoot him. The offender then drove off in Duckworth's car. Duckworth vomited, and then walked to the side of the road, where he flagged down a passing vehicle, driven by Mr John Faust, an employee of Country Energy. Duckworth told Mr Faust that he had been robbed, had been driven to that location, and that he thought he was going to die. Mr Faust telephoned police, who attended shortly thereafter, and drove Duckworth to the Nimbin police station. Duckworth estimated that approximately $40,000 was taken from the hotel.

5At about 9.30am that day, Duckworth's car was observed in a laneway in Murwillumbah.

6It is the DPP's case that the account of the robbery given by Duckworth was a fabrication, and that Duckworth, in collaboration with Brett Terence Gale (""Gale"") (also a former member of the NSW Police Service) had himself stolen the money, that Gale had driven Duckworth in Duckworth's care to the Murwillumbah location, and had then driven off in Duckworth's car, leaving Duckworth to present himself to a passing motorist (as it happened, Mr Faust), as the victim of an offence.

7The case against Duckworth and Gale is largely circumstantial. There is evidence of an association between the two men prior to 26 June 2006. There is evidence of a number of mobile telephone calls made between Duckworth and Gale on and around 26 June. The evidence shows that both telephones were in the Murwillumbah area when the calls were made. There is evidence that both Duckworth and Gale were in financial difficulties and that Duckworth's expenditure exceeded his apparent income. There is evidence from other employees at the Nimbin Hotel that they did not observe anything untoward on the morning Duckworth reported the offence and in particular did not observe any intruder. There is evidence that a security camera at the hotel did not record anything consistent with the offence as described by Duckworth. There is evidence that Gale did not return to his employment after 26 June.

8The only direct evidence is that of a prison informer, known as a numbered registered source. (The prison informer gave evidence under his own name at the committal proceedings, but I consider it prudent not further to publish his name.) His evidence was that (in circumstances to which I will shortly come) he had met both Duckworth and Gale whilst an inmate in a Queensland prison, and that both had, independently, described the Nimbin offence to him, admitting their own involvement. The informer's statement and evidence contained a good deal of detail that can be corroborated. One example is his evidence that Duckworth told him that, out of the proceeds of the theft, he had purchased a red Commodore utility, of ""'95, '96, '97"" vintage. He said that he had purchased the vehicle for his stepson, paying about $7,800. The detail given by the informer was largely consistent with statements from a Mr and Mrs Shelley. Mrs Shelley operated a car parts business. For the purposes of the business she and her husband had a 1996 Commodore utility (which was white with grey interior). In July 2006 they decided to sell the vehicle, and placed it on eBay, with an asking price of $7,500. It was purchased by a man who called himself ""Wayne"", and who later gave Duckworth's full name for the purpose of completing the necessary paperwork. The purchaser, ""Wayne"", told Mrs Shelley to transfer the registration of the vehicle to ""Fiona"" who was present. ""Fiona"" is the name of Duckworth's wife.

9Gale was interviewed in Queensland by NSW Police on 9 December 2006, and that interview was electronically recorded. He denied any involvement in the Nimbin offence. He agreed that he knew Duckworth as an acquaintance. He saw him, very occasionally, at a Coolangatta hotel at which Gale was employed. He said he had never been to Nimbin and did not know where it was. He said that he had been to Murwillumbah, with a man who he named, who was the owner of a hotel at Coolangatta. He had not been to Murwillumbah in the company of Duckworth. As of June 2006, he did not see Duckworth; previously he had seen him by chance with other friends. They spoke to one another on occasion by telephone. He could not explain the telephone contact between them shortly before and on 26 June.

10Significantly, Gale said that Duckworth did not tell him about having been robbed, although the subject might have come up in group conversation. (I say significantly because the evidence shows a considerable number of telephone contacts between the two on and about 26 June, when, it might be expected, Duckworth would have mentioned what he said were his experiences of that day.)

11Duckworth was interviewed by police at his home on 14 November 2006, and the interview electronically recorded (apparently by audio). He then gave a detailed account consistent with that he had earlier given, of what he said were the events of 26 June of that year. Inter alia, he said that he had not made or received any telephone calls while on his way to work or while he was at work on that day.

The coincidence evidence

12The coincidence evidence that the DPP seeks to adduce under s 98 of the Evidence Act concerns an event that took place in Queensland on 5 November 2006. An armed robbery was committed at a hotel called the Greenbank Park Ridge Tavern. At 1.25am on that day, two men, wearing balaclavas, dark clothes and plastic jackets entered the premises, one armed with an iron bar, one with a bicycle pump. Two female staff were present, as was the manager, Paul Carr. The intruders ordered the women to drop their handbags, and demanded to be shown where the office was. One of the women led the men towards the office, which Carr unlocked. One of the intruders shouted at one of the women and Carr to get on the ground. An object was forcibly pushed into the head of one of the women. The hands of the other woman were taped together. The intruders emptied the safe, taking about $63,000. As they left, one of the men threatened to kill the women if they rang anybody within ten minutes.

13The two intruders were Duckworth and Gale. The entire event was carried out by arrangement with Carr, who had, by a pre-arranged signal, let them know when to enter. The proceeds of the robbery were to be shared between the three men.

14Duckworth and Gale were arrested in Queensland and charged. Each was interviewed (Gale on 8 November and Duckworth on 9 November), and the interview recorded. Each entered a plea of guilty to the charge, and each was, on 11 April 2007, sentenced to a term of imprisonment. A ""Schedule of Property Offences"" (apparently the equivalent of what is commonly, in this jurisdiction, called a statement of agreed facts) was before the sentencing court, and was before the District Court and this Court. (It may be observed that this event demonstrates quite clearly the falsity of much of what was said by Gale in the recorded interview on 9 December, in which he professed only a slight acquaintance with Duckworth.)

15It was while serving the terms of imprisonment imposed in respect of this offence that Duckworth and Gale came into contact with the prison informer to whom I have referred above.

16On 21 July 2009, the Office of the DPP served on the legal representatives of each respondent a notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act, stating its intention to adduce tendency evidence. The notices contained the following:

""2. The Prosecution will seek to adduce evidence of criminal association between [the respondents] in the commission of an offence of armed robbery in company with personal violence to which they both pleaded guilty in the Brisbane District Court on 3 April 2007.""

17The substance of the tendency evidence proposed to be adduced was identified as the ""Property Offences Schedule"" which contained the facts alleged against the respondents in respect of the Park Ridge Tavern offence.

18On 28 February 2011, the Office of the DPP served on the legal representatives of each respondent a notice under s 98 of the Evidence Act, stating its intention of adducing coincidence evidence. Each notice contained the following:

""2. The two or more events which are the subject of the proposed evidence are: (1) The theft of money from the Nimbin Hotel on 26 June 2006, and (2) The theft of money from the Park Ridge Tavern on 5 November 2006.

3. The evidence is to be tendered to prove that [each respondent] did a particular act, namely he participated in the staged robbery of the Nimbin Hotel on 26 June 2006 and the staged robbery of the Park Ridge Tavern on 5 November 2006.""

In each notice the substance of the evidence proposed to be tendered as coincidence evidence was identified as the transcript of the proceedings before the District Court at Brisbane, and the transcripts of the records of interview of 8 and 9 November 2006. That is, the DPP proposed to use the evidence of each respondent's participation in the Park Ridge Tavern offence as coincidence evidence to prove his involvement in the theft of money from the Nimbin Hotel in June.

The District Court proceedings

19On 4 April 2011, the respondents were arraigned in the District Court at Lismore on an indictment alleging (against Duckworth) larceny as a clerk or servant, and (against Gale) larceny (of the Nimbin Hotel). Each entered a plea of not guilty. The purpose of the arraignment on that day was to confer jurisdiction on the court to deal with the question of admissibility of the evidence sought to be tendered by the DPP as coincidence evidence (see Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 130). Reliance on tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act was abandoned.

20The trial judge was provided with a considerable volume of material, being, essentially, the case the DPP proposed to make. Each party provided considered and helpful written submissions. On the following day, 5 April, counsel addressed orally. On that day the trial judge delivered judgment, rejecting the evidence.

21His Honour recounted the relevant facts and circumstances, and referred to two judgments of this Court: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 (concerning tendency evidence) and R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 (concerning coincidence evidence). He quoted from s 101(2) of the Evidence Act (to which I will come), and gave as his reasons for rejecting the evidence, the following:

""Well the introduction of a conviction of robbery of licensed premises is incontestably prejudicial. There is then a balancing exercise to be done and in my view the principles to which I have already referred about assessing whether or not things are probative namely on one extreme they only indicate one thing, on the other extreme they do not indicate very much, in the middle people might disagree about them, are relevant to doing the balancing exercise required by subs (2) of 101. I do not take the view that the probative value of the Queensland evidence substantially outweighs the undoubted prejudicial effect it would have on the accused and it is for that reason and acknowledging that it is an issue in my view upon which minds may differ that I rule against the Crown's application.""

It is against that ruling that the DPP now appeals.

22A decision to reject evidence tendered as coincidence evidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act is reviewable on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499: see DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63.

Coincidence evidence

23The admission of coincidence evidence in criminal cases is governed by two provisions of the Evidence Act, s 98 and s 101. Those sections are relevantly in the following terms:

""98 The coincidence rule
(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Note. One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) ... 

101 Further restrictions on ... coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section ... 98.

(2) ... coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution, cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) ...

(4) ...""

24By s 100(2), a court may dispense with the notice requirements of s 98(1)(b) by directing that, notwithstanding the failure of the party seeking to adduce the evidence to give notice, the coincidence rule is not to apply.

25At its heart, s 98 is a provision concerning the drawing of inferences. The purpose sought to be achieved by the tender of coincidence evidence is to provide the foundation upon which the tribunal of fact could draw an inference. The inference is that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. The process of reasoning from which that inference would be drawn is:


two or more events occurred; and 
there were similarities in those events; or there were similarities in the circumstances in which those events occurred; or there were similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred; and 
having regard to those similarities, it is improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally; 
therefore the person in question did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.

26What is important to recognise, in my opinion, is that this process of reasoning and the drawing of the inferences (that the person did the act or had the state of mind) is for the tribunal of fact: see DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9. Part of that process involves findings of fact. Did the two (or more) events occur? Were there relevant similarities? Where the party tendering the evidence relies upon a number of asserted similarities, the tribunal of fact must identify which, if any, of those similarities have been established. Before asking itself the penultimate question - is it improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally? - it must discard any asserted similarities not established. 

27The task for the judge in determining the admissibility of evidence that would permit the jury to undertake that reasoning process, and draw the ultimate inference, is what is presently in issue. Provided the evidence is such that would permit the jury, acting reasonably, to reach that conclusion or draw that inference, the evidence could be held to have significant probative value. It is a question of the capacity of the evidence to have that effect: DSJ at [8], [11], [55]. Subject to s 101, the evidence would, following that reasoning, be admissible. 

28Before the evidence can be admitted, however, two conditions must be met. The judge must:

(i) be satisfied that reasonable notice has been given; and

(ii) form the opinion that the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering the evidence, will have significant probative value.

29Section 98 is framed in the negative. It is, therefore, more accurate to say that it is a provision that prohibits the admission of evidence from which such an inference may be drawn unless the stated conditions are met. 

30The factual underpinnings of the s 98 decision to admit or reject coincidence evidence are:


that there is evidence capable of establishing the occurrence of two or more events; and 
that there is evidence capable of establishing similarities in the two or more events; or 
that there is evidence capable of establishing similarities in the circumstances in which two or more events occurred; 
that there is evidence capable of establishing both similarities in the two or more events and similarities in the circumstances in which the two events occurred. 

31In a case in which it is found that there is such evidence, then, in my opinion, the correct process in the determination of the admission of evidence under s 98 involves a series of steps, as follows:


the first step is to identify the ""particular act of a person"" or the ""particular state of mind of a person"" that the party tendering the evidence seeks to prove; 
the second step is to identify the ""two or more events"" from the occurrence of which the party tendering the evidence seeks to prove that the person in question did the ""particular act"" or had the ""particular state of mind""; 
the third step is to identify the ""similarities in the events"" and/or the ""similarities in the circumstances in which the events occurred"" by reason of which the party tendering the evidence asserts the improbability of coincidental occurrence of the events; 
the fourth step is to determine whether ""reasonable notice"" has been given of the intention to adduce the evidence (or, if reasonable notice has not been given, whether a direction under s 100(2) ought to be given, dispensing with the requirement); 
the fifth step is to make an evaluation whether the evidence will, either by itself or in conjunction with other evidence already given or anticipated, ""have significant probative value""; 
in a criminal proceeding, if it is determined that the evidence would have ""significant probative value"", the sixth step is the determination whether the probative value of the evidence ""substantially outweighs"" any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant (s 101(2)). 
the sixth step necessarily involves some analysis both of the probative value of the evidence in question and any prejudicial effect it might have: R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413, and a balancing of the two.

32It is quite clear that nothing approaching this process was undertaken by the trial judge. In effect, the respondents concede that error has been demonstrated in the House v The King sense, in the manner in which his Honour approached the task. That conclusion is correctly made. 

33By s 5F(5) of the Criminal Appeal Act, this Court may, if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling the subject of the appeal, make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling against which the appeal is brought. Error having been established, it will be necessary that this Court consider the issue afresh. One complication that has affected this appeal is that, from the beginning, it has been assumed that the same result will ensue in relation to each accused. That is not necessarily so. While, as things presently stand, the accused will be tried jointly, the case in respect of each must be examined separately.

34Applying the process set out above:

(i) the ""particular act"" the DPP seeks to prove against Gale is that, on 26 June 2006, he stole money from the Nimbin Hotel. On the case as the Crown seeks to prove that act, that involves proving that he:


was present at the Nimbin Hotel in the morning of 26 June 2006; 
in collusion with Duckworth, stole money from the Nimbin Hotel; 
travelled with Duckworth in Duckworth's car to Murwillumbah; 
left Duckworth on the side of the road, drove and then abandoned Duckworth's car;

the ""particular act"" the DPP seeks to prove against Duckworth is that, on 26 June 2006, he stole money from the Nimbin Hotel. On the case as the Crown seeks to prove that act, that involves proving that:


as manager/licensee of the Nimbin Hotel, he connived with Gale to create the appearance of a robbery; 
that Gale was present at the Nimbin Hotel in the morning of 26 June 2006; 
he drove his car, with Gale, to Murwillumbah; 
he falsely pretended to Mr Faust that he had been robbed at gunpoint, abducted, and abandoned on the roadside; 
he made a false report of robbery to police;

(ii) the ""two or more events"" the similarity of which the DPP contends proves that the respondents did those acts are the robbery at the Park Ridge Tavern (""Park Ridge Tavern event"") and the theft of money from the Nimbin Hotel (""the Nimbin Hotel event""). (There is no issue that money was stolen from the Nimbin Hotel. The questions concern the circumstances in which it was stolen, and, specifically, whether Gale was involved and whether Duckworth's undisputed involvement was criminal or innocent. The note to s 98(1) expressly confirms that one of the events in question may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding);

(iii) I will discuss below the asserted similarities in the two events and the circumstances in which they occurred. That is one of two central issues in the appeal;

(iv) no question of notice arises. It is not in issue that ""reasonable notice"" was given;

(v) there is little doubt, in my opinion, that evidence that, just five months after the Nimbin Hotel event, each respondent was involved in the Park Ridge Tavern event, which was a robbery committed by arrangement with the manager of that Tavern, would have significant probative value. (That is without any consideration of similarities other than the nature of the events and criminal involvement of the two respondents);

(vi) accordingly, the final, and central, question is whether the probative value of the evidence ""substantially outweighs"" its obvious prejudicial effect (s 101(2)). It is to be understood that the ""prejudicial effect"" of a particular item of evidence is the risk that a jury might, in some way, misuse it: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [92]; R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [72]-[73]; R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182 at [116]; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [56]; 201 A Crim R 451.

35Critical to the DPP's claim to adduce the coincidence evidence is the analysis of the similarities in the two events, or in the circumstances in which the two events occurred, that are asserted. In written submissions counsel for the DPP propounded these similarities as:

""53. The similarities between the Park Ridge Tavern robbery and the Nimbin Hotel robbery are:


the presence of Duckworth at both robberies; 
the presence of Gale at both robberies; 
that both robberies involved an 'insider' who was employed at the premises and facilitated the robbery. At the Nimbin Hotel it was Duckworth, at the Park Ridge Tavern it was Paul Carr; 
both robberies involved ex-police officers; 
both were robberies of licensed premises; 
both robberies occurred when the premises were closed; 
substantial amounts of money were stolen in both robberies - $36,781 from the Nimbin Hotel and approximately $60,000 from the Park Ridge Tavern; 
both robberies involved multiple participants, in the case of the Nimbin Hotel, two offenders, in the case of the Park Ridge Tavern, three offenders.""

36I note that the use of the term ""robbery"" in connection with the Nimbin event is inconsistent with what the DPP actually contends, which is that that was not a ""robbery"" at all, but rather a theft by Duckworth, with the assistance of Gale, of money, falsely represented as a robbery by an intruder.

37Some of the asserted similarities expose a serious logical fallacy in the argument. The presence of Gale at the Nimbin Hotel, the (criminal) involvement of an ""insider"" at the Nimbin Hotel, the involvement of ex-police officers (ie Duckworth and Gale) in each event, and involvement of multiple offenders at the Nimbin Hotel event are all, far from being established similarities (or similarities capable of being established), the very facts that the DPP seeks to prove by the coincidence evidence. This involves, in my opinion, a misunderstanding of the note to s 98. The note permits an ""event"" to be the subject of coincidence evidence, even where its occurrence is a fact in issue in the proceeding. The Crown cannot use the (asserted) presence of Gale at both events to prove that Gale was present at the Nimbin event. The argument is a classic instance of ""begging the question"" (properly so called). It assumes the very facts that the DPP seeks to prove. In my opinion, similarities for the purposes of s 98 must be capable of proof by means other than the ""facts"" sought to be established.

38Put another way: included in the facts that the DPP seeks to prove by the coincidence evidence (and of which it does not have other evidence other than that of the prison informer) are:


the presence of Gale at the Nimbin event (as at the Park Ridge Tavern event); 
that the Nimbin event, like the Park Ridge Tavern event, involved ""an insider"" who was at the hotel and who facilitated the ""robbery""; 
that the Nimbin event, like the Park Ridge Tavern event, involved multiple participants; 
the criminal involvement of Duckworth in the Nimbin event as perpetrator rather than victim.

Those ""facts"" (more accurately, assertions) cannot also be proffered as similarities used to prove that they are facts. They must therefore be excluded from the DPP's catalogue.

39That ""substantial amounts of money were stolen"" in the two events is, in the circumstances, irrelevant. The amount of money taken can only be a consequence of what the previous day's trade had yielded. No inference of the kind sought to be drawn could validly be drawn. 

40What is left of the DPP's list of ""similarities"" is:


the presence of Duckworth at both events; 
that both events involved licensed premises; 
that both events occurred when the premises were closed.

41In my opinion, for circumstances such as, for example, the presence of Gale at the Nimbin event, to be presented to a jury as a ""similarity"", it is necessary that the DPP adduce evidence independent of the coincidence evidence of that fact. So far as I can see in the material provided to this Court, the only evidence the DPP has to establish that ""fact"" is the evidence of the prison informer. By saying that, I do not mean to denigrate that evidence. Its probative value will be a matter for the jury.

42The evidence of telephone calls between Duckworth and Gale on 26 June 2006 does not go anywhere near placing Gale at the Nimbin Hotel; it is evidence from which a jury might infer that he was at Murwillumbah at the same time as Duckworth, and that he was, at the critical time, in communication with Duckworth. It is, I accept, potentially a significant circumstance in the circumstantial case against both respondents.

43Under the heading ""A Unique Factor"", the DPP went on to make this submission:

""54. The presence of Duckworth and Gale at both the robberies gives the two events a specific similarity which is highly probative in the context of coincidence reasoning. As with the poisoning cases [reference omitted] it is inherently improbable that Duckworth and Gale, who have admitted staging a robbery of one licensed premises, would be present, innocently involved, in another robbery of licensed premises in similar circumstances.""

This, again, ""begs the question"". It assumes one of the very facts sought to be proved - that Gale was present at the Nimbin Hotel at the time of the Nimbin event.

44That then raises the question: are the three (or four, if the evidence of the prison informer is accepted as establishing Gale's presence at the Nimbin event) remaining similarities, of which there is evidence independent of the coincidence evidence, capable of establishing the improbability that the Nimbin event and the Park Ridge Tavern event occurred coincidentally (ie without the criminal involvement of Duckworth and Gale at the Nimbin event). (In fact, the question must be asked and answered separately in respect of each.) If the answer is affirmative, I would conclude that the evidence (the proposed coincidence evidence) would have significant probative value. I have framed the question as I have (""capable of establishing"") because, in my opinion, as I have said above, it is for the jury to assess whether the facts asserted to be similarities are, indeed, ""facts""; if so, whether they do indeed establish the improbability of the coincidental occurrence of the events in question; and, finally, whether they do indeed prove the facts sought to be proved - that Duckworth and Gale were both present at the Nimbin Hotel on 26 June and stole the proceeds of the previous day's trading.

45This question must be answered in the light of the other circumstantial evidence to which I have referred above: importantly, that the two respondents had repeated telephone contact on the day of the Nimbin event, that the mobile telephone evidence suggests that both were present in Murwillumbah at a time relevant to when Duckworth claimed to have been abandoned and his car stolen; and Duckworth's later denial of having any telephone calls on his way to work on 26 June. In respect of this last proposition, it would be necessary to bear in mind that he was only questioned about that circumstance in November; it was a question that did not arise when he made his initial statement in June 2006. It might not be surprising if he did not recall the telephone calls (assuming that the Nimbin event occurred as he described it, and not as the DPP now contends). Also relevant in this assessment is the evidence of the prison informer. While there are always difficulties in evidence given by such a witness, and a jury would be required to be cautioned in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act, the reliability or potential weight of the evidence is not a relevant factor in the determination to admit or reject the evidence: see Shamouil.

46The three circumstances of similarity are, in this case, effectively common ground. They are the presence of Duckworth at both events, that each offence was committed on licensed premises, and that, in each case, the licensed premises were closed at the time. If the jury were to accept the evidence of the prison informer, that Gale had admitted to being present, that similarity could be added to the bundle of similarities from which the inference could, if the jury saw fit, be drawn against Duckworth.

47It may not always be the case that the similarities asserted are undisputed. A party tendering coincidence evidence may wish to rely on evidence of asserted similarity that is in contest. In that case, the jury would have to be directed that they could take into account those ""similarities"" that they found to be established. This exercise is analogous with the exercise undertaken in a case in which reliance is placed upon circumstantial evidence.

48In this case, if the coincidence evidence were to be admitted, the jury would be invited to reason as follows:


Duckworth was present when the Nimbin event occurred; 
the Nimbin event involved licensed premises; 
the Nimbin event occurred at a time when the licensed premises were closed; 
Duckworth was involved in the Park Ridge Tavern robbery; 
Gale was involved in the Park Ridge Tavern robbery; 
the Park Ridge Tavern event was a robbery of licensed premises; 
the Park Ridge Tavern robbery was committed when the premises were closed; 
the Park Ridge Tavern robbery was committed with the connivance of the manager; 
taken together, and in conjunction with the circumstantial evidence (especially the evidence of telephone calls between Duckworth and Gale on the day of the Nimbin event) the similarities render it improbable that the Nimbin event occurred coincidentally to the Park Ridge Tavern event; rather, it is probable that the common elements provide the basis for an inference that both Duckworth and Gale were criminally involved in the Nimbin event.

49In those circumstances, it is my opinion that the evidence is capable of having significant probative value (s 98). Section 101 raises a more difficult issue. Plainly, the coincidence evidence has substantial probative value. But it is also highly prejudicial. I am unable to conclude that the probative value substantially outweighs the potential prejudice.

50I would therefore dismiss the Crown appeal. The order I propose is:

The Crown appeal is dismissed.

51FULLERTON J: I agree with Simpson J.

2759896,Donohoe v R [2012] NSWCCA 176,"Judgment

 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.

 

2GARLING J: Stuart James Donohoe, the applicant, seeks an extension of time within which he ought be permitted to apply for leave to appeal against a decision of the District Court of NSW (McLoughlin DCJ) of 28 October 2011.

 

3The applicant had applied to the District Court by Notice of Motion dated 25 August 2011, for an order that he be granted leave to withdraw his plea of guilty to an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that:

 

""On 18 February 2010, at Bonny Hills in the State of New South Wales, in circumstances of aggravation, did break and enter the dwelling house of Jane Churcher at 1004 Ocean Drive, Bonny Hills, and therein did have sexual intercourse with Jane Churcher without the consent of Jane Churcher and knowing that she was not consenting.""

 

4The application to withdraw the guilty plea was heard on 9 September 2011, when the applicant gave evidence, as did his former solicitor, Mr Stephen Wright. The hearing was completed on 13 October 2011, when counsel made submissions.

 

5On 28 October 2011, McLoughlin DCJ delivered judgment. In that judgment he dismissed the motion and declined to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw his plea of guilty. That decision is the subject of this appeal.

 

6The substantive application before this Court is brought pursuant to the provisions of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

 

7In the absence of leave being granted to adduce fresh, additional or substituted evidence, an appeal under s 5F, including an application for leave to appeal, falls to be determined on the evidence given in the proceedings below: s 5F(4). That is the position in this application.

 

Proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal

8The application was heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 4 June 2012, at the conclusion of which, judgment was reserved.

 

9On 4 July 2012, the Court made the orders which are set out at the end of this judgment. I indicated then that it would publish its reasons as soon as was practicable.

 

10On 6 July 2012, the Supreme Court granted bail to the applicant. The grant of bail was a conditional one that required the applicant to appear in the District Court in August 2012, when the matter was next listed. It is unnecessary to record all of the conditions.

 

11These are my reasons for joining in with the making of the orders of the Court on 4 July 2012.

 

Extension of time within which to lodge an application for leave to appeal

12The applicant was obliged to seek leave to appeal by 11 November 2011. In fact, the application for leave to appeal was lodged on 22 December 2011. The reason proffered on behalf of the applicant, was that he had been given incorrect advice that it was inappropriate to appeal until after his sentenced had been imposed. He also supports this application by reference to the difficulties in providing instructions to his solicitors having regard to his being in custody on the North Coast.

 

13The Crown does not oppose the application for an extension of time. In the particular circumstances of this case, the application should be granted and time should be extended to enable the applicant to seek leave to appeal.

 

Procedural history

14The offence with which the applicant was charged is alleged to have occurred on 18 February 2010. Police spoke to the applicant in the course of that day, but he was not arrested at that time.

 

15About six months later, the police received results of a DNA analysis from the Division of Analytical Laboratories. On 13 August 2010, the applicant was arrested and charged with the offence upon which he was later indicted. He has been in custody since that time.

 

16The applicant's trial was listed for hearing on 2 May 2011, at Port Macquarie District Court.

 

17On that day the applicant was arraigned before Freeman DCJ, and upon arraignment, entered a plea of guilty.

 

18At the request of counsel for the applicant, without opposition from the Crown, the matter was stood over to 3 May 2011.

 

19On 3 May 2011, the Court was informed that as a Statement of Agreed Facts had still not been prepared and agreed to, it was necessary that the matter be stood over to the following day.

 

20On 4 May 2011, proceedings on sentence commenced in front of Freeman DCJ. A Statement of Agreed Facts and the applicant's criminal history record were tendered. An application was made by counsel for the applicant for the matter to be adjourned to a later time for sentence so as to enable the applicant to obtain a pre-sentence report from the Probation & Parole Service, and also a psychiatric report from Justice Health. The matter was adjourned to the sittings of the District Court at Port Macquarie, which were due to commence on 18 July 2011.

 

21A pre-sentence report dated 4 July 2011 was prepared by the Probation & Parole Service as was a report from Justice Health (Dr D Greenberg) dated 24 June 2011.

 

22The applicant appeared for sentence on 18 July 2011. At that point in time, an application to withdraw his plea of guilty was foreshadowed, and his then solicitor and counsel withdrew from the matter.

 

23On 26 August 2011, a notice of motion was placed before the Court seeking that leave be granted to allow the applicant to withdraw his plea of guilty.

 

24After the notice of motion was filed, it was adjourned until 9 September 2011 for hearing. On 9 September 2011 McLoughlin DCJ heard the matter and at the request of the parties, adjourned the matter to 13 October 2011 for the conclusion of oral submissions by counsel for the parties.

 

Judgment

25On 28 October 2011, McLoughlin DCJ delivered judgment orally.

 

26McLoughlin DCJ was satisfied of the following matters:

 

(a)the applicant had signed the Agreed Statement of Facts;

 

(b)the applicant had made admissions to a Probation & Parole officer;

 

(c)the applicant received advice from both his solicitor, Mr Wright, and his counsel, Mr Barnett, which was not erroneous, nor was it such as would affect the integrity of the plea of guilty;

 

(d)the advice he had received about tendency evidence was that it may well be admitted, and if it was admitted, that the Crown case against him was thereby strengthened and enhanced;

 

(e)the applicant knew the facts to which he was pleading guilty;

 

(f)the applicant knew and understood the offence to which he was pleading guilty and the nature and effect of it;

 

(g)the applicant had a reasonable period of time between receiving advice from his solicitor and counsel, and when he gave instructions to them to enter a plea of guilty.

 

27In finding these matters, his Honour rejected, in large part, the evidence of the applicant to the contrary. It seems that on all matters of contest between the applicant and his former solicitor, Mr Wright, his Honour has accepted the evidence of Mr Wright.

 

28Having found the facts to which attention has been drawn, his Honour considered a question of law which was whether particular evidence referred to in the judgment as the tendency evidence, would or would not have been admitted at the trial of the applicant. It is convenient to note here, at the outset, that before the District Court the Crown sought to tender this evidence on the basis that it was either or both tendency evidence or coincidence evidence. It will be easier to refer to this disputed evidence as ""tendency evidence"", but both bases for the admission need to be kept in mind.

 

29The question arose for his Honour's consideration because as the evidence of Mr Wright disclosed, it was Mr Wright's opinion that unless the Crown succeeded in having the tendency evidence admitted, there ""...wasn't a great deal at all ..."" of evidence in the Crown brief capable of establishing the applicant's guilt of the offence charged. During submissions in the District Court, the Crown accepted, without making any formal concessions, that without the tendency evidence, the Crown case was a weak one.

 

30It was also important because of the content of the legal advice given to the applicant, and upon which he relied when entering his plea of guilty.

 

31The Crown's case against the applicant was a circumstantial one. The complainant had not identified the applicant and there was no factual material that directly implicated the applicant as being the offender, nor was there any compelling evidence which placed the applicant at the scene of the crime. He did not know the complainant, and there was no apparent motive for the applicant to commit the offence.

 

32With respect to the tendency evidence, the trial Judge, in his judgment, addressed the legal test for the admissibility of the evidence, and made reference to some of the relevant authorities on that question. His Honour noted that counsel for the applicant submitted that the evidence would not have been admitted at trial. He rejected that view and said:

 

""I am of the view there may well be an argument that it should not be admitted, however I would not determine that it would not have been admitted on that day, nor at present.

 

Mr Evers also submits that there would be no risk of the discount being reduced because of the testing of the tendency evidence on a voir dire. Again, this is a matter of discretion for the trial judge and, if the evidence was tested by the cross-examination of complainants and that evidence allowed, there would be a real risk of a discount being diminished because of that effect.""

 

33His Honour returned to this subject later in his judgment and said this:

 

""The complaint [the applicant] makes through Mr Evers and in his evidence is that the advice given was in fact wrong. That the tendency evidence would not have been admitted and should witnesses have been challenged in the voir dire, there would have been no reduction to the percentage discount. 

 

I do not find either of those matters. It may be that the evidence could have been excluded and it may well have been preferable that the voir dire was taken, if it could have been done on the papers. However if it was not to be done on the papers, there was a real risk of the discount being reduced because of the complainants being required to give evidence and relive their ordeal.""

 

34His Honour concluded that on the factual material before him, and in light of his conclusion about the possible admission of the tendency evidence, the applicant had not established any basis for the withdrawal of his plea.

 

35His Honour noted these matters immediately prior to announcing his conclusion:

 

""I am not satisfied on balance that the applicant has demonstrated that the advice given by Mr Barnett and Mr Wright was such that it affects the integrity of the plea. 

 

The applicant knew the facts to which he was pleading guilty. He knew the offence, he knew that without the tendency evidence, there was a strong defence case. He had been told that the tendency evidence may well be admitted and if so, the Crown case was strengthened and enhanced.""

 

Test to be applied under s 5F

36The decision below was one which involved a weighing up of a number of factual and other circumstances, an evaluation of them and the state of mind of the applicant at the time the plea was entered, and ultimately the exercise of a discretion as to whether or not leave ought be granted to the applicant to withdrawn his plea.

 

37This Court ought not interfere with such a decision, unless it is satisfied, in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, that the exercise of the discretion by the trial judge has miscarried.

 

Grounds of appeal

38The applicant advances four grounds of appeal. They are:

 

(1)His Honour erred in assessing the admissibility of the tendency evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown at the trial when considering whether to grant the relief sought by the applicant.

 

(2)His Honour erred in failing to consider the evidence to be led at trial in assessing the appropriateness of the advice provided to the appellant by his legal representatives.

 

(3)His Honour erred in failing to make findings as to what advice was provided to Mr Donohoe and what effect that advice had on Mr Donohoe's decision to enter a guilty plea.

 

(4)His Honour erred in refusing to grant leave to withdraw the guilty plea.

 

39In support of each of these grounds, which it will be necessary to analyse, the applicant submitted that his Honour should have, but did not, address three matters in considering whether or not to grant the application, namely:

 

(a)was the legal advice given imprudent and inappropriate;

 

(b)was the plea of guilty attributable to a consciousness of guilt;

 

(c)was there a real question about the guilt of the applicant;

 

see R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97; (2001) 122 A Crim R 310 per Wood CJ at CL at [20].

 

40Spigelman CJ in R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; 121 A Crim R 472 at [33], cited with approval, this passage of Badgery-Parker J in R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481:

 

""If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction and to order a new trial.""

 

41But in considering an application of this kind, a Court of Criminal Appeal must exercise circumspection. In R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120, Kirby P observed at [122]:

 

""For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea, with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts, is normally to be take be admission by that person of the necessary ingredients of the offence: see O'Neill [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; Sagiv at 81.""

 

A Central Question

42Here, the principal submission which is made, and which is central to each ground of appeal, is whether the legal advice that the applicant received about the admissibility of the tendency evidence was correct or not.

 

43In order to understand whether the legal advice was correct, it is necessary to examine the basis upon which the Crown asserted that the tendency evidence was admissible, and to reach a conclusion about the fate of the evidence if it was tendered.

 

44The Crown served requisite notices under the Evidence Act 1995 which indicated that it proposed to rely upon either s 97 (tendency evidence) or s 98 (coincidence evidence) or both, in order to tender evidence of facts which underlay two previous convictions of the appellant. The conduct occurred in 2002 and 2006, as a result of which the appellant was sentenced for offences relating to his unauthorised entry into premises of female victims, whom he sexually or indecently assaulted.

 

45It was said by the Crown that the evidence was being tendered to prove in respect of the 2010 offence, that the applicant had a tendency to act in a particular way, namely to break into the complainant's house at night and have non-consensual sexual intercourse with her whilst she is in bed asleep.

 

46The last, and most specific of the notices, which was dated 20 April 2011, from the Crown about the tendency and coincidence evidence, was referred to at length in the appellant's submissions. It provided the following particulars of the relevant conduct:

 

(1)On each occasion there was a breaking.

 

(2)On each occasion the breaking occurred after midnight and before sunrise.

 

(3)Each of the dwellings broken into was within walking distance of the accused's then place of residence.

 

(4)On each occasion there was an element of stealth in the breaking in as much as none of the sleeping occupants of the dwelling was awakened.

 

(5)The accused prepared for his exit by opening necessary doors.

 

(6)The accused without waking any person in the dwelling (by stealth) entered the sleeping complainant's bedroom.

 

(7)In relation to the current incident and the 2005 incident the accused undressed.

 

(8)On each occasion the accused attacked the complainant whilst she was asleep in her bed in her own home.

 

(9)On each occasion the touching of the complainant by the accused is what awakens her.

 

(10)Nothing is stolen.

 

(11)No violence beyond the touching complained of occurs in each incident.

 

(12)When the accused is discovered, he does not threaten the complainant, but rather leaves via the prepared route.

 

(13)The victim is not acquainted with the accused.

 

47Section 97 of the Evidence Act forbids the admission of tendency evidence unless

 

""... the Court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.""

 

48Section 98 of the Evidence Act, which deals with coincidence evidence, has a similar restriction on its admissibility.

 

49Thus, whether the evidence in question amounts either to tendency or coincidence evidence, the Court has to be satisfied that the evidence has significant probative value. In the context of the charge in this case, the evidence could only have significant probative value, if it was capable of identifying the applicant as the person responsible for the offence.

 

50Because the tendency evidence was being relied upon by the Crown to establish the identity of the attacker as being the applicant, in determining whether the evidence, in fact, had significant probative value, it was necessary for McLoughlin DCJ to keep in mind what this Court said in R v O'Keefe [2009] NSWCCA 121 at [59]:

 

""... If the tendency identified stood alone in identifying the [applicant] as the offender ... it would have to be sufficiently peculiar or singular to amount to what has been described as a 'hallmark' or 'signature' of the [applicant] such that it would offend common sense to exclude it."" 

 

per Howie J (McColl JA and Grove J agreeing).

 

51In assessing the evidence as tendency evidence, a trial Judge is engaged in a multi-step process. The first step is to determine the relevance of the evidence: s 56 Evidence Act (Cth). The next step is that an assessment needs to be made of the extent to which the evidence in question has the capacity to rationally affect the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. The third step, assuming the evidence has the requisite capacity, is for the trial judge to make a further assessment, and prediction of the probative value that the jury might ascribe to the evidence. This step assumes that the jury will accept the evidence: DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 259 FLR 262 at [56] per Whealy JA; R v Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55; (2008) 182 A Crim R 302 at [33].

 

52There is then a further step, which is required by s 101(2) of the Evidence Act, namely that the evidence cannot be used unless

 

""... the probative value of evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant""

 

R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700.

 

53The test to be applied is whether the admission of the evidence involves a risk of an unfair trial: R v RM [2005] NSWCCA 413; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; (2009) 201 A Crim R 451 at [58]. As McHugh J said in Pfenning v R [1995] HCA 7; (1995) 182 CLR 461 at [40]:

 

""The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adding all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial"".

 

54It is only after an assessment has been made by a trial Judge of each of these matters and in accordance with the appropriate legal principle, that tendency evidence can be, or be said to be, admitted.

 

55It is obvious that in order to undertake such an assessment that two factors must be kept in mind. The first is that the precise identification of the fact in issue is ordinarily integral to the process. Unless the trial Judge knows what the fact in issue is, it is not feasible to make the necessary assessments: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) A Crim R 308 per Simpson J.

 

56The second matter which must be kept in mind is that the more general the tendency evidence relied upon is, then the less likely it is to have sufficient probative value to outweigh the prejudicial effect arising from tendency and coincidence evidence generally: R v O'Keefe at [60] per Howie J (McColl JA and Grove J agreeing).

 

57It is necessary to analyse the proposed tendency evidence with these principles in mind. The fact in issue in this case was the identity of the applicant as the offender. The points relied upon by the Crown, which have been set out in [46] above, assuming that they all apply in the index offence, are of some generality.

 

58For example, the fact that there was a breaking and entering by stealth and without waking any occupants, at a time between midnight and dawn, are facts of such generality that they do not, in my view, demonstrate a tendency or coincidence towards the fact in issue. The fact that the victim is not acquainted with the attacker is itself not at all remarkable. A significant number of offences of the relevant kind occur in circumstances where the offender and the victim are unknown to each other.

 

59None of the contentions set out in [46] seems to me to fall within the description given by Howie J in O'Keefe. None of these features, either alone or in combination, is peculiar or singular, nor do any of them give rise to what could be described as a ""hallmark"" or ""signature"" of an identified individual.

 

60As well, even if there was some probative value, there is significant prejudicial value in evidence giving rise to two previous convictions being put before a jury which is being asked to consider the guilt of the applicant of a third offence. The fact that a person has previously been convicted of two broadly similar offences is a prejudicial fact to be put before a jury. It may unfairly distract the jury from considering by reference to the relevant onus, the guilt or innocence of the offender of the offence charged on the indictment before them. Ordinarily, for that reason, evidence of previous convictions is not admissible.

 

61In all of those circumstances, and having regard to the whole of the process that must be undertaken by a trial Judge including the ultimate balancing process, my conclusion is that it is highly unlikely that the evidence sought to be tendered by the Crown would be admitted at any trial of the applicant.

 

62Such a conclusion is necessarily a predictive one. That is because the exercise contemplated by s 97 (and s 98) of the Evidence Act is a predictive and evaluative one, and is not a scientific one with a clear or rigid answer. On occasions, reasonable minds might differ with respect to admissibility: Fletcher at [35].

 

63However, in this case, I do not regard the central question as to admissibility as being finely balanced. On the contrary, for the reasons expressed above, I have concluded that it is highly unlikely that such evidence would be admitted at a trial.

 

64The trial Judge did not reach a similar conclusion about the admissibility of the evidence. His conclusion was that it could be that the evidence may have been excluded. This expresses as a mere possibility, which I have concluded as being highly unlikely. His Honour fell into error in expressing his conclusion as he did.

 

The Legal Advice

65As has been noted above at [27], McLoughlin DCJ accepted the evidence of Mr Wright, the applicant's solicitor, rather than the evidence of the applicant. No complaints have been, nor can they be, made with respect to this preference. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine Mr Wright's evidence, to identify with some precision what the advice was that was given by Mr Barnett of counsel. It was the principal relevant advice.

 

66Paragraph 24 of Mr Wright's affidavit of 1 September 2011, referred briefly to Mr Barnett's advice. It said:

 

""The advice from counsel was that 'we could run the voir dere [sic] but if we fail and the evidence is admitted there is a much greater chance of a guilty verdict and you then lose the value of an early plea'. Counsel was merely outlining the worst possible scenario. When the deponent understood those issues he agreed to the facts as presented of his own volition.""

 

67In the course of his evidence, some more details of Mr Barnett's advice were elicited. The evidence appears in a number of separate parts of the transcript. It is appropriate to set out here the relevant parts. At T17.13, (9 September 2011) Mr Wright said:

 

""And we told him that the way the case was going to be presented, particularly if the tendency evidence is admitted, then the case would become difficult for him and it was my advice that as his solicitor, I wouldn't take that risk. And the other thing I advised him as well, was that if that evidence did get admitted, then the trial would begin and he would lose the benefit of a plea, which he understood as well and he conveyed to me his reaction was, well if that evidence is admitted, they weren't his words, but if that gets in, such is life. ...""

 

68At T28.4, Mr Wright gave further evidence on this topic. He said:

 

""Q. And are you able to say what advice he was - he gave Mr Donohoe?

A. Yes, Mr Barnett concentrated on three aspects of the case, the fact that the alibi did not exist; that the DNA evidence did not eliminate my client; and that the tendency coincidence evidence, particularly the statements of the previous victims, was very compelling, but 'compelling' may not have been the word he used.

 

Q. But that was the effect of the words he used?

A. Mm.

 

Q. So, the effect of what he was saying was the tendency and coincidence evidence would have been admitted in his trial?

A. No, no, no, he said that if it did get admitted into his trial then it would represent an overwhelming case.

 

Q. Did Mr Donohoe --

A. Prosecution case.

 

Q. -- ask Mr Barnett, in your presence, what were the prospect of that evidence being admitted into his trial?

A. He did.

 

Q. And what was Mr Barnett's response?

A. Strong, a strong chance of that material being admitted to the case."" 

 

69In light of this evidence, and the content of the advice from Mr Barnett that there was a ""strong chance"" of the tendency evidence being admitted at a trial, it is unsurprising that the applicant's evidence in his affidavit was:

 

""[31] ... My understanding from what [Mr Barnett] was telling me was that the Judge would be likely to let the prosecution rely on tendency evidence, and that I would likely lose at trial.""

 

70The trial Judge recorded accurately and accepted that Mr Barnett's advice was that there was a strong change of the tendency evidence being admitted. He rejected the submissions of the applicant's counsel that this advice was erroneous, and said:

 

""It may be that the evidence could have been excluded ... I am not satisfied that ... the advice given by Mr Barnett and Mr Wright was such that it affects the integrity of the plea.""

 

71In light of my conclusions, which I have earlier expressed, that it is highly unlikely that the tendency evidence would be admitted, then the advice given by Mr Barnett, which was to the opposite effect, was erroneous and inappropriate. Because that advice was delivered in a way which coupled counsel's view as to the admissibility of the evidence, with his view as to likely consequences if the evidence was admitted, I am satisfied that the erroneous and inappropriate advice must have affected the integrity of the plea of guilty entered by the applicant.

 

Is there an error in McLoughlin DCJ's judgment?

72It is necessary, before this Court interferes with the exercise of a discretion, which undoubtedly McLoughlin DCJ was exercising in this case, for there to be an error identified of the kind described in House v The King.

 

73His Honour's conclusion was that the evidence may be admitted and that he did not need to determine whether it would or would not be admitted. He also concluded that counsel's advice was appropriate.

 

74His Honour's conclusion does not seem to have involved a consideration of each of the steps leading to a determination of whether the evidence would be admissible, to which I have earlier referred. This is hardly surprising. The trial Judge was not directly reminded of these steps by counsel. His Honour was not reminded of the requirements of s 101 of the Evidence Act to undertake an ultimate balancing exercise. His Honour was conducting a busy circuit. It is appropriate here to again note that it is counsel's duty to ensure that the presiding judge is provided with all appropriate assistance.

 

75His Honour did not consider, as a separate issue, whether even if there was a possibility of the tendency evidence being admitted, the provisions of s 101(2) of the Evidence Act, having regard to the fact that the evidence would undoubtedly reveal the previous convictions of the applicant, would have resulted in the balance falling in favour of the applicant and the evidence being excluded, or some other result.

 

76As I have earlier said, his Honour was in error with respect to his view about the admissibility of the tendency evidence.

 

77It follows from the conclusion that I have expressed above, that his Honour's conclusion that the advice given by counsel was appropriate, was also in error, and that the erroneous and inappropriate advice affected the integrity of the plea.

 

78In light of these conclusions, it is appropriate to separately, but briefly, consider each of the grounds of appeal.

 

Ground 1 - Admissibility of the tendency evidence

79The applicant challenges his Honour's conclusion about the admissibility of the tendency evidence. He submits that his Honour erred in concluding, as he did, that it may be that the evidence could have been excluded.

 

80For the reasons which I have earlier discussed, his Honour's conclusion was in error and it follows that this ground succeeds.

 

Ground 2 -Appropriateness of the legal advice

81Ground 2 asserts error in respect to the conclusion about the appropriateness of the advice provided.

 

82For the reasons that I have earlier expressed, the legal advice provided to the applicant was not appropriate.

 

83This Ground succeeds.

 

Ground 3 - Content and effect of Advice

84Ground 3 asserts error in failing to make findings as to what advice was provided to the applicant and what effect that advice had on his decision to enter a guilty plea.

 

85His Honour identified the advice that was in fact given. He found that he preferred the evidence of Mr Wright as to what had been said and that in substance the advice that he had received about the tendency evidence, was that there was a strong chance that it would be admitted, and if it was admitted, that the Crown case against the applicant was thereby strengthened and enhanced.

 

86This conclusion as to the content of the advice given to the applicant was one which was open on the evidence, and substantially accorded with the evidence that Mr Wright gave. There is no error demonstrated with respect to the advice, which the trial Judge found.

 

87It is also argued under Ground 3, that the trial Judge did not make any finding about what effect the advice had on the applicant's decision to enter a guilty plea.

 

88However, his Honour did find that the advice was taken into account by the applicant. He concluded that the advice, having regard to the other matters, did not affect the integrity of the plea. This finding, which has been set out at [35] above, demonstrates contrary to the applicant's argument, that in fact the trial Judge did consider the effect of the advice on the entry of the plea.

 

89I would not uphold Ground 3.

 

Ground 4 - Error in refusing to grant leave to withdraw plea

90Ground 4 raises a question as to whether his Honour was in error in refusing to grant leave to withdraw the guilty plea.

 

91In light of the fact that I am persuaded that Grounds 1 and 2 should be upheld, and that the errors disclosed go to a central question of a consideration of whether the guilty plea should have been permitted to be withdrawn, it follows that his Honour's exercise of his discretion was erroneous and it is a matter for this Court to exercise the discretion afresh.

 

92In light of these conclusions, there is no need to further consider this Ground.

 

Should the plea be allowed to be withdrawn?

93In my opinion, for the reasons that I have expressed above, it is highly unlikely that the tendency evidence would be admitted at trial.

 

94The Crown case at trial, in the absence of that evidence, is properly to be assessed as not a strong case against the applicant. There is undoubtedly a strong case that the complainant was assaulted. The issue is whether the person responsible for that assault was the applicant. The description given by the complainant does not readily fit that of the applicant. There is no other material that independently establishes that the applicant was at the scene of the crime. The DNA evidence is not of sufficient probative value to establish that fact.

 

95In the course of submissions before McLoughlin DCJ, the solicitor for the Crown informed his Honour that if the tendency evidence was not admitted it would significantly weaken the Crown case, and further, that it was his ""feeling"" that without that evidence, there would be insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction. He made no formal concession to that effect.

 

96The tendency evidence was necessary in the Crown's case, to identify the applicant as the person responsible for the assault. If it is not admitted, there is a real prospect that a jury would not be persuaded that the applicant should be convicted.

 

97Ordinarily, where a person accused of an offence has a reasonably arguable defence or there is some doubt about the strength of the Crown case, the interests of justice would compel a conclusion that the accused person ought have the opportunity to have a trial so as to hear the Crown's case, and hence leave ought be granted to withdraw a plea of guilty to enable a trial to take place.

 

98However, in this case, telling against the granting of that leave is the fact that the applicant did in fact enter the plea, and did so after signing the Statement of Facts. By signing the Statement of Facts, the applicant was apparently acknowledging the correctness of them. As well, the applicant apparently admitted his guilt when interviewed after his guilty plea.

 

99The question is therefore whether the plea of guilty is attributable to a consciousness of guilt, or else is a genuine recognition of the applicant's guilt.

 

100There can be little doubt, as his Honour found, that the applicant knew the elements of the offence to which he was pleading guilty. His Honour concluded, as it was open to him to do, that by signing the Statement of Agreed Facts, the applicant knew of those facts to which he was pleading guilty.

 

101The applicant's evidence was, in substance, that his plea of guilty was entered out of concern for the consequences of a conviction, and in an attempt to ensure that he had access to a real and identifiable discount for his plea of guilty. He said, in effect, that at no time did he genuinely intend to admit his guilt. He did so simply in recognition of what he thought was the likely outcome.

 

102Mr Wright, the applicant's former solicitor, confirmed in his evidence the following:

 

(a)that at all times up until after he received advice from counsel, the applicant had maintained to him that he had not committed the offence;

 

(b)the first occasion upon which Mr Wright advised the applicant about the precise nature of the tendency evidence was on 2 May 2011, which was the first day he was brought to court for the purpose of his trial, and the day upon which his plea of guilty was entered; and

 

(c)the applicant was not happy about the advice he was receiving and the course he was taking, and having to inform his mother of that change of plea.

 

103The Probation and Parole Service Report dated 18 July 2011 included the following:

 

""When questioned in regards to the offences, Mr Donohoe denies some of the agreed Statement of Facts. He admitted to being under the influence of alcohol and cannabis at the time of the offence, however, maintains there was no sexual intent; his initial intention was to break in to steal money. He claims that he plead guilty so as to avoid the victim having to attend court.""

 

104Mr Donohoe stated he was remorseful and empathetic to the victim, citing it as a ""spur of the moment act"", and was ashamed of his behaviour.

 

105However, Mr Donohoe continued to place the blame for committing the offences on his alcohol, drug and relationship issues. He stated he knew what he was doing

 

""was wrong and did not see it as a sexual act but more as a release from his current situation"".

 

106There is some difficulty with the accuracy of this ""admission"". The description given by the victim of what in fact was done to her, could not be interpreted as conduct which revealed anything other than a clear sexual intent. The attacker had removed his clothes and was sexually assaulting the victim. It was not a chance encounter. Nor is there any evidence that any attempt was made to steal any money, or that there was money available to be stolen.

 

107In the report of 24 June 2011 from Justice Health (Professor Greenberg), the following is contained:

 

""With regard to the offences he acknowledges he touched the victim's vagina with his fingers while she was asleep in bed but states that he thought he wasn't doing any harm. He acknowledges that he has previously been convicted of a sexual offence but stated there was no sexual element to this behaviour.""

 

108This description of the criminality involved in the sexual assault is completely at odds with the content of the victim's complaint. The victim complained that she was sexually assaulted by an attacker who, whilst naked, was engaged in oral vaginal intercourse. This was followed by quite a violent struggle during which the attacker continued to attempt to sexually assault her.

 

109The admissions to the Probation and Parole Service and Justice Health, do not of themselves recount any facts which suggest a familiarity with the Agreed Statement of Facts and the events in question. I do not regard these admissions as being a genuine confession of guilt. They reflect an attempt by the applicant to provide the information that he thought necessary for the purpose of obtaining a favourable report to assist with the sentencing process.

 

110There is no doubt that the applicant was advised that if he was to enter a plea of guilty, that he might expect a discount on any sentence. Having regard to his previous criminal history, he no doubt well understood this fact.

 

111In an affidavit sworn as part of his evidence before the District Court, the applicant said this:

 

""I was taken back down to the cells and a short time later Mr Wright came down to speak to me. I said to him 'I am not guilty, why did I do this?' He said, 'It's too late now, it's done'. ""

 

112Mr Wright refuted this evidence in his affidavit, asserting that the applicant had ""... agreed to the facts as presented of his own volition"".

 

113The trial Judge accepted the evidence of Mr Wright in preference to that of the applicant. Since I have seen neither Mr Wright nor the applicant give that evidence, there is no basis upon which it can be said that that finding by the trial Judge was erroneous.

 

114However, it is clear that within a short time after the entry of the plea of guilty, the applicant sought to make contact with alternative legal advisors and when the matter was next before the Court, the applicant's withdrawal of the plea was foreshadowed. In other words, he, at the first available time the matter was next before the Court, indicated that he wished to withdraw his plea, as it did not reflect any consciousness of guilt.

 

115In assessing whether the applicant's plea reflected a genuine consciousness of guilt, it is necessary to consider the context in which he gave the instructions. What he was being told was that the tendency evidence was likely to be admitted and, as a consequence, he would be convicted. His choice to plead guilty was made immediately after that advice was given and the plea was entered before the Statement of Facts was agreed.

 

116In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the plea reflected the advice he was given, rather than any genuine consciousness of guilt. His agreement to the Statement of Facts was a step in the process necessary to give effect to his plea.

 

117Having regard to the evidence which was before the trial Judge, and the circumstances of the advice which he received, I cannot be satisfied that the plea of guilty was in fact entered with any genuine consciousness of guilt. It was entered, so it seems to me, based upon erroneous advice for the purpose of achieving a shorter sentence.

 

118In all of those circumstances, I am satisfied, in accordance with the authorities, that the advice the applicant received was not appropriate, the entry of the plea of guilty did not reflect a genuine consciousness of guilt, and the applicant ought be permitted to withdraw his plea.

 

Conclusion

119In all of the circumstances, I am of the view that the applicant should have been granted leave to withdraw his plea, and orders should now be made to give effect to that conclusion.

 

Orders

120It was for these reasons that I proposed the making of the following orders, which the Court made on 4 July 2012:

 

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

 

(2)Appeal upheld.

 

(3)Set aside the order of the District Court of NSW (McLoughlin DCJ) dated 28 October 2011.

 

(4)In lieu thereof, grant leave to the applicant to withdraw his plea of guilty entered on 2 May 2011 to the offence.

 

121ADAMSON J: I agree with Garling J.

2759905,Castagna v R [2012] NSWCCA 181,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J. In particular having myself reviewed all of the relevant evidence I do not doubt that the appellant was rightly convicted.

2LATHAM J : The appellant was found guilty by a jury on 10 September 2009 of three offences, namely, (Count 1) supply not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), (Count 2) supply a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) and (Count 3) possess money being the proceeds of crime ($129,650). 

3The appellant appeals against his conviction on counts 1 and 2 on the basis that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. An additional ground in relation to count 2 alleges error in the trial judge's refusal to separate count 2 from count 1, error in refusing to direct a verdict in respect of count 2, and error in directing the jury that the presence of methylamphetamine in a wardrobe in the appellant's home (the subject of count 2) was capable of supporting the evidence of the principal Crown witness (Dow). There is no appeal against conviction in respect of count 3 and there is no appeal against sentence.

4In summary, the Crown case consisted of the evidence of a Mr Dow, a flight attendant, who was allegedly instructed by the appellant to transport amounts of methylamphetamine from Sydney to Perth and to remit amounts of money in payment for the drugs from Perth to Sydney by way of return flights. Count 1 alleged the supply by the appellant between 1 June 2004 and 12 April 2006 of more than a large commercial quantity (more than 1kg) of methylamphetamine, of which 1.9 kg was supplied on 11 April 2006 in a blue bag, which Dow took to Perth. Count 2 alleged that the appellant possessed for supply a quantity of methylamphetamine found in a wardrobe in a spare bedroom of the appellant's home following his arrest on 12 April 2006. 

The Evidence at Trial.

5Anthony Dow was a flight attendant with Qantas. In April 2006 he was living at 79 Francis St Bondi. He had previously lived in Old South Head Road, Rose Bay. The appellant and Mr Dow's wife had been friends for some period of time.

6On Friday, 7 April 2006 Mr Dow was on holidays. He was ill and at home when he received a phone call from the appellant asking him where he was. Telephone records produced at trial demonstrated that a phone call was made by the appellant to Mr Dow's mobile number at about 12:36 pm from a public payphone in Francis Street Bondi.

Supply of More than a Large Commercial Quantity of Methylamphetamine (Count 1).

7About 10 to 20 minutes later, the appellant and Mr Lee Pereira arrived at Mr Dow's home and went inside. The appellant had a blue bag from which he removed a vacuum sealed package containing a white substance and bundles of $50 and $100 notes. The appellant asked Mr Dow when he was going to Perth again. The appellant wanted Mr Dow to go to Perth that weekend, however Mr Dow declined because he was ill. He agreed to go to Perth on Tuesday.

8Mr Dow told the appellant that a training supplement which the appellant had requested from Mr Dow was in Mr Dow's bedroom. The appellant and Mr Pereira left Mr Dow in the living room and later left the house. The appellant took the blue bag with him when he left the living room. 

9Dow denied the suggestion that the appellant had left wedding invitations with him to be given to Dow's wife so that she could provide the addresses of their friends for the appellant's pending wedding celebrations.

10Det Hawkins was carrying out surveillance in Francis Street Bondi on 7 April 2006. At 12:33 pm he saw the appellant and Pereira stop and park in the street. The appellant walked to the front gate of the units at 79 Francis St, returned to his vehicle, then walked back to the building with a long white round object in his hand. He returned once more to the vehicle, then walked from the vehicle to the building with a small blue sports bag. At 12:41 pm detective Hawkins saw the appellant and Pereira leave the building and return to the vehicle.

11Later that afternoon, Mr Dow went to a medical centre at Bondi Junction where he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics. On Saturday his condition worsened and he went to Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick where he stayed overnight. On Sunday he went home and stayed there during the day.

12On Monday 10 April 2006, Dow went to lunch with his wife and a friend at Bondi Beach. On his return to his home that afternoon, he noticed the blue bag behind the sliding mirror door of his bedroom cupboard. He was surprised to find the bag in his cupboard, given that the appellant had not told him that he had placed it there. He shared the bedroom with his wife and his wife's daughter lived in the house with them. Dow went upstairs to the attic to his computer to check Qantas flights from Sydney to Perth. He was unable to get access to the web site.

13Later that night, the appellant and Pereira returned to 79 Francis St. The appellant said he wanted to talk to Dow. The appellant grabbed Dow by the shirt and told him to ""just fucking do it"". The appellant, Pereira and Dow went to the attic where Dow tried once again to access the Qantas website. The appellant gave Dow the flight number of the flight which the appellant was taking to Perth the following day. The appellant also produced an address for delivery of the blue bag. Dow wrote the street address (Roscorla Ave) on a business card that he had kept from the doctor at Bondi Junction medical centre. He incorrectly wrote the address and was corrected by the appellant (although the copy of the business card produced at trial appeared uncorrected). The appellant told Dow that he would tell him the suburb in Perth at the airport the following day.

14Dow initially told police after his arrest that he had gone to the address in Roscorla Avenue to see a girl and that he did not recognize the writing on the rear of the doctor's business card that was found in his possession. When interviewed by police on 11 April, Dow told them that he had written the address down the previous week, not the previous day. He also told police that the drugs were given to him ""last night"", whereas his evidence at trial suggested that the appellant brought the blue bag and left it in Dow's bedroom cupboard on 7 April.

15Pereira gave Dow a white Nokia phone (the number ending in 491) and the appellant told Dow he would call him using that phone after he had delivered the drugs. (The phone number was subscribed to a Sam Li of 222 Pitt St, Sydney. No records existed of that person at that address. The phone was in Dow's possession when he was arrested.) Pereira and the appellant left. Dow then booked the flight to Perth.

16Dow admitted that soon after the appellant left on 10 April, after allegedly threatening him, Dow called a friend in relation to the appellant's pending wedding. Dow's explanation for this apparent inconsistent conduct was that the appellant asked him to make the call. Dow admitted that there had been a conversation about the appellant's wedding.

17An Australian Crime Commission officer conducting surveillance on 79 Francis St on 10 April 2006 saw the appellant and Pereira arrive by car and enter those premises at 8:38 pm. He saw them leave the premises at 8:58 pm. The premises were not under surveillance between 6:30 pm and 7:20 pm that night.

18Detective Senior Constable Hawkins confirmed that there was no surveillance conducted on Dow or on 79 Francis St between 9:10 pm on 10 April and 6:50 am on 11 April 2006.

19On the morning of that day, Dow strapped the drugs from the blue bag around his waist using masking tape. He maintained at trial that this was his idea, albeit he later told police that he had been instructed to adopt that method. The money that he had previously seen in the blue bag was no longer there. The drugs were in a white powdery crystalline form in a see-through vacuum sealed plastic bag. He took the blue bag with him in his carry-on bag, together with runners and the white Nokia phone.

20Dow travelled to the airport, went through security and then went to the male toilets where he took the drugs and placed them in the blue bag, which he placed in turn inside the carry-on bag. He sat down in the staff travel area. The appellant walked in front of him and then sat down behind him, before whispering ""Yokine"", the suburb in Perth where the drugs were to be delivered.

21Detective Senior Constable Robison saw the appellant look at and smile at Dow at about 7:58 am at gates 6/7 of the Qantas domestic terminal. He saw the appellant sit in the row of seats behind Dow in the lounge area. Dow turned and appeared to have a conversation with the appellant. The appellant then stood up and walked in front of Dow, where both appeared to be having a conversation.

22Dow arrived in Perth and got a taxi to the Yokine address. Dow asked the driver to wait. He took the blue bag out of his carry-on bag and walked to the garage of the middle town house, opened the garage door, placed the blue bag inside and returned to the taxi. He then returned to the airport where he was arrested at about midday. He was about to fly from Perth to Melbourne because it was easier to get standby tickets on that route. Dow denied that he was going to Melbourne to report to whomever had given him the drugs.

23The taxi driver, Mr Sinagra, stated that when they arrived at the Yokine address, Dow said ""I'm not sure of the number, but I know the place"". The taxi driver confirmed that Dow took a bag and went to the second of the three units. After a few minutes he came back without the bag.

24Shortly after Dow's departure from Roscorla Ave, To Tan Pham was seen to approach the townhouse. This man was known to the appellant, who was in his company when a vehicle was stopped by police in Perth on 7 March 2005.

25Sergeant Anderson conducted a search of the garage at 6A Roscorla Ave Yokine at 1:20 pm. He saw a blue sports bag sitting on top of a stack of boxes just inside the garage door. Inside the blue bag was a white crystalline substance inside a red plastic bag. When shown the video of the search of the garage in the course of his evidence, Dow said that he had no memory of the red bag. Dow's DNA was later found on the masking tape that secured the drugs. There was no DNA or fingerprint evidence that linked the appellant with the blue bag, the red plastic bag or the drugs.

26Dow gave evidence of previous occasions when he transported drugs from Sydney to Perth on the instructions of the appellant. He said there were about five or six such occasions.

27Dow gave evidence of an occasion in early 2004 when he took a package to Perth, which was collected from him at the Rydges Hotel. Dow was paid about $4,000 or $5,000 for this delivery. On another occasion in 2004, the appellant came to Dow's apartment and gave him a vacuum sealed package containing methylamphetamine. Dow put it down the front of his pants when he walked through security at Sydney airport. In Perth, he handed the package to Pereira in the toilet of the McDonald's food outlet. Dow was paid about $10,000 for this delivery.

28On another occasion in early to mid-2005, the appellant came to Dow's apartment in Rose Bay and gave him a package for delivery to Perth. It was also a vacuum sealed clear plastic bag containing a white crystalline substance. Dow took the package through security tucked down his pants. He gave this package to Pereira at the McDonald's outlet in Perth.

29On another occasion in 2005, Dow was given a vacuum sealed bag containing a white crystalline powder by the appellant or Pereira. He transported the package to Perth where he telephoned the appellant. Consistent with the appellant's instructions, Dow got into the back seat of a car near the McDonald's outlet and placed the package in the car before being driven back to his hotel.

30A further trip from Sydney to Perth in December 2005 was said to be the subject of a drug delivery, although Dow could not remember any of the details in relation to that occasion.

31Dow's evidence was that he thought he had been paid a total of about $80,000 to deliver drugs on the appellant's instructions. He had earlier given evidence that the total payment was in the vicinity of $80,000 to $120,000, whereas he had also previously told the police that it was in the vicinity of $60,000 to $70,000.

32Dow accepted in cross-examination that he had told the Australian Crime Commission that he transported drugs to Perth on only one occasion, namely 11 April 2006. However, he said that as at 22 August 2006, he was prepared to lie on oath when it suited him, including telling the Australian Crime Commission that his statement to police on the morning of 12 April 2006 was not true in so far as it maintained that there was more than one delivery.

33Dow also accepted that he had lied to police when he told them that he had only taken drugs to Perth on two occasions. He gave evidence at the committal proceedings that he had transported drugs on three or four occasions in total. He could not remember what he had said in the course of his evidence in the aborted trial, namely that it was ""5, 6, .. 7, 3, 4, 5, 6 - it was a few times, sir"". He later said it may have even been as many as seven or eight times.

34In mid March 2006, Pereira came to Dow's apartment and gave him a vacuum sealed bag containing money. The package contained $50 and $100 notes. When Dow arrived in Perth, he called the appellant who came to his hotel with an Asian man. Dow was not paid for this trip.

35An Australian Crime Commission investigator conducting surveillance in Perth on 16 March 2006 saw the appellant leaving the Rydges Hotel shortly after 10 pm. The appellant was carrying a white plastic shopping bag containing an object about the size of an AFL football. At 11:57 pm he saw the appellant leave the lift area of the hotel in the company of an Asian/Malaysian man. On 17 March 2006 he saw the appellant enter the hotel restaurant where Dow was sitting, wink and nod to Dow and then sit at a table in the corner.

36Under cross-examination, Dow agreed that he had banked $8,000 on 16 March 2006, but he denied that this was a payment from Pereira. He accepted that he had told the Australian Crime Commission that Pereira had never given him any money, probably because he had forgotten about this occasion. He also told the Australian Crime Commission that more than $50,000 which he deposited in May 2006 was from gambling. Dow's evidence was that it was either the proceeds of gambling or moneys that he had accumulated from payment for drug runs, or both.

37Dow also gave evidence of taking money from Perth to Sydney on behalf of the appellant. Dow did this on about five or six occasions, the first time being late 2003 or early 2004. The appellant came to Dow's hotel room in Perth and asked him to take money back to Sydney. He emptied a bag onto the bed containing $5,000 and $10,000 bundles. On this occasion, Dow did not have enough room in his bag so he only took $80,000. The appellant came to Dow's apartment in Sydney the following day and retrieved the money.

38On another occasion in mid to late 2004, Dow transported $30,000 or $40,000 to Sydney from Perth. There were one or two trips in 2005, relating to the delivery on each occasion of about the same amount of money.

39According to his evidence at trial, Dow transported money from Sydney to Perth perhaps once or twice. He acknowledged that he had told the Australian Crime Commission that he had taken money from Sydney to Perth five times and from Perth to Sydney once. Dow denied that he had lied in this respect. He had simply transposed the number of trips. 

Deemed Supply of Methylamphetamine

40The appellant was arrested at 6:45 am on 12 April 2006 at Sydney domestic airport. He was cautioned and declined to be interviewed. A search of his home carried out later that day resulted in the discovery of 7.1 gms of methylamphetamine in a cupboard of a spare bedroom. 

41A video recording of the search was before the jury. The hanging space of the cupboard contained male clothing and the drawers contained, among other things, male business socks. Two passports in the appellant's name, a number of Qantas documents linked to Dow and a box containing two resealable bags of methylamphetamine were removed from the top drawer. There was also a bag containing $129,650 on a shelf above the drawers. (This was the subject of count 3)

42The appellant pointed to evidence of a New Year's Eve party at the premises on 31 December 2005 in order to suggest that a number of persons who had access to the spare room may have been responsible for the presence of the drugs.

Dow's Credibility.

43The appellant's case at trial was advanced by way of cross-examination of Dow. It was put to Dow that he had given false evidence against the appellant and that his transportation of drugs and money was for someone other than the appellant. It was also suggested that the falsity of his evidence was unlikely to be detected by a jury, given that Dow had been a paid professional actor since about 1998 and had developed skills in engaging an audience and presenting a character. It was also put and denied that the reason the appellant would try to find out when Dow was flying to Perth was so that Dow could upgrade the appellant from economy to business class.

44It was not disputed that the appellant had taken numerous flights to Western Australia, which was said to be consistent with his legitimate business interests in the timber industry. The appellant did not dispute that he had flown to Perth on 11 April and that he had spoken to Dow at the airport. Such contact as there was between the appellant and Dow was explained by reference to the appellant's friendship with Dow's wife. Dow had been out socially with his wife, the appellant and the appellant's partner and Dow was to be invited to the appellant's wedding.

45Dow acknowledged that there were occasions when the appellant asked him when he was flying to Perth, independent of any drugs or money transactions, and that Dow had previously upgraded the appellant from economy to business class. He agreed that when he and the appellant were in Perth at the same time they would communicate with one another and that there were meetings in Perth that had nothing to do with carrying drugs or money.

46Dow confirmed that in the course of his preliminary conversations with police he had lied to them in the hope of avoiding prosecution. He did not know of the police surveillance and telephone intercepts. He also acknowledged lying on oath to the Australian Crime Commission, at least until he was made aware that he could receive additional prison time if his answers were found to be false.

47When Dow gave evidence against the appellant in May 2009 in the course of the aborted trial, he had collected and studied all of his police records of interview (of which there were three), the transcripts of his Australian Crime Commission evidence, the transcripts of his evidence during the appellant's committal and the transcripts of his evidence during his own sentencing proceedings. For the purposes of the September 2009 trial, he had regard to the transcript of his sentencing proceedings and the transcript of the aborted trial, although he had not studied them.

48Dow acknowledged that he had promised to give evidence against the appellant in the hope of securing a discount on his own sentence. He also acknowledged that should he not give evidence against the appellant in accordance with his undertaking he could receive a longer sentence. Dow received a sentence of 6 years and one month, reduced from a starting point of 11 years on account of his assistance to the authorities.

49In summary, the appellant's case on count 1, put in cross-examination of Dow, and denied by him, was that the appellant had never supplied him with methylamphetamine, that he had received the drugs on 10 April 2006 from someone other than the appellant, that he knew the appellant had been to his apartment on 10 April 2006 and that he was trying to ""fit up"" the appellant in order to obtain for himself the least possible punishment. 

Evidence Confirmatory of Dow.

50There were a number of telephone intercepts that were the subject of evidence at the trial. These intercepts related to telephone subscriber numbers ending in 778 (Dow's phone), 436 (falsely subscribed to Jason Simonds at an address in Abbotsford, but primarily used by the appellant), 434 (falsely subscribed to Sam Li at 438 Sussex St, Sydney, but primarily used by the appellant and in his possession on his arrest) and 634 (falsely subscribed to Sam Li with a different birth date of 438 Sussex St, Sydney). This latter phone was not found. The Crown maintained that this number was also primarily used by the appellant.

51The appellant left Perth airport at 11:30am on 11 April and entered a vehicle registered to Michael Simich, said to be the appellant's business associate in a timber enterprise. The route travelled by the vehicle between midday and 6:15pm coincided with cell towers in various locations receiving and transmitting 14 calls from the subscriber number ending in 634 (the appellant) to the subscriber numbers ending in 491 (the white Nokia given to Dow) and 778 (Dow). All of these calls were made after Dow's arrest. Shortly after 6pm, the appellant called Dow's wife using subscriber number 434 to tell her that he had been trying to contact Dow without success.

52The call charge records and surveillance evidence also established that, between 6:20pm and 6:32pm while the appellant was staying at the Duxton Hotel in Perth on 11 April 2006, he received two calls on the subscriber number ending 434. At 7:55pm there is a call placed from the Duxton Hotel to Dow on the number ending 778.

53In addition to the evidence set out immediately above, the Crown also relied upon the finding of the methylamphetamine in the appellant's premises as confirmatory of Dow. It is therefore convenient to deal with the grounds of the appeal that relate to count 2, before turning to a consideration of the unreasonable verdicts ground.

Error in Refusing to Sever Count 2.

54At the beginning of the trial, prior to the empanelment of the jury on 18 August 2009, the appellant's legal representative made an application to sever counts 2 and 3 from the trial of count 1 on the indictment. 

55In relation to count 2, the application before the trial judge relied upon the fact that the quantity of methylamphetamine, the subject of count 2, could not be said to relate in any way to the quantity or composition of the methylamphetamine, the subject of count 1. It was submitted that Dow was unable to give evidence of any relevant comparison between the drugs that he carried to Perth on 11 April and the small quantity of methylamphetamine found in the appellant's premises. 

56Dow was able to say that the drug supplied from time to time by the appellant was granular, powdery or in solid form. The Crown acknowledged that the methylamphetamine in the two separate resealable bags did not appear to resemble each other. One appeared granular while the other appeared more powdery. 

57It was argued that the fact that methylamphetamine was readily available, the different packaging referable to count 2 as opposed to count 1, and the absence of evidence relating to the composition of the respective quantities of methylamphetamine, rendered the subject of count 2 of marginal relevance and therefore visited the danger of unfair prejudice on the appellant that outweighed the probative value of the finding of 7.1 g of methylamphetamine.

58The trial judge gave a preliminary ruling on 17 August 2009 declining to sever count 2 from count 1. In the course of that ruling, his Honour said :- 

... having considered her Honour's ruling in relation to the application that was made in the same way when the matter was previously listed for trial l decline the application. I need not say anything further than, I, having considered her Honour's reasons, adopt her reasons.
It does appear to me that there may be an additional basis for the counts remaining together as I have flagged with counsel, that it may be relevant to rebut the case of the accused, however, it is unnecessary for me to consider that matter further in the light of my adopting her Honour's reasons for judgment. That matter, on its own, is not determinative, though it does appear to me to be another basis upon which the finding of the drugs, the subject of count 2, are relevant in relation to count 1.

59The first paragraph was a reference to the reasons of Judge Flannery SC delivered on 7 November 2008 in the course of the aborted trial. The second paragraph dealt with an ""additional"" basis for refusing to sever count 2 from count 1.

60The application before Judge Flannery SC proceeded on the basis that the appellant only sought the severance of the charge relating to possession of the proceeds of crime from the remaining charges. It was submitted by the appellant's legal representative (the same legal representative in the later trial) that the appellant would be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence of the drug charges, given that Dow claimed to have had conversations with the appellant about the commission of armed robberies by the appellant and others. In order to cross-examine Dow on the subject of the proceeds of crime charge, it was submitted that it was necessary to raise the subject matter of these alleged conversations with Dow. 

61Her Honour accepted that the finding of the cash in the same cupboard as two resealable plastic bags containing methylamphetamine was probative, in the sense that the offences (that is, all three counts) arose out of the same set of circumstances (s 29(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Act). Her Honour was also not persuaded that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence relating to the finding of the cash and the two resealable plastic bags. Accordingly, the application to sever was rejected. 

62On 19 August 2009, the trial judge delivered further reasons that included the following :-
The application before her Honour was different in some respects; the application before her Honour involved an application to sever the count of possession of the proceeds of crime count from the other counts in the indictment. The application before me is that, one, that there be a separate trial in relation to the first count in the indictment. In the alternative, two, that there be a separate trial in relation to the second count in the indictment. The grounds of the application as stated in the notice of motion are as follows :-
A The accused will be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence of the first count in the indictment if the trial of the other counts in the indictment proceeds at the same time.
B In the alternative, the accused will be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence of the first and third counts in the indictment of the trial if the other count in the indictment proceeds at the same time.

The application here therefore contains the additional application that the second count of supply be separated from the first count.

...............................................................................
As I have previously indicated, the finding of the items, the subject of count 2 are relevant to count 1. They are relevant as circumstantial evidence of the accused having a ready supply of methyl amphetamine. They are relevant even though the amount found was considerably less than the quantity alleged to be involved in the transactions, the foundation of count 1. Amongst other things the appearance of the drug, the subject of count 2, is consistent with the appearance of the drug described by the key Crown witness allegedly provided to him by the accused. In the first trial there was no application that count 2 be separated from count 1.

... I am of the view on the material provided to me that the finding of the items, the subject of count 2, having similar characteristics is also relevant to rebutting the case of the accused that the key Crown witness is lying when he asserts that methylamphetamine, having the particular characteristics described, was provided to him by the accused. 
However, as I have indicated, this view is not determinative of the application before me and I reserve judgement as to whether the evidence of the finding of the drug, the subject of count 2, is relevant for that purpose and whether the Crown may put its case to the jury in that way.
.... I am of the view, having considered the matters referred to in s 29(1) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act that the counts be heard together. The accused is not prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence of the other counts in the indictment if they proceed together and it is not an abuse of process for the trial to proceed on the present indictment.

63The appellant now contends that the trial judge erred in the following respects :-
(a)His Honour failed to take into account or sufficiently take into account the very different nature of the items, both as to quantity and packaging.
(b)His Honour failed to consider or apply the appropriate test to the admission of tendency evidence.
(c)His Honour gave no consideration himself as to the risk that the evidence might be used by the jury in an unfair way.
(d)His Honour gave no consideration himself to the unfair prejudice that would be caused to the appellant's case.
(e)His Honour gave no consideration to the effect on the jury's consideration of their verdict on count 2 when it was being heard in conjunction with count 1.

64At the outset, it is necessary to observe that the complaints under this ground of the appeal are fundamentally misconceived. The application with which his Honour was dealing was an application to sever counts on the indictment on the basis that the appellant's defence would be prejudiced or embarrassed. That defence consisted of attempting to demonstrate to the jury that Dow was an inveterate liar who had in effect ""set up"" the appellant. There was no aspect of the evidence relating to the finding of the methylamphetamine that prejudiced the appellant in any way in his cross-examination of Dow. It was not suggested that Dow had anything to do with the methylamphetamine in the appellant's premises.

65It was not an application under s 135 and/or s 137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence of the finding of the methylamphetamine on the basis that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative of count 2 on the indictment. Nor could it have been, given that the finding of the methylamphetamine was entirely probative of count 2. 

66In truth, the appellant's proposition was that the evidence of the finding of the methylamphetamine prejudiced the appellant's defence in relation to count 1 on the indictment. In other words, the fact that a quantity of methylamphetamine was found in the appellant's premises rendered it less likely that the jury would accept the appellant's contention that Dow was a liar. That was precisely the basis upon which the Crown foreshadowed its reliance on count 2 in support of Dow. 

67The capacity of evidence, which is relevant and admissible towards proof of one count on an indictment, to compromise an accused's defence in respect of another count on the same indictment, is not necessarily a basis for characterising that evidence as ""prejudicial"" in the sense in which that term is used in ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. The relevant prejudice ""is not that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case"" : R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139 ; Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325. Rather, it refers to the danger that the jury may use the evidence on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the trial, by way of, for example, appealing to the jury's sympathies, arousing a sense of horror, or provoking an instinct to punish.

68There was no basis upon which the jury would approach the evidence of the finding of the methylamphetamine on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the trial. To the contrary, the finding of the methylamphetamine at the appellant's premises was central to proof of count 2 and of significance to the jury's assessment of Dow's credibility. Any residual prejudice that might arise was capable of being addressed by directions. Appropriate directions were given.

69Early in the course of the summing up, the judge directed the jury that they must consider each of the counts against the appellant separately. The judge went on to say that :-

the accused is entitled, as is the Crown, to separate consideration of each of the counts. It would be quite wrong to say simply because you find the accused guilty or not guilty on one count that the accused must be guilty of the other. Each count must be considered separately, in the light of the evidence that applies to it, by asking as to each count separately, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence that the accused is guilty or not guilty of that count. What you must not do is arrive at a decision about one count and then apply that decision to the other count. The decision to convict the accused on one count should be put out of your mind when proceeding to consider the other counts. The trials of each count are heard together as a matter of convenience and because there is a body of evidence that is common to the counts. So in summary, you must consider each count separately and decide in relation to each count whether the Crown has proved that count beyond reasonable doubt.

70Later in the summing up, when the judge was dealing with the evidence relied upon by the Crown as supportive or confirmatory of Dow, his Honour said of the finding of the methylamphetamine in the drawer :-

The Crown relies upon this finding to provide support or confirmation of the evidence of Mr Dow as I have indicated. The evidence can only be used in the way the Crown asks you to if you are, firstly, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession of the methylamphetamine in the drawer. And I remind you of the written directions relating to proof of possession. You may only consider this evidence for the limited purpose of providing support or confirmation of the evidence of Mr Dow. So if you are satisfied that the accused did in fact have possession of the methylamphetamine then you may use that fact as providing support for or confirmation of the evidence of Mr Dow. The evidence, ladies and gentlemen, must not be used in any other way. It would be completely wrong to reason that because the accused has possession of the methylamphetamine in the drawer that he is therefore generally a person who has possession of methylamphetamine, and for that reason must have committed the offences in count one and count three in the indictment.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a danger about which I must warn you, and that is, the danger that such evidence will set off in your minds that prohibited line of reasoning. The jury is never permitted to use such evidence for the purpose of concluding that the accused person is guilty of the crime with which he or she is charged simply because he or she is the sort of person who would be likely to commit that crime. As I say, ladies and gentlemen, that is a prohibited line of reasoning and my firm direction to you is that you must not allow that reasoning to enter into your deliberations.

71Against this background, I turn to the appellant's particular complaints.

72As to (a), it is clear that the judge gave appropriate consideration to the issue of packaging and quantity. The ""similar characteristics"" borne by the drug the subject of count 2 and the drug alleged to have been supplied by the appellant to Dow over a period of 22 months, that is, that it was a powdery or crystalline form of methylamphetamine, was correctly taken into account as a factor in the application.

73As to (b), at no stage did the Crown purport to rely upon the finding of the methylamphetamine in the appellant's premises as tendency evidence. Nor was there any application on the part of the appellant's legal representative to exclude it on that basis. In any event, the directions to the jury set out at [70] above were sufficient to guard against the employment of any tendency reasoning by the jury. 

74As to (c), and (d), the complaints appear to be based upon the judge's adoption of Flannery SC DCJ's reasons of 7 November 2008. The appellant overlooks the effect of s 130A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which provides that a pre-trial order made by a judge in proceedings on indictment is binding on the trial judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding. Although the ruling of Flannery SC DCJ of 7 November 2008 was not strictly a pre-trial ruling, it was nonetheless a ruling which ought to have been followed in the interests of comity, unless the trial judge considered that it was plainly wrong.

75In any event, the trial judge did turn his own mind to the basis of the appellant's application, as demonstrated by the reasons set out at [62]. As I have endeavoured to explain above, there was no relevant unfair prejudice to the appellant that could not be cured by directions.

76As to (e), this complaint appears to be a variant of (c) and (d). Ultimately, his Honour did turn his attention to the confined way in which the jury could use the evidence of the finding of the methylamphetamine and directed the jury accordingly.

77The appellant has failed to establish any error in the judge's approach on this ground.

Error in Refusing to Direct a Verdict on Count 2.

78At the close of the Crown case, the appellant's legal representative made an application for a directed verdict on count 2. Essentially, his argument was that the Crown could not exclude possession of the drug in another, including the appellant's partner who lived in the premises and any number of persons who had attended a New Year's Eve party in December 2005.

79After reviewing the recording of the search during which the drugs were found, his Honour declined the application on the basis that all of the physical circumstances relating to the particular drawer where the drugs were found constituted sufficient evidence to go to the jury on the issue of possession. Those physical circumstances are referred to at [41] above.

80The test for determining whether there is a case to answer is uncontroversial. In R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377, Dunford J (James J and Smart AJ agreeing) said at [127] :-

the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands, the accused ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands, he could lawfully be convicted: May v O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In considering such an application, the judge does not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case: R v Towers (1984) 14 A Crim R 12 at 14, Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214-5, R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74;

81In Doney v The Queen, the High Court stated that :-

if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

82The evidence pertaining to the drawer within which the drugs were found, and to the cupboard within which the drawer was located, was, taken at its highest, capable of supporting a finding of fact by the jury that the appellant knowingly possessed the two resealable bags of methylamphetamine to the exclusion of others. The physical circumstances were entirely consistent with the sole use of, and access to, the cupboard by the only male occupant of the premises, namely the appellant. 

83It is of some relevance to this ground that there is no appeal against the verdict on count 3. Acceptance by the jury of the Crown case that the money was the proceeds of the appellant's supply of methylamphetamine, and the fact that the money was found within the cupboard, strengthens the Crown case on the deemed supply charge.

84There is no substance to this ground.

Error in Directions to the Jury Relating to Count 2. 

85This ground complains of the directions given by the trial judge in respect of the finding of the methylamphetamine at the appellant's premises as supportive or confirmatory of Dow. To the extent that the appellant now maintains that the evidence of the finding of the methylamphetamine was not supportive or confirmatory of Dow, I would reject that submission for the reasons set out at [66] to [68] above.

86The appellant submits that the trial judge's reference to R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341 reveals error in his approach. In the course of a discussion with the appellant's legal representative, the judge expressed the view that because the Crown was relying upon a course of conduct over a 22 month period towards proof of count 1, the evidence of the methylamphetamine in the appellant's premises tended to support the evidence of Dow that he was given a white crystalline substance over that period of time by the appellant.

87In Hamzy, Hunt CJ at CL observed (Abadee and Simpson JJ agreeing) :-

Where the Crown seeks to establish a particular activity or enterprise, it relies upon every act which it intends to prove (although, obviously enough, it does not have to establish every such act in order to succeed). ..........................................
Next, it is said that proof of an activity or enterprise in accordance with this principle permits the Crown to call what is in effect propensity evidence without the protection of proper directions as to the use which may legitimately be made of that evidence. But the evidence is not of mere propensity to commit this particular crime. Each individual act of supply is directly relevant to the issue which the Crown seeks to prove - namely, in the present case, that the appellant was engaged in the criminal enterprise of dealing in heroin. There is nothing said in either Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 or Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590 which would prevent such a course being followed. If it is thought that a direction is needed in the particular case in order to avoid any misuse by the jury of such evidence, such a direction should be given: cf The King v Marley (1932) 47 CLR 618 at 621; Harriman v The Queen (at 609); Regina v Martin (1990) 48 A Crim R 208 at 212. (Italics not in original)

88This passage from Hamzy supports the approach taken by the trial judge. It was the Crown case that the appellant was engaged in the criminal enterprise of supplying methylamphetamine. It did not matter that the Crown did not seek to accumulate the methylamphetamine the subject of count 2 with the other amounts said to be supplied for the purposes of count 1. Once the jury were, in accordance with the trial judge's directions, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession for supply of the methylamphetamine found in his premises, that fact tended to support the evidence of Dow.

89To the extent that the appellant also complains of the impermissible use of the evidence relating to count 2 as tendency evidence, I have already dealt with the adequacy of the trial judge's directions in that respect.

90This ground has not been made out.

Unreasonable Verdicts

91The principles to be applied in a consideration of this ground are well settled : M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, and R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 85 ALJR 8. 

92In M v R, at 493, and 494 - 495, the High Court stated :-
Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt...

93It is not sufficient in order to discharge this function to determine whether there is evidence upon which a jury could have convicted, but whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt. 

94The appellant's principal submission on this ground is that the Court should find Anthony Dow unworthy of belief and that he could not be accepted by any reasonable jury as a witness of honesty and reliability. The bases for this submission are :-

(i)The fact that Dow pleaded guilty and gave evidence pursuant to an undertaking, resulting in a substantial discount on the sentence he received. This factor predisposed Dow to maintain a false version of events lest he receive a larger gaol sentence.

(ii)The fact that Dow was an admitted liar in that he had lied to the arresting police, to the Australian Crime Commission, in the course of the committal proceedings, in the course of the aborted trial and, it was submitted, in the course of the trial resulting in the appellant's conviction.

(iii)The fact that Dow's credibility was not amenable to assessment by a jury, because of his training and employment history as an actor, his capacity to learn to play a role and engage an audience and his capacity to memorise the transcripts of his records of interview and court proceedings, in order to deal with the inconsistencies contained therein.

95The appellant relied upon a number of inconsistencies in Dow's evidence.

(1)The date upon which he received the drugs from the appellant. Having told the arresting police that he received the drug the night before (10 April), his account before the jury established that he had received the drugs from the appellant on 7 April.

(2)The provision by the appellant of the address in Perth for delivery of the drugs. Dow told the arresting police that he had written the address on the card ""last week"". He acknowledged before the jury that that was a lie. Dow claimed to have written the street name on the card and then altered it, following correction by the appellant. The exhibit produced at trial contained no corrections. The cross examination at trial went some way towards demonstrating that Dow only had access to his wallet, from which the card was obtained, after the appellant left the premises.

(3)The variation in the number of trips from Sydney to Perth and/or from Perth to Sydney, relating to the supply of drugs and the transportation of money. Dow's accounts of drug deliveries given to police, to the Crime Commission, to the committal proceedings and at trial varied from once, through to three or four times, six or seven times, ""maybe even seven or eight"". His account of the transportation of money to the Crime Commission amounted to five times from Sydney to Perth and once from Perth to Sydney. At trial, his evidence was four or five times from Perth to Sydney and once or twice from Sydney to Perth.

(4)The variation in the sums of money obtained by Dow as reward. Dow told police the sum was $60000-$70000 in total, and he told the jury at the aborted trial that he had been paid $80,000 to $120,000. 

(5)Dow's observation of the contents of the blue bag. Dow's evidence was that he was shown the vacuum sealed package containing a white substance and bundles of money inside the blue bag. Dow was unable to account for a red plastic bag within which the drugs were found by police in the garage of the townhouse.

(6)The lack of any explanation for the removal of a large quantity of money from the blue bag, after the appellant is said to have left it in a bedroom cupboard on 7 April and the inherent unlikelihood that the appellant would leave a bag containing a large quantity of methylamphetamine in a cupboard to which Dow's wife and stepdaughter had access.

(7)Dow's evidence before the jury that the appellant told him to book on the same flight to Perth on 11 April was inconsistent with his statement to the arresting police that he had chosen the flight himself.

(8)Dow""s evidence that it was his idea to tape the packet of drugs to his body was inconsistent with his statement to arresting police that he had been instructed to do so.

(9)Dow's evidence that Pereira had given him a vacuum sealed packet of money on 16 March 2006 is inconsistent with his statement to the Crime Commission that Pereira had never given him money.

96The appellant also enumerated the many lies that Dow told to police immediately after his arrest, to the Crime Commission on 22 and 23 August 2006, and to the jury. Principal among the lies told in the course of his evidence, the appellant relies upon the fact that Dow falsely complained of unlawful conduct by interviewing police at the Crime Commission, namely that he had been denied medication, told what to say in the interview, threatened by interviewing police and denied the services of a lawyer. The appellant further pointed to aspects of Dow's evidence which he claimed were inherently suspect.

97The combination of these matters requires any tribunal of fact to approach an assessment of the credibility of Dow with the utmost caution. That requirement was recognized by the trial judge who gave a full and forceful direction to the jury (about which no complaint is presently made) pursuant to the terms of s 165 of the Evidence Act.

98The judge's warning referred to the fact that Dow was criminally concerned in the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and to the fact that Dow had admitted giving false evidence on oath. The potential unreliability of Dow as a witness was brought to the jury's attention. They were instructed that Dow fell into that category of witness who may wish to falsely accuse others of conduct for which the witness was solely responsible or out of motives of revenge or feelings of dislike or hostility. They were also instructed that Dow may have been strongly motivated to give false evidence in order to preserve the discount on the sentence he had received for his part in the offence. The details of that discount were conveyed to the jury. The jury was instructed that the fact that Dow's conduct and conviction qualified him as a witness of bad character affected his reliability and honesty as a witness. The jury were also warned that Dow may have had motives to lie, of which the appellant was unaware, and which may not be able to be explored in cross-examination.

99Immediately after the direction outlined above, the jury were warned of the consequences of the reliance by the Crown on the evidence of Dow towards proof of count 1. The jury were directed that :-

unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Dow is both an honest and accurate witness when he tells you that it was the accused who supplied him with the methylamphetamine for delivery to Western Australia, you cannot find the accused guilty. And before you can convict the accused you should examine the evidence of Mr Dow very carefully in order to satisfy yourself that you can safely act upon the evidence. ..... and I warn you, ladies and gentlemen, that it would be dangerous for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused on the evidence of Mr Dow unless you are satisfied that his evidence is supported or confirmed by other evidence which indicates that such evidence is true. In this respect what you must look for is evidence from an independent source which tends to show not only that the crime charged was committed, but the accused was implicated in it in the way alleged by the Crown.

100These directions constitute an entirely orthodox and sound approach by the trial judge to the critical issue in the trial, namely the honesty and reliability of Dow. It is appropriate therefore to turn to the evidence which was said to provide support for the conclusion that Dow was a truthful and reliable witness.

101There was independent evidence concerning the appellant's delivery of the methylamphetamine in the small blue bag on 7 April 2006. Dow had only recently moved to the Francis Street address. Telephone intercepts recorded the appellant contacting Dow's wife in order to obtain the street number of the residence, and confirming that number with Dow from a public phone booth in the same street. Police surveillance of the appellant and Pereira established that both men entered the residence and the appellant twice returned to his car, carrying a ""long, white, round object"" (consistent with a package of methylamphetamine) and secondly, a small blue sports bag.

102There was independent evidence of the events of 10 April 2006. A telephone intercept on that day recorded Dow's enquiries in relation to a Qantas flight from Sydney to Perth. Police surveillance established that the appellant and Pereira returned to the Dow residence at about 8:38 pm that evening. A further telephone intercept after the appellant and Pereira left the Dow residence confirmed Dow's further efforts to make a booking for a Qantas flight from Sydney to Perth.

103There was independent evidence of the events of 11 April 2006. The appellant and Dow were seen at Sydney domestic terminal and they were seen in conversation in the Qantas departure lounge. Telephone intercept material established a call from Dow to his wife after his arrival in Perth while in a taxi cab. The appellant also placed a call to his fiancee after arriving in Perth. The evidence of the taxi driver confirmed that Dow went to an address in Roscorla Avenue, Yokine where he took a small bag to the middle townhouse, returned to the taxi without it, and then requested to be driven back to the airport. A police search of the garage of that town house located the blue sports bag containing a long, white, round plastic bag containing methylamphetamine.

104Police surveillance of Pham in the driveway of the Roscorla Avenue townhouse was relevant to the appellant's connection with the supply of the methylamphetamine, given the appellant's association with Pham in Perth in March 2005.

105There was independent evidence of the use by the appellant of two mobile phones falsely subscribed to Sam Li in the course of the appellant's journey around Perth in the afternoon of 11 April 2006. There were repeated attempts on the part of the appellant to contact Dow, using these mobile phones, on a third falsely subscribed mobile phone which was in Dow's possession on his arrest. The appellant's efforts to contact Dow were confirmed by the appellant's call to Dow's wife that evening. One of the falsely subscribed mobiles (the number ending in 434) was in the appellant's possession on his arrest at Sydney domestic airport on 12 April.

106There was independent evidence of the appellant's connection with the supply of methylamphetamine and his relationship with Dow, that is, the contents of the cupboard in the spare room of the appellant's home on 12 April 2006.

107There was independent evidence in relation to the delivery of money by Dow to the appellant in Perth on 15 and 16 March 2006. Surveillance evidence established the presence of both Dow and the appellant at the Rydges Hotel. The appellant was seen carrying an object consistent with a large package of money.

108There was independent evidence in the form of a ""Master Schedule of Travel Movements and Deposits Made by Dow"" (part of Ex A) of the appellant's numerous trips (on 20 occasions) to Perth at about the same time as Dow between 6 March 2005 and 12 April 2006. The Schedule established that there were deposits of relatively large sums of money into Dow's bank accounts at times consistent with Dow's trips to Perth.

109Having reviewed the evidence at trial and having regard to the evidence outlined above that supported Dow's evidence in material respects, I do not entertain any doubt in relation to the appellant's conviction. In arriving at this conclusion, I do not disregard or discount any of the inconsistencies, lies and/or discrepancies in the evidence of Dow. However, many, if not most, of the lies can be, and were, explained by Dow's own admission that he was prepared to lie to police and to the Crime Commission to avoid the consequences of his conduct, until it became clear to him that he had been under surveillance for some time and that there was no utility in attempting to maintain his innocence. Furthermore, many, if not most, of the inconsistencies and discrepancies relied upon by the appellant related to matters of detail (for example, when Dow wrote the address on the card, the red plastic bag containing the drugs, the number of trips, and whether Dow was instructed to tape the drugs to his body) which ultimately fell away when considered against the considerable body of independent evidence implicating the appellant.

110The use of falsely subscribed mobile phones by the appellant and the presence of a large quantity of cash, along with two resealable bags of methylamphetamine in the appellant's premises are powerful indicia of supply. These features of the trial were in no way dependent on the evidence of Dow. The fact that the appellant may have been able to advance an entirely legitimate reason for his many trips to Perth, for his activities in Perth on 11 April 2006 and for his relationship with Dow, does not reduce the combined force of Dow's evidence and the independent evidence summarised above.

111These were all matters that were brought home to the jury by counsels' respective addresses and the directions in the summing up. Most importantly, given the appellant's criticisms of the practised nature of Dow's testimony, the jury enjoyed the advantage of hearing and seeing Dow. His admitted lies and the inconsistencies in his evidence were laid bare before the jury. The jury was clearly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his honesty and reliability on the critical issue in the trial, namely the appellant's involvement in the ongoing supply of methylamphetamine, notwithstanding the criticisms by the appellant's counsel and the warnings given by the trial judge.

112Any doubt that arose as a result of the attack on the credibility of Dow, which was justified and extensive, was plainly capable of being resolved by the objective evidence that confirmed the appellant's ongoing supply of methylamphetamine and, more importantly, by the opportunity afforded to the jury to consider the content and manner of Dow's responses to very lengthy and probing cross examination. 

113I would dismiss this ground of the appeal.

114I propose the following order :-
(1)Appeal against conviction dismissed.

115HARRISON J : I agree with Latham J.

		23 August 2012",2012-08-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759907,Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2012] NSWCA 262,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: This is a summons for leave to appeal from a decision of Garling J (the primary judge) in which his Honour dismissed a motion brought by the applicants seeking an order varying restraining orders made against them under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (""the Act""), to permit the payment of their legal expenses in respect of sentencing proceedings. At the time of the motion the applicants' sentencing proceedings were listed for hearing before Solomon DCJ on 29 July 2011, in respect of the first applicant and 12 August 2011, in respect of the second applicant.

2The Court ordered a concurrent hearing of the application for leave to appeal and the appeal, should leave be granted.

Background to the proceedings

3The applicants were charged in 2010 with serious drug related offences. The trial of these charges was scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011. A restraining order had been made in respect of the assets of the applicants under the provisions of the Act.

4On 9 December 2010, Adams J made an order pursuant to s 10B(3)(b) and s 12(1) of the Act making provision for meeting the reasonable expenses of the applicants, agreed at $375,000 (plus GST), out of the interest in specified property of the first applicant, such sum to be paid to Nyman Gibson Stewart Solicitors.

5During the course of the application for the variation of the restraining order, the applicants gave undertakings in the following terms:

""The first defendant [the first applicant] undertakes to the Court and the plaintiff not to make any further applications for legal expenses under either sections 10B(3)(b) or 12(1) of the Act or otherwise, with respect of the trial of drug charges presently scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011.""

""The fourth defendant [the second applicant] undertakes to the Court and the plaintiff not to make any further applications for reasonable legal expenses under either sections 10B(3)(b) or 12(1) of the Act or otherwise, with respect of the trial of drug charges presently scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011.""

6The trial of the applicants for the drug offences commenced on 24 January 2011 and continued over a number of weeks. The applicants were found guilty on various charges. Following those verdicts they made an application to the primary judge for release of further funds to cover their legal expenses in respect of the sentencing proceedings.

7The proceedings before the primary judge proceeded on the assumption that if the undertakings given covered legal expenses which would be incurred in the sentencing proceedings, an order should not be made. The same approach was taken on the application for leave to appeal.

8The primary judge held that the undertaking covered legal expenses in respect of the sentencing proceedings and as a consequence dismissed the motion.

The reasoning of the primary judge

9The primary judge contended that the words in the undertaking ""with respect of the trial of drug charges presently scheduled to commence on 17 January 2011"" should be given their ordinary meaning, having regard to the context in which they appeared. He concluded that the relevant context included s 10B(3)(b) of the Act, which permitted variation of restraining orders to permit payment of ""reasonable legal expenses ... incurred in defending a criminal charge"". He concluded that that expression was apt to include sentencing proceedings. He then considered whether the words of the undertaking compelled a different meaning. He concluded that they did not, stating that the words identified the particular proceedings in question and that, having regard to the context to which he had referred, the trial involved all proceedings the result of which would be recorded on the indictment, including the imposition of sentence.

The respondent's submissions

10The respondent submitted that leave should not be granted as the issues involved were insubstantial and peculiar to the instant case.

11The respondent further submitted that the primary judge was correct. It submitted that sentencing proceedings were an integral part of a trial, which included arraignment on an indictment, evidence being led before a jury, verdict of conviction or acquittal and sentencing following conviction, or discharge following acquittal. It submitted that the words ""with respect of"" were words of wide import and supported the conclusion reached by the primary judge. It submitted the distinction between trial and sentencing contained in s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was irrelevant to the construction of the undertaking.

Consideration

12The principles upon which leave to appeal is granted are well established. Ordinarily it is only appropriate to grant leave concerning matters that involve issues of principle, questions of general public importance or where it is reasonably clear there has been an injustice in the sense of going beyond it being reasonably arguable that the primary judge was in error: Carolan v AMF Bowling Pty Ltd [1995] NSWCA 69; Zelden v Sewell [2011] NSWCA 56 at [22]; Jaycar Pty Ltd v Lombardo [2011] NSWCA 284 at [46]; GKD v Director of Department of Family & Community Service [2012] NSWCA 219 at [10]; Be Financial Pty Ltd v Das [2012] NSWCA 164 at [32]-[34].

13As I have reached the clear view that the conclusion of the primary judge, with respect, was incorrect, in my opinion the applicants suffered an injustice such that it is appropriate to grant leave. 

14As the primary judge pointed out, the principles in interpreting an undertaking of this nature, namely one given as part of a consent order and given both to the parties and to the Court, are those generally applied in the interpretation of a contract: Nokia Corporation v Liu [2009] FCAFC 138; (2009) 179 FCR 422 at [29]-[30]; Athens v Randwick City Council [2005] NSWCA 317; (2005) 64 NSWLR 58 at [128]-[140].

15Thus, construction of the undertaking involves consideration of the text and the context in which it appears: Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22]. As with a contract, at least in the case of ambiguity, the circumstances surrounding the giving of the undertaking can be considered in determining its meaning: Nokia supra at [30]; International Hair Cosmetics Group Pty Limited v International Hair Cosmetics Limited [2011] FCA 339 at [49]; Athens v Randwick City Council supra at [28]; Kirkpatrick v Kotis [2004] NSWSC 1265; (2004) 62 NSWLR 567 at [39]-[45].

16In the present case, the undertaking was ""with respect of the trial of drug charges"". A trial has been defined as the examination and determination of a cause by a judicial tribunal or the determination of a person's guilt or innocence or the righteousness of his cause by a combat between the accuser and the accused. (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary of Historical Principles, 3rd ed (1973).) This definition accords, in my view, with the general accepted meaning of the expression ""trial"". It does not as a matter of ordinary meaning mean a sentence consequent upon the determination of guilt.

17The statutory context in which the undertaking was given, in my view, supports this distinction. The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 draws a distinction between proceedings relating to the trial of a person and proceedings relating to sentencing. Trial procedure is dealt with by Ch 3, Pt 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, whilst issues relating to sentencing are separately dealt with in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This distinction supports the view that the word ""trial"" in the undertaking related to the adjudication of guilt as distinct from sentencing following the verdicts.

18I do not think that s 10B(3)(b) of the Act compels a contrary conclusion. It merely recognises that a variation of a restraining order can be made to cover legal expenses in criminal proceedings including a trial or a sentence. It says nothing as to the distinction between the two. 

19Nor do I think that the expression ""with respect of"" alters the position. Although the words are of wide import, they must be considered in context: Workers Compensation Board (Q) v Technical Products Pty Limited [1988] HCA 49; (1988) 165 CLR 642 at 646-647, 653-654. The words in the present case would extend the expression ""trial of drug charges"" to proceedings ancillary to that trial, for example, pre trial directions and conferences. (See, for example, s 130, s 132 and s 136 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986). It would not, however, extend the expression ""the trial of drug charges"" to encompass sentencing proceedings consequent upon a finding of guilt.

Conclusion

20In these circumstances, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed. The respondent should pay the appellants' costs of the application for leave to appeal and the appeal. Costs of the motion in the court below should abide its ultimate determination.

21In these circumstances, the orders I would make are these:

1Grant the application for leave to appeal.

2Appeal allowed.

3Order the respondent pay the appellants' costs of the application for leave to appeal and the appeal.

4Remit the proceedings to the primary judge or another judge of the Common Law Division for determination in accordance with these reasons.

5Costs of the motion in the court below to be at the discretion of that judge who ultimately determines the motion.

22MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

23BARRETT JA: I agree with the Chief Justice. It is of particular significance that the undertakings were given upon the making of an order concerning the funding of legal expenses for District Court proceedings governed by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The context was one in which the distinction between ""trial"" and ""sentencing"" drawn by that Act cannot but have been in contemplation. The distinction is shown clearly by, among other provisions, paragraphs (a) and (b) of s 121 (which appears in Part 3 headed ""Trial procedures""):

""criminal proceedings"" means:

(a) proceedings relating to the trial of a person before the Supreme Court or the District Court,

(b) proceedings relating to the sentencing of a person by the Supreme Court or the District Court, or

(c) proceedings relating to an appeal under the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 to the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction.""

		23 August 2012",2012-08-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2759909,Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons in draft of Davies J. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour. I agree with his reasons in relation to ground 3. In relation to grounds 1 and 2, I would prefer to express my reasons shortly assuming the background and context set out in the reasons of Davies J.

2I refer to my reasons in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172. I do not wish to repeat anything I there said, beyond, first, stating once again my agreement with McCallum J (with whose reasons Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 at [35]-[36] that the fair reading of the whole of the reasons of a sentencing judge should take place with the recognition of the then perceived orthodoxy and correctness of cases such as R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 and R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338; and, secondly, emphasising that this is a matter of substance and not form or linguistics.

3I should commence by noting that Mr Boulten SC, who appeared for the applicant, accepted (plainly correctly, if I may respectfully say so) that this was not one of those cases where a broader concept of ""objective seriousness"" for the purposes of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 54A, might be seen to drain, for the purposes of evaluation in sentencing, the subjective circumstances of content or effect.

4It can be stated that the expression of the characterisation of the offence as ""slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" might be seen to give precision to an otherwise necessarily imprecise evaluation. The learned sentencing judge can be seen, however, to have been faithfully carrying out the requirements of this Court for some precision in those respects: Knight and McEvoy. That said, a reading of the whole of her Honour's reasons persuades me that she came to the sentence she did by an overall consideration of all the circumstances and not by giving undue weight to the guidepost of the standard non-parole period or by structuring the sentences around it or by reference to it.
5The reality of the debate was whether her Honour was justified in an evaluative assessment of the objective criminality of the offence. This may have been expressed by reference to the words of s 54A (""middle of the range of objective seriousness"") but her Honour was undertaking the entirely legitimate task of weighing and evaluating the objective criminality involved.

6The argument was that the offending was well below the middle of any range and really at the low end. If this were a demonstrably correct conclusion, the sentence would be excessive. I do not think that her Honour's evaluation was made in error, or was wrong. This was an intentional and vicious attack using a glass as a weapon to the head of a victim. It could have caused catastrophic injury. Luckily it did not; but the injury was still serious. I have no hesitation in agreeing with the evaluation of the criminality of the offence by the sentencing judge.

7On the basis of the legitimacy of the assessment of objective criminality of the offending and taking into account all the subjective circumstances that her Honour did (being accepted by Mr Boulten, again, with respect correctly, as ""punctilious and fair""), the sentence was just and proportionate.

8Thus I am unable to perceive any operative error under grounds 1 or 2.

9If I be wrong about the lack of existence of any ""Muldrock error"", I am otherwise unpersuaded that any lesser sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3).

10LATHAM J: I agree with Davies J and I agree with the reasons of Allsop P.

11DAVIES J: The Applicant was found guilty by a jury on 10 March 2011 of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). On 27 May 2011 he was sentenced by Judge Woodbourne SC to a period of 3 years non-parole commencing 27 May 2011 and expiring on 26 May 2014 with a balance of term of 3 years. 

12He now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the following grounds:

(1)Her Honour erred by giving determinative or primary consideration to the provision of the standard non-parole period;

(2)Her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective criminality of the offending conduct;

(3)The sentence is manifestly excessive.

Background

13The facts are taken from Judge Woodbourne's findings in her Remarks on Sentence.

14The Applicant attended the Jolly Frog Hotel at Windsor at about 7.00pm with his girlfriend Sonia Lalaji and his flatmate. They registered for the poker tournament being conducted at the Hotel by the victim Ryan Turner who was employed by the Australian Poker League. 

15During the evening the Applicant progressed through the early rounds of the poker competition to the final table which commenced at about 9.30pm with nine players participating. The victim took the role of the dealer on that last table so he could monitor the game. 

16Throughout the evening the Applicant had drunk a number of schooners of beer. 

17During play on the final table the Applicant was heard to swear by the victim. Because swearing was against the rules of the Australian Poker League, the victim gave the Applicant a few cautions. At one point the victim told the Applicant that if he swore again he would be given a ten minute break from the table. 

18A couple of hands later the Applicant won a hand and swore again. The victim allowed him to claim the chips but told him that he had to take time out. The Applicant did not take this with good grace. He purchased another schooner of beer and watched the table from an elevated area of the Hotel. During this time, by virtue of the game rules, the Applicant's chips were played and diminished considerably. 

19At 10.01pm the Applicant was permitted to rejoin the game. The Applicant was forced to bet on the hand and his chips were ""all in"". He lost the hand. The victim said ""unlucky mate"" and started collecting the cards in the middle of the table. The Applicant remained seated at the table and finished his beer. At 10:02pm the Applicant rocked backwards and with his right hand holding the schooner glass he struck the victim on the back of his head. 

20His evidence had been that he did not know that the glass was in his hand. However, the Trial Judge instructed the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant actually knew that he had a glass in his hand at the time he struck the victim and that he deliberately used that glass to strike the victim intending to cause him really serious bodily injury. Her Honour noted that, by its verdict, the jury clearly rejected the Applicant's version that he did not know he had a glass in his hand. It is significant in that regard that the Applicant had offered to plead guilty to the alternative count of reckless wounding, that this offer had been rejected by the Crown, and that the jury found him of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 

21When finding the facts for the purpose of the sentence her Honour found beyond reasonable doubt that when the Applicant struck the victim he did know that he had the glass in his hand and that he deliberately used it to strike the victim intending to cause him grievous bodily harm. She also found that the glass was used to strike the Applicant ""hard, really hard just as intended"" and that a piece of glass flew across the table and hit another player in the forehead. 

22The Applicant then immediately rose to his feet and threw a punch at the victim. The victim responded and threw the Applicant to the ground and a number of other people joined in to hold him down. 

23The victim was ultimately taken to Windsor hospital where he was treated for a deep 10cm long laceration to the occipital scalp. He was kept at the hospital overnight for observation. He has a scar across the bottom of his hairline in line with the bottom of his ear. 

24The Applicant gave evidence at the trial that he had had two light beers at home before attending the Hotel followed by eight to ten schooners during the night. The Sentencing Judge considered that that was an overestimate based on the observation of the CCTV footage, the interview with Police and the evidence of Dr Perl. The Applicant said that he was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the necessary intent required by the charge. Her Honour instructed the jury that they were required to take into account the effect of any alcohol that he had consumed and that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim notwithstanding the evidence in relation to consumption of alcohol by him. Her Honour noted that the jury clearly rejected, as she did, his version that he was so intoxicated that he did not form the necessary intent. 

25Her Honour noted a Victim Impact Statement by Mr Turner which said that he had not recovered any feeling in that part of the area where the scar is situated, apart from a constant freezing cold sensation which is always present. The position of the scar meant that he could no longer comfortably wear a hat. He has been emotionally affected as a result of the assault, suffering sleepless nights. He resigned from working for the Australian Poker League because of his nervousness of being out in places with other people around him. 

Grounds of appeal

Ground 1 - Her Honour's consideration of the standard non-parole period

26Her Honour noted at the outset of her Remarks on Sentence that the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 25 years and that for an offence that fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness where the offender had been convicted after trial there was a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

27Having set out her factual findings including a discussion of the extent of any premeditation and the Applicant's mental state at the time of the offence her Honour went on to say this:

For the reasons I have identified I find the offence to be more than slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but I do not find it to be well below the range as suggested on behalf of the offender. The consequence of this finding is that the standard non-parole period of 7 years does not apply, and is of itself reason in this particular case not to impose such period, however the standard non-parole period does operate as a benchmark or guidepost in the exercise of my sentencing discretion. 

28Her Honour then went on to have regard to the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. 

29The Applicant submits that the course followed by the Sentencing Judge was erroneous in the light of what the High Court said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

30The Applicant argued that the structure of her Honour's consideration of the appropriate penalty suggests that she commenced by determining whether the objective seriousness fell short of the mid-range and then, having decided that it did, concluded that ""the consequence"" was that she should not impose the standard non-parole period. She then went on to consider the subjective features to consider how far below the standard non-parole period she should fix the sentence. This, it was submitted, was a two-stage process proscribed by the High Court in Muldrock at [28].

31This is another in an increasingly long line of cases where sentences imposed prior to the High Court's decision in Muldrock are challenged as falling foul of what was said in that judgment. Some of the cases are collected in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [36] and see also this Court's comments in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 140 at [26]. As Johnson J said in Zreika at [43], it is necessary to read fairly the entirety of a Sentencing Judge's Remarks to see how the standard non-parole period has been dealt with. As in Zreika the Sentencing Judge in the present case determined that the standard non-parole period was only to operate as a benchmark or guidepost in the exercise of her sentencing discretion. It cannot be said that it has been used as a starting point when her Remarks are fairly considered. Her use of the words ""the consequence"" do not lead to the result that it was the starting point. Her approach of using the standard non-parole period as a benchmark or guidepost is consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock: Zreika at [43].

32After this reference to the standard non-parole period her Honour makes no further mention of it. Nor does she in any way relate the sentence she imposed to that standard non-parole period. 

33It was not inappropriate for her Honour to make an assessment of the objective offending according to a scale of seriousness: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [18]-[19]; Zreika at [45] and [47]. 

34Further, in circumstances where her Honour had said that the standard non-parole period did not apply other than as a benchmark or guidepost, that fact that her Honour then went on to consider subjective matters does not bespeak a two-stage approach to sentencing. It is entirely consistent with the correct approach of instinctive synthesis having considered all matters relevant to that synthesis including the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [26]-[28].

35I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 2 - Assessment of objective criminality

36The Applicant submits that her Honour overvalued the objective seriousness of the offence when she found that it was more than slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Applicant submitted that the offending was well below the middle of the range with the most significant factor pointing towards the low end of the range being the degree of seriousness of the victim's injuries. Reference was made to the importance of the outcome in assessing the seriousness of a s 33 offence: R v Mitchell & Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 at [27]. 

37It was submitted that, without minimising what the victim suffered, the injury was relatively minor, he was not hospitalised for an extended time and was not rendered unfit for work for a protracted period. 

38Where an offence lies in the range of criminality or objective seriousness involves an assessment of fact which is within the domain of the Sentencing Judge subject only to error of the House v The King type being established. Her Honour correctly identified, following R v Mitchell & Gallagher at [27], that the result of the offender's conduct is a very important aspect of an offence under s 33. Whilst the particular injury was less grave than many injuries covered by this offence the victim has been left with permanent scarring, permanent loss of proper sensation in the area and a number of emotional sequelae. With her Honour correctly taking into account matters relevant to the injuries and the objective seriousness of the offence no error is demonstrated in her conclusion that the matter is more than slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I would reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 3 - Manifestly excessive

39The Applicant submitted that, in all the circumstances, the sentence imposed was excessive. A number of matters were put forward. To some extent these overlapped with matters associated with the characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence. The Applicant pointed also to the favourable subjective features including the Applicant's remorse, the changes he had made to his life including giving up drinking and gambling, as well as embarking on counselling.

40The Applicant pointed to particular stressors at the time of the offence including the death of his stepfather to whom he was close, the failure of his stepfather's business after the Applicant took it over, a difficult and stressful relationship with his girlfriend, long working hours and indebtedness for various reasons.

41The Sentencing Judge considered all of these matters.

42The Applicant also drew attention to three decisions of this Court, all involving s 33 offences with a glass as the weapon, to demonstrate the severity of the sentence imposed on the Applicant. They were R v Miria [2009] NSWCCA 68, R v Jenkins [2006] NSWCCA 412 and R v Bonett [2009] NSWCCA 135.

43Miria was a Crown appeal where a suspended sentence had been imposed. It pre-dated the abolition of the double jeopardy principle. The Applicant in that case had three prior convictions for violence, two of which were at hotels, and at the time of the subject offence was on a recognizance in respect of the most recent offence. This Court upheld the Crown's appeal and imposed a two year non-parole period with an additional term of two years. In imposing that sentence Grove J (with whom Blanch and Latham JJ agreed) said:

[28] As is well established, the allowing of a Crown appeal against sentence is a circumstance giving rise to restraint on resentence and the new imposition is likely to be less than would have been appropriately imposed at first instance. Resentence will, of course, allow the discount for early plea of guilty as found there.

44The discount given for the guilty plea was said by the sentencing judge to be ""the maximum"". It is reasonable to infer it was 25%. When the discount for the early plea is regarded together with the fact that it was Crown appeal, the case provides little supports for the present Applicant's submission that his sentence was severe.

45Jenkins was also a Crown appeal pre-dating the abolition of the double jeopardy principle. The Applicant was found guilty after trial. The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years. The Applicant had no prior criminal record. The judge found that the Applicant was suffering depression and anxiety at the time of the offence. Although this Court found error in the way the sentencing judge approached the use of the standard non-parole period it declined to uphold the appeal.

46In reaching his view that the appeal should be dismissed Hoeben J (with whom Simpson & Barr JJ agreed) first set out what Wood CJ at CL said of the (then) proper approach to Crown appeals in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. He went on to say:

[35] The sentence passed by his Honour was very lenient and were I passing sentence, I would have imposed a longer non-parole period and a longer balance of sentence. That, however, is not the test. Although I have wavered on this issue, in the end I am satisfied that the sentence passed by his Honour was still within the range of sentences open to his Honour for offences of this kind. For that reason and being mindful of the judicial restraint to be exercised in Crown appeals, I would not interfere with his Honour's sentence.

47Jenkins provides no support for the Applicant's submission that his sentence was severe.
48Bonett was also a Crown appeal. The offender who was already serving a sentence of periodic detention for a glassing offence was convicted after trial of a further offence of glassing for which he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 3 years. The Crown appeal on the basis of manifest inadequacy was not upheld although the sentence was thought to be lenient - see at [38]. As the Applicant acknowledges Bonett was a far more serious case than the present. It is of almost no assistance when considering the severity of the present sentence.

49The Applicant also pointed to the JIRS statistics in relation to this particular offence. These were said to show that 50% of all offenders who received prison sentences received less than 6 year head sentences and 49% of those offenders received non-parole periods less than 3 years.

50Bearing in mind the usual reservations about the use of these statistics, even on the Applicant's own analysis of the statistics it cannot be said to that the sentence imposed on him was outside the range of sentences imposed. In addition, if one examines the statistics for offenders found guilty after trial only 27% received a non-parole period of 3 years or less. The statistics provide no support for the Applicant's contentions.

51The offence is an extremely serious one, demonstrated by the maximum penalty stipulated. This Court can have regard to the prevalence of offences of this type, known colloquially as glassings, when considering the matter of general deterrence as it is bound to do. In Miria at [16] the element of general deterrence was said to loom large for cases of this type. The Applicant had a number of subjective matters in his favour, the sentence imposed was a modest one and well within the appropriate range as judged not only by the statistics but by similar cases where the present offence was charged by reason of glassings in licensed premises.


Conclusion

52In my opinion the following orders should be made:

(1) Leave to appeal granted.

(2) Appeal dismissed.

		23 August 2012",2012-08-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759910,KSC v R [2012] NSWCCA 179,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was tried in the District Court with a jury in relation to 13 counts of sexual assault and one count of common assault that the Crown alleged had been committed between 1997 and 2003. The complainant was the niece of the applicant's wife who had come to live with them. The complainant was 12 years old in 1997 and 18 years old in 2003. The applicant was acquitted in relation to counts 2, 3, 12 and 14. The counts were pleaded as follows: 

1. Between 30 October 1997 and 30 October 1998 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did assault the complainant in circumstances of aggravation, and at a time of the assault committed an act of indecency on the complainant;

2. Between 3 and 9 April 1998 at Yamba in the State of New South Wales did incite the complainant, being a person under the age of 16 years and who was under the authority of the applicant, to commit an act of indecency with the applicant;

3. Between 3 and 9 April 1998 at Yamba in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant a person aged 12 years, in circumstances of aggravation;

4. Between 27 January 1998 and 18 December 1998 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person between the ages of 12 to 13 years, in circumstances of aggravation;

5. Between 27 January 1998 and 18 December 1998 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales committed an act of indecency towards the complainant, a person then under the age of 16 years, and who was under the authority of the applicant;

6. Between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 1999 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person aged 13 years in circumstances of aggravation;

7. Between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 1999 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person aged 13 years in circumstances of aggravation;

8. Between 7 December 1999 and 15 February 2000 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did attempt to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person aged 14 years, in circumstances of aggravation;

9. Between 7 December 1999 and 15 February 2000 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did attempt to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person aged 14 years, in circumstances of aggravation;

10. Between 7 December 1999 and 15 February 2000 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person aged 14 years, in circumstances of aggravation;

11. On or about 7 December 2001 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did assault the complainant;

12. Between 20 December 2002 and 29 December 2002 at Tuncurry in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant who was under the authority of the applicant, without the consent of the complainant and knowing she was not consenting;

13. On or about 13 December 2003 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, who was under the authority of the applicant, without the consent of the complainant and knowing she was not consenting; and

14. On 7 February 2004 at Elderslie in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with the complainant, who was under the authority of the applicant, without the consent of the complainant and knowing she was not consenting.

2Count 1 carried a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment; counts 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment; count 5 a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment; count 11 a maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment; and count 13 a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. Count 13 also carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The applicant was sentenced as follows:


Count 1: a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months, commencing on 16 October 2009 and ending on 15 October 2010;

Count 4: a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years, commencing 16 October 2010 and ending on 15 October 2013;

Count 6 and 7: fixed terms of imprisonment of 3 years, commencing on 16 October 2011 and ending on 15 October 2014;

Counts 8 and 9: fixed terms of imprisonment of 3 years, commencing on 16 October 2012 and ending on 15 October 2015;

Count 10: fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years, commencing on 16 October 2012 and ending on 15 October 2016;

Count 11: fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months, commencing on 16 October 2013 and ending on 15 April 2015;

Count 13: imprisonment for 10 years, commencing on 16 October 2014 and expiring on 15 October 2024, with a non-parole period of 5 years, ending on 15 October 2019.

This resulted in an overall sentence of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years. In sentencing the applicant for count 13, her Honour took into account one offence of accessing child pornography material via a computer, contrary to s 474.19 of the Criminal Code (Cth).

3The appeal was brought out of time and accordingly the applicant seeks leave to overcome this issue. That application was opposed by the Crown, which submitted that the delay was not adequately explained and the lack of merit in the proposed grounds of appeal should lead to the application being refused.

4The jury returned its verdicts on 20 March 2009. However, it was not until 6 November 2009 that the applicant was sentenced. A notice of intention to appeal was filed on 13 November 2009 and expired on 12 May 2010. A notice of application for extension of time to file a notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal was filed 17 months later on 13 October 2011. The application was accompanied by an affidavit from the applicant's solicitor which details difficulties in retaining counsel, complications from another trial of the applicant and difficulties in obtaining a transcript as being responsible for the delays. Although the delay is well beyond that which was appropriate I would not, for that reason alone, deny leave to appeal. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the merit of the proposed grounds of appeal.

5There are further difficulties before leave to appeal is granted. The applicant acknowledges that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to Grounds 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10. The respondent submitted that it also applies to Grounds 3, 6 and 7.

6The applicant must establish that the particular ground is arguable and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted in order for leave to be granted: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at [20]-[24]. In order to establish a miscarriage of justice the applicant must show that he has lost a real chance of acquittal: R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319.

7In Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 Johnson J said at [65]:

""There is no case for the grant of leave under Rule 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the Applicant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the Applicant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319; R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at paragraph 74. The requirements of Rule 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non-direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance of counsel to which he or she is entitled in the increasingly difficult task of giving appropriate directions to the jury: R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at 353 [24]. If a summing up contains an error which could easily have been cured once the judge's attention had been drawn to it, and if the error has caused no miscarriage of justice, it is not appropriate to permit an applicant to seek a new trial on the basis of that error in the hope that he may do better with a different jury. The right to a fair trial operates in favour of both the accused and the Crown which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community: R v Wilson at 353 [24].""

8In Darwiche & Ors v R [2011] NSWCCA 62, with respect to a ground asserting that the trial judge should have stayed the trial of her own motion, the Court (Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreeing) commented upon the significance of Rule 4 and an application for leave at [169]-[170]:

""There are a number of fundamental difficulties with this ground of appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error. The Court determines grounds of appeal, whether relied upon as of right or by leave, in accordance with ss.5 and 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules requires the leave of the Court for a ground of appeal to be taken with respect to a direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing.

The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on the basis of one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536. This ground, and a number of other grounds relied upon by the appellant Darwiche, have the flavour of an 'armchair appeal', where counsel not involved in the trial has gone through the record of the trial in minute detail looking for error or possible arguments without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted: R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; 123 A Crim R 310 at 319-330 [40]-[45]; Ilioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [155]. The appellant Darwiche's first ground is a clear example of such an appeal.""

The Crown case at trial

9The evidence of the complainant was given via a DVD recording made of the evidence she gave at a previous trial.

10The complainant was born on 30 October 1985. Her father passed away in 1987. Her mother changed her address on a number of occasions and developed a mental illness, to the point where she could no longer look after the complainant. At the age of 9 years, the complainant was placed into DOCS care, and on 10 February 1995 was placed with her father's sister, D, and her husband, the applicant, who lived at Elderslie.

11The applicant and D had two sons, M and G and one daughter, K. The youngest of the applicant's children was 6 years older than the applicant. The complainant initially shared a room with K, but within six months, when M moved out of the family home, she moved into M's old bedroom. The complainant stayed in this room when M moved back into the house about 18 months after moving out. The applicant started at St Paul's Catholic Primary School in year 4, and in year 7 began at Elderslie High School. 

12The applicant's house was single storey. There was a hallway that began at the front door and extended down the length of the house. The hallway was divided in the middle by a door. To the left of the front door was a study, then the master bedroom with en suite. On the right was a large lounge/formal dining room. Past the middle door, on the left was the kitchen/dining area, then the rumpus room. On the right was K's bedroom, a bathroom, another bedroom, the complainant's bedroom and a laundry.

13In general, the Crown case was that the applicant had engaged in systematic sexual abuse of the complainant. It was alleged that the applicant had begun to exhibit inappropriate behaviour towards the complainant shortly after the complainant had commenced to live with the applicant and D. 

14About a week after the complainant had moved in, the applicant began to tell the complainant to come and sit on his lap and give him a hug, and he would hug her as well. The complainant said that this made her feel special. On one occasion, when the applicant was reading at his desk in the study and the complainant was sitting on his lap, the applicant began to stroke her upper thigh and rub her vagina on the outside of her underwear. The complainant said that the applicant had a bulge in his jeans while he was touching the complainant and continued to have a normal conversation with her while this was going on. The applicant continued to touch the complainant in this manner at every opportunity. The complainant said that because the complainant enjoyed cuddling the applicant and craved his affection, she did not say anything to anyone about the touching.

15The evidence indicated that the applicant would look at pornography when sitting at the desk with the complainant on his lap. The pornography was stored in the pigeonholes behind the seat. The complainant said that while looking at the pornography, the applicant would slide his hand under the complainant's underwear and rub the inner lips of her vagina. He would have an erection and look up at the sky with a glazed expression on his face. The incidents occurred at times when D was out of the house but also at times when D was home. The door in the middle of the hallway was often closed, making it possible to hear if someone was approaching the study.

16The officer in charge, Detective Sergeant Gregory Lee, found pornographic magazines, including two entitled Velvet and Just 18, during a search of the applicant's premises. Pornographic videos, including one entitled Teenage Sex Wild Party, were also found.

17The complainant would have her bath in the bathroom between the bedrooms. The applicant would often come in and wash the complainant, saying she did not know how to wash herself. When the applicant washed the complainant he would glide his hand along her vagina.

18Some time after the complainant moved into the house, a spa was installed in the en suite bathroom. The complainant would sometimes use it with her friends. When the applicant wanted to use the spa by herself the applicant would go into the bathroom with her. The applicant would touch her vagina over and under her swimming costume. This happened a number of times until the spa broke down.

19Every night the applicant would put the complainant to bed. Often he would put his hands up the complainant's boxer shorts and caress her vagina and insert his finger. The applicant continued to put the complainant to bed during her teenage years. On one occasion when the complainant was about 16, M and his partner, J, were at the house when the applicant was about to put the complainant to bed. J told the complainant that she was too old to be put to bed by the applicant. The complainant then told the applicant that she did not need to be put to bed any more and he replied, ""Aren't I good enough any more"", or ""Too old to be put to bed"" or ""Don't need me anymore"". 

20Evidence about the way in which the applicant's relationship with the complainant developed and early instances of inappropriate touching were relied upon by the Crown as evidence of the context within which the relationship had developed and the charged events occurred. Charges were not laid against the applicant in relation to these acts. 

21The Crown case in relation to the acts that constituted counts 1 - 14 may be summarised as follows:

(1)Count 1 (aggravated indecent assault): On one occasion, when the complainant was 11 or 12 years old, she walked past the master bedroom and the applicant told her to come inside the room. No-one else was home at the time. The applicant told the complainant to lie down and she lay down on the bed next to him. The applicant was watching a pornographic video. The video showed naked women frolicking around a house, and then one woman gave another woman oral sex on a lounge. 

The applicant told the complainant to touch herself. The complainant replied the she did not want to. The applicant was stroking his penis. He said, ""[D] loves women when I stick my fingers up her cunt"". He then told her to enjoy it and to lay back and relax. The applicant touched her vagina. The complainant thought that the touching was above her clothing. She got up and left quickly. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 1. 

(2)Count 2 (aggravated incite act of indecency): During Easter of 1998 the complainant, the applicant and D went for a holiday to Yamba. The complainant was 12 years old. They stayed in a house opposite Pippi Beach. Late one afternoon, the applicant asked the complainant to go fishing with him. D encouraged the complainant to go. The complainant did not wish to go in case something happened, but went anyway. The applicant drove the complainant to a place that the applicant referred to as ""the Point"". The complainant was sitting in the front passenger seat. 

The applicant pulled over to the side of the dirt road. He pulled down his pants, exposing his erect penis. He then said to the complainant ""Go on, kiss it"". The complainant said that she did not want to, and could they just go fishing. They then drove on and went rock fishing for about an hour. 

The applicant was found not guilty of count 2.

(3)Count 3 (aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): After the applicant and the complainant had been rock fishing for about an hour they began to drive back to the house. It was evening. As they were driving the applicant reached across and began to touch the complainant's vagina. He put his hand down her pants and inserted his finger into her vagina. The complainant began to cry and asked him to stop. The applicant told the complainant to stop crying. 

The applicant then pulled into a pub where the applicant had a beer and the complainant had a cola. When they returned to the house at Yamba, D asked whether the complainant had been crying. She said no and went to her room. 

The applicant was found not guilty of count 3. 

(4)Count 4 (aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): When the applicant was 12 years old and in year 7 at school, she had a phone conversation with her friend C. They were talking about a boy at school on whom the complainant had a crush. The complainant heard what sounded like someone picking up another extension of the phone. The complainant said that she wanted to impress the boy and that she would shave her legs and wear her hair out the following day. 

The next morning the complainant was at the table in her summer school uniform. The applicant asked the complainant to sit on his lap. She told him that she did not want to. The applicant said ""Come on, sit on my lap. You are making things harder for yourself"". He also said "" Come on, there you are trying to impress some bloke, got your hair out, shaved your legs"". The applicant grabbed the complainant and sat her on his lap. She tried to get off. The applicant grabbed the complainant by the arm and dragged her into the hallway where he threw her against the wall. The complainant was upset and crying. She slid down the wall. 

The applicant picked the complainant up and threw her onto her bed. The applicant pulled down the complainant's underwear and put his head between her legs. The applicant licked the complainant's vagina. The complainant was screaming, crying and slamming her knees against his head. The applicant told the complainant to ""Shut the fuck up"" and kept going. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 4. 

(5)Count 5 (aggravated act of indecency): The applicant then got up, went to a cupboard in the hallway and got a towel. He knelt by the bed and told the complainant to watch. The applicant masturbated and ejaculated into a towel. The applicant then threw the towel into the laundry

The applicant was found guilty of count 5.

After this incident the complainant knew that she could not avoid the applicant any more. She believed that he would keep molesting her and that if she did not allow it to happen he would become violent. 

(6)Count 6 (aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): In 1999 the complainant began at a new school, St Patrick's. St Patrick's is an all-girls Catholic school. Often when the complainant returned home from school she and the applicant were the only people at home. One day, at the beginning of 1999, the applicant told the complainant to come to the formal lounge/dining room of the house. He told her to take her clothes off. The complainant was lying on the floor directly before the window at the front of the house. The window had drapes that enabled a person in the house to see out, but prevented someone outside the house from seeing in. 

The applicant had his tongue between the complainant's legs and was licking her vagina. The complainant told him that she did not want him to do so but the applicant told her to relax.

The applicant was found guilty of count 6.

(7)Count 7 (aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): The applicant stopped licking the complainant's vagina and asked the complainant to suck on his penis. He took off his pants. His penis was erect. He told her ""I want you to gargle, gargle my sperm and show me that you enjoy it"". The complainant performed oral sex on the applicant and he ejaculated into the complainant's mouth. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 7.

(8)Count 8 (attempted aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): On an occasion during the 1999/2000 Christmas Holidays the applicant offered the complainant a glass of wine, so as to relax her. She told the complainant that she did not want it. The applicant then told the complainant to come to his bedroom. They went into the bedroom and the applicant said ""You're developed enough now...It won't hurt...just relax"". The complainant took off her clothes and lay on the bed. She was upset, crying and repeated ""I don't want to"". The applicant lay on top of the complainant and attempted to put his erect penis inside of her. His attempts were unsuccessful. The applicant went to the en suite and obtained some lubricant. He lubricated his penis and the applicant's vagina. He then attempted to insert his penis into the complaint a second time. The second attempt was also unsuccessful. The complainant was crying and in pain. She squirmed back on the bed and said ""This isn't working"". She then got up, got her clothes and went back to her bedroom. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 8.

(9)Count 9 (attempted aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): On another occasion during the Christmas holidays the applicant asked the complainant to go to the front bedroom of the house and said ""Let's try and have sex again"". The applicant pulled a condom out of his pocket and put lubricant on his penis and the complainant's vagina. He unsuccessfully attempted to insert his penis into the complainant's vagina. The complainant was crying and told the applicant that it hurt and that she wanted him to stop. The applicant attempted to have intercourse with the complainant for approximately 10 minutes. When it was over she went to her bedroom. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 9.

(10)Count 10 (aggravated sexual assault of a child aged between 10 and 16): Later during the 1999/2000 school holidays the applicant was successful in his attempts to penetrate the complainant. The applicant then had intercourse with the complainant until he ejaculated. It lasted for approximately 5 minutes. The complainant was crying and in pain. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 10.

Following this event, the applicant would frequently have sexual intercourse with the complainant. Many of the instances of intercourse were not charged. 

(11)Count 11 (assault): On 30 October 2001, the complainant turned 16 years old. On 6 December 2001 the applicant went to her year 10 formal with a boy, N. The applicant and D drove the complainant and N to the formal and picked them up afterwards. The complainant saw D and the applicant peering through the window at the formal venue while she was resting her arm on N's shoulder before she was picked up. 

The following day the applicant was in a bad mood. Only the complainant and the applicant were at home. The complainant asked the applicant what was wrong. He said ""You're a fucking liar. Piece of shit. You're a cunt. You said that - you said that that bloke was only your friend and I saw you with your arm around him"". The complainant was scared by the applicant's aggressive behaviour. The complainant followed the applicant to the bathroom and tried to hug him to calm him down. 

The applicant told her to get out and shut up. He kicked her down the hallway and into the rumpus room. The applicant then pulled the applicant to the floor and strangled her with his hands around her neck. The applicant said ""I am going to kill you...Fucking liar"". After about 30-60 seconds, the applicant released the complainant. The complainant went into the lounge room and was shaking and crying. The applicant said: ""I am so sorry. I can't believe I did that to someone I love...You are my best friend...I am so sorry for hurting you, I will never do that again, I just went into a white rage"". The complainant told the applicant that if he ever did that again she would leave.

The applicant was found guilty of count 11.

(12)Count 12 (aggravated sexual assault): During the Christmas Holidays in 2002 the complainant, the applicant and D went on holidays to Forster. They stayed in Tuncurry in an apartment. One afternoon during the trip the applicant told D to go for a walk because she needed to start exercising. D went out. 

After D left the applicant tackled the complainant onto the bed in a playful manner. He said ""Come on mate, let's have sex"". The complainant said ""No, I don't want to, I don't want to"". The applicant said ""Come on, come on, it won't take long"". The applicant then had sex with the complainant. The complainant told the applicant to hurry up. The applicant was not crying. When the applicant had finished she went and had a shower.

The applicant was found not guilty of count 12.

(13)Count 13 (aggravated sexual assault): In December 2003 the complainant went to schoolies on the Gold Coast. She returned home at 8:30 pm on Saturday 13 December. No one was home when the complainant unpacked her bags. The applicant arrived home shortly after. The applicant asked the complainant how her trip was and if any men had come back to her room. The applicant smelt of beer. He said ""You have changed. You have met some bloke up in Queensland. You are acting different towards me"". He then said ""Come on mate, come up to the front room"" (the lounge/dining area). She said, ""I don't want to. I hate you and you disgust me"". 

The complainant was crying. The applicant began to have sex with the complainant. The complainant was angry. She scratched the applicant's back and told the applicant that he was disgusting. She told him that he was an old man and that he made her feel sick. The applicant ceased having intercourse with the complainant and told the complainant that she was putting him off. The complainant called the applicant a disgusting paedophile. 

The applicant was found guilty of count 13.

(14)Count 14 (aggravated sexual assault): On 7 February 2004 the complainant was preparing to attend a 21st birthday lunch with her boyfriend, B. The applicant said ""Come on, let's have sex"". No-one else was in the house. The complainant told the applicant that she did not want to. The applicant said ""Come on mate come on"". She said ""I will give you head instead"". The applicant replied ""It's not the same"". The complainant said ""[BH] is coming to pick me up"". The applicant and the complainant then went into the front room and the complainant performed oral sex on the applicant. The applicant ejaculated into the complainant's mouth. The complainant then got ready and left with BH. 

The applicant was found not guilty of count 14.

22The complainant gave evidence that on 20 March 2004, shortly after the events giving rise to count 14, the applicant ""kicked"" the complainant out of the house following an argument. During the course of the argument the applicant threw a bowl of ice cream at the complainant, grabbed her by the neck, pushed her into a corner and tried to strangle her. The complainant made a formal statement to the police about the physical assault. She later made another statement to the police saying that she did not wish proceedings against the applicant in relation to the physical assault to proceed because, though the assault had occurred, the applicant had always been good to her and had never physically abused her before. The complainant gave evidence that she made the later statement because she loved the applicant despite all that had happened, that she felt pressured by the family and that she wanted to move on with her life.

23After leaving home the complainant told a number of people, in general terms, that the applicant had sexually abused her, however the complainant did not make a formal statement to the police about the sexual abuse until May of 2006. 

24There are 10 grounds of appeal against conviction and one ground of appeal against sentence.

Ground 1: The convictions of the [applicant] in relation to counts 1, 4-11 and 13 are unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and in light of the [applicant's] acquittal in respect of [counts] 2 and 3.

25Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a verdict may be set aside if it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The test to be considered when determining if a verdict is unreasonable was recently confirmed by the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14]: 

""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.

In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" (footnotes omitted)

26The Crown case was founded on the evidence of the complainant. Although other witnesses were called, they provided limited evidence in relation to the surrounding circumstances. The Crown case was dependent upon the jury accepting the complainant's evidence. In the course of the directions given by the trial judge her Honour made plain that in order for the jury to return a verdict of guilty for any of the counts on the indictment they would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant's evidence was the truth.

27The jury returned verdicts of guilty with respect to counts 1, 4-11 and 13 and verdicts of acquittal with respect to counts 2, 3, 12 and 14. It was submitted that, as a matter of ""logic and reasonableness"", the acquittals on counts 2 and 3 demonstrated that the jury approached its task in an unreasonable fashion and that, accordingly, the convictions on the remaining counts cannot stand: MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366-368 (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ); R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [6] (Spigelman CJ, Grove J, Carruthers AJ agreeing).

28The applicant accepted that the not guilty verdicts for counts 12 and 14 can be reasonably explained on the basis that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the acts giving rise to those counts. In the course of their deliberations the jury sent a question to her Honour seeking elaboration about the legal definition of consent. At the time the events in counts 12, 13 and 14 took place the applicant was over the age of 16. Accordingly, consent was a significant issue in relation to those counts at trial. I am satisfied that the verdicts in relation to counts 12 and 14 can be explained by the fact that the jury were not satisfied in relation to the issue of consent. The verdicts of acquittal in relation to these counts do not form part of the applicant's argument under this ground of appeal. 

29The applicant submitted that there was no logical basis on which the verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 2 and 3 could be reconciled with the guilty verdicts in relation to the other counts. 

30It was submitted that the complainant's evidence in relation to each count was detailed and that there was no apparent difference in the quality of her evidence on any particular count: AE v R [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [35] (Bell JA, Hulme and Latham JJ).

31The applicant emphasised that he had given evidence denying any sexual interaction with the complainant. Furthermore, he had said that it would be physically impossible for him to digitally penetrate the complainant because of the fact that following an accident his right wrist had restricted movement and his left wrist does not actually have a wrist joint.

32It was submitted by the applicant that the evidence in relation to the counts upon which he was convicted was of events that were not linked to a specific time or location, making it practically impossible for the applicant to adduce evidence to refute those allegations with any precision. However, it was submitted that when the complainant's evidence was referable to a specific time or event (as was the case with her evidence in relation to counts 2 and 3) and there was positive evidence refuting her evidence, the jury returned a not guilty verdict. This, it was submitted, raised concerns that the jury had improperly cast a burden of proof upon the applicant: R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 at [122] (Simpson J, McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreeing). It was submitted that once the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the veracity and accuracy of the complainant's evidence on counts 2 and 3, it must reasonably have harboured similar doubts in relation to the remaining counts.

33The applicant submitted that it could not be said that the Crown case in relation to counts 1 and 4-10 was any stronger than in relation to counts 2 and 3. There was no additional evidence that was capable of corroborating the complainant's account: see Moffitt v R [2002] NSWCCA 73 at [11] (Stein JA). It was submitted that such additional evidence as there was went to peripheral matters. Accordingly, it was submitted that there was no evidential basis for distinguishing between the various counts. The applicant invited consideration of R v Fry [2002] NSWCCA 127 at [18]-[19] where Ipp AJA said:

""Implicit in the appellant's acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant's account of the events which were said to give rise to that count. There are a number of possibilities which may have led to the jury acquitting the appellant on the second count. Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury's rejection of the complainant's account on the second count diminished his overall credibility. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of his evidence concerning the incident, the subject of the second count.

It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first count. There is nothing in the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that his evidence was more reliable in relation to the first count than it was in relation to the second count.""

The applicant also referred to Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 455 where Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said:

""[N]othing in the complainant's evidence gave any ground for thinking that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the first and third count than it was in respect of the second count. When the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, the convictions on the first and third counts can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.""

34It was further submitted that the verdict could not be explained on the basis that the jury was unwilling to place reliance upon the complainant's memory of events related to counts 2 and 3 because her memory may have been distorted by the passage of time. The jury accepted the complainant's evidence in relation to count 1. The applicant submitted that the events giving rise to this count must have preceded the events giving rise to counts 2 and 3. This submission is not strictly correct. The events giving rise to count 1 were alleged to have occurred between the dates of 30 October 1997 and 30 October 1998. The events giving rise to counts 2 and 3 were alleged to have occurred at a time that fell within the time period specified for count 1, namely between 3 and 9 April 1998. However, regardless of the specific dates, it is plain that the events giving rise to each of the three counts were alleged to have taken place within a similar time frame. Accordingly, it was submitted that the jury must have been satisfied that the complainant was able to recollect events which dated back to the time when counts 2 and 3 were said to have occurred.

35It was submitted that the apparent ability of the complainant to recollect events was borne out by the manner in which she gave evidence. The applicant referred to R v RCC [2002] NSWCCA 347; (2002) 133 A Crim R 352 at [7] where Sully J said:

""[The count] alleged, once again, an episode of violent conduct, the incidents of which were clear, uncomplicated and vivid. Once again, there was... no room for a supposition that the complainant was honestly mistaken in her recollection of, and in her recounting of, the incidents particular to the count.""

36The applicant emphasised that the evidence given by the complainant in relation to counts 2 and 3 was of a similar standard to the evidence the complainant gave in respect of the other counts: R v Qin [2008] NSWCCA 189; R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82, 101 Spigelman CJ, quoted with approval in R v Parbery (2003) 141 A Crim R 43, 55 at [42] per Buddin J:

""There are cases in which nothing at all appears to differentiate the complainant's evidence, which the jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt, from the evidence which the jury did not so accept. In such a case the MacKenzie test of ""logic and reasonableness"" is not satisfied.""

37Furthermore, it was submitted that it could not be said that there was any distinction in the way in which the various allegations were reported, or the complaints made. It has been accepted that consistency of the allegations made by a complainant in relation to one offence rather than another may explain why a jury convicts an accused in relation to the former, but acquits in relation to the latter: see R v JJT (unreported, NSWCCA, 3 December 1997) at 6 (Gleeson CJ). However, again it was submitted that in the applicant's case the various counts could not be distinguished on this basis.

38It was further submitted that short of the positive evidence that the applicant was able to put forward in relation to counts 2 and 3, there was no distinction between the various counts. All counts involved sole reliance upon the complainant's account, which was flatly denied by the applicant. As Sully J said in Sgardelis v R [2006] NSWCCA 338 at [51]-[52]:

""[T]he trial was conducted both by the Crown and by the defence in completely clear and completely consistent terms respectively; and those competing cases were starkly and diametrically opposed. There were no shades of grey in either of the competing cases. One was a case of clear and consistent refusal of consent; the other was a case of clear and consistent consent; or, at the very least, a reasonable, clear and consistent perception of clear and consistent consent.

I acknowledge, of course, that the jury was not bound to accept either the whole of the complainant's evidence or the whole of the appellant's case at trial. I apprehend, however, that the triteness of that proposition ought not to be permitted to obscure the need for a jury when accepting part only of a particular body of evidence to discriminate upon the basis of reason rather than that of raw intuition.""

39It was submitted that it could not be said that ""the jury may have formed the view that a verdict of guilty on the main count was sufficient to reflect the applicant's culpability"": Rylands v R [2008] NSWCCA 106; (2008) 184 A Crim R 534 at [48] (Mason P) citing with approval R v Markuleski at [75]-[77] (Spigelman CJ), at [227]-[230] (Wood CJ at CL); MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [34] (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ). It was submitted that counts 2 and 3 each related to one of numerous incidents alleged by the complainant and it could not be said that the conduct was encompassed in the remaining charges, particularly in the light of the fact that count 3 represented the first allegation of sexual intercourse. Given the age of the complainant, this was a particularly serious allegation. The applicant accepted that it was significantly more serious than the first count (which, by comparison, alleged a ""mere touching"") and of which the applicant was convicted. There would also be no reason why the jury would perceive counts 2 and 3 to be less serious than, for instance, counts 4 and 5. Similarly, nor could it be said that the particular acquittals were as a result of a compromise on the part of the jury: R v TK at [133]-[134] (Simpson J).

40In conclusion, it was submitted that there is no ""proper way by which"" the acquittals on counts 2 and 3 can be reconciled with the convictions on the remaining counts: Mackenzie v The Queen at 366 (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ).

41In arriving at this conclusion, it was submitted that it was appropriate to have regard to a number of other features of the case. In R v Bonat [2004] NSWCCA 240 Sperling J said at [116]:

""Having regard to the totality of relevant factors - the factually inconsistent verdicts, the complainant's evidence being wholly uncorroborated, the discrepancies in the complainant's evidence, the delay in complaint and the appellant's unshaken denials - the convictions do not stand the test of logic and reasonableness required by the authorities.""

42It was submitted that this case exhibits many of the same features as Bonat. In particular the applicant emphasised that on 20 March 2004, the complainant attended the police station, stating the applicant had assaulted her. When giving a statement two days later the complainant said ""[the applicant] has always been good to me and has never physically abused me before"". The applicant submitted that this statement is highly significant as the complainant had moved out of the applicant's house by the time the statement was made and would no longer have been under a compulsion to conceal the applicant's alleged wrong-doing. However, the allegations of sexual assault were only made some 2 years later, in May 2006.

43Therefore, it was submitted that verdicts of acquittal should be entered in relation to each count of which the applicant was convicted.

Conclusion on Ground 1

44It is not uncommon for juries to bring in different verdicts in relation to particular counts when a series of alleged sexual assaults are prosecuted. Where it is submitted that the inconsistency of verdict bespeaks a failure in the jury to properly discharge its obligations, it is important to appreciate that there is no general rule that where prosecution of several offences depends upon the testimony of the complainant, acquittal on one or more counts compels a conclusion that the jury must necessarily have regarded the complainant generally as an untruthful witness or that her credibility was undermined in respect of the counts on which they have convicted: MFA v The Queen at [35] (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ commenting on misconceptions arising from the judgment in Jones v The Queen). The circumstances of a particular case may justify different verdicts: McKenzie v The Queen at [397] (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ). 

45As I said in TK v R at [6]-[7]:

""It seems to me that there are problems in an appellate court concluding that because a jury does not convict on one or more counts any conclusion as to the general creditworthiness of a complainant can be drawn. As the judgments in Markuleski point out there may be many reasons why a jury does not convict on a particular count. The High Court has been careful to emphasise that an appellate court must allow for the advantage of the jury when considering questions arising under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The most significant advantage is assumed to be that of observing the witness as they give their evidence. It is a very significant step to conclude that the reason for the jury's decision to acquit on any count is that they were so unable to accept the complainant's evidence on that count that her evidence was not capable of founding a conviction on another count. The consequence of such a decision by an appellate court is that the jury has not been faithful to the fundamental directions from the trial judge, namely that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt on each count. As the law presumes that the jury has been faithful to a trial judge's directions (HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 245 ALR 204 per Kirby J at [52]; Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 420 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J), the starting point for any analysis must assume that this is so. The burden of satisfying the appellant court that there has been a miscarriage of justice rests upon the appellant.

It is important to remember when considering the problem of inconsistent verdicts that a jury does not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all of a complainant's evidence is an accurate or even truthful account of all of the facts relevant to all of the counts. It may be, and in fact may often be the case, that a complainant's recollection of a sequence of events over time will contain inaccuracies, internal contradictions or other imperfections which leave a jury unsure about the Crown case on particular counts. As Wood CJ at CL pointed out in Markuleski, a complainant, concerned that she may not be believed, may exaggerate or embellish her account of particular events. It may be that, having been reminded of the problems of uncorroborated evidence by the trial judge, before a jury convicts on any count where the primary evidence is of the complainant, it will seek out matters in the surrounding evidence which are consistent with the complainant's account. It may also be that where the jury finds amongst the surrounding evidence that there are some inconsistencies with the complainant's evidence it will be unable to return a guilty verdict on a particular count.""

46Counts 2 and 3 were alleged to have occurred during the period from 3 April to 9 April 1998 at Yamba. This placed them in a short time frame and at a specific location. In his closing address defence counsel pointed out the ""problems"" with the complainants evidence in respect of these counts including that:


the complainant said they went fishing to a place called the Point, but there was no place of that name at Yamba - only at Forster (where the applicant said they had been on holidays on another occasion);

the complainant was unable to identify the road leading to the beach at Yamba from photographs and a DVD 'drive-thru"" by police;

the complainant thought the area shown in exhibit 4 looked like the area which she claimed was Yamba (whereas it was actually a photograph of Forster); and

the applicant and D gave evidence that the complainant had not been fishing with the applicant during the trip to Yamba in April 1998.

47In her summing up, the trial judge emphasised these issues and told the jury on five occasions that in order to convict the applicant of either count 2 or count 3 they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each occurred between the dates 3 April to 9 April 1998 and at Yamba. 

48I am satisfied that the explanation for the acquittals on counts 2 and 3 is that the jury believed that the complainant had made a mistake as to the time and most likely the place where the alleged events occurred. The verdicts of not guilty do not mean that the jury concluded that the alleged events did not happen. Rather, I believe that the jury concluded that they may well have happened but at a different location or at a different time.

49It follows that, although the jury acquitted in relation to counts 2 and 3, the verdicts on the other counts should not be set aside for this reason. There was evidence in relation to each of the other counts that the jury was entitled to accept. The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing all of the evidence and it is plain from the verdicts that they gave close attention to their task. A reading of the transcript leaves me without any doubt that the jury were entitled to accept the complainant's account of each of the counts upon which the applicant was convicted. 

50I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal. 

Ground 2: In directing the jury on the forensic disadvantage suffered by the [applicant], as a result of the delay in the making of the complaint, her Honour erred in that she framed the direction in the form of mere comment, rather than as a warning.

51The trial that is the subject of this appeal was the applicant's second trial for the pleaded counts. It commenced on 23 February 2009. This Court has previously determined that when a trial commences after 1 January 2009 s 165B of the Evidence Act controls the directions that the trial judge must give in relation to delay: GG v R [2010] NSWCCA 230; (2010) 79 NSWLR 194 at (Beazley JA, Buddin J and Barr AJ agreeing). 

52Section 165B is in the following terms:

""165B Delay in prosecution

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding in which there is a jury.

(2) If the court, on application by a party, is satisfied that the defendant has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay, the court must inform the jury of the nature of that disadvantage and the need to take that disadvantage into account when considering the evidence.

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in informing the jury of the nature of the significant forensic disadvantage suffered and the need to take that disadvantage into account, but the judge must not in any way suggest to the jury that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict the defendant solely because of the delay or the forensic disadvantage suffered because of the consequences of the delay.

(5) The judge must not warn or inform the jury about any forensic disadvantage the defendant may have suffered because of delay except in accordance with this section, but this section does not affect any other power of the judge to give any warning to, or to inform, the jury.

(6) For the purposes of this section: 
(a) delay includes delay between the alleged offence and its being reported, and
(b) significant forensic disadvantage is not to be regarded as being established by the mere existence of a delay.

(7) For the purposes of this section, the factors that may be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a) the fact that any potential witnesses have died or are not able to be located,
(b) the fact that any potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable.""

53It follows that a trial judge must not in any way suggest to the jury that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict the defendant solely because of delay (sub-section 4) and must not give a direction otherwise than as provided for by the section (sub-section 5). However, if the court is satisfied that delay has occasioned a significant forensic disadvantage to an accused the court must inform the jury of the nature of the disadvantage and instruct them of the need to take that into account when considering the relevant evidence (sub-section 2).

54Accordingly, any direction relating to a delay that has occasioned a significant forensic disadvantage to the applicant was required to be the subject of a direction pursuant to s 165B of the Evidence Act 1995. 

55At the trial the terms of an appropriate direction were discussed by the trial judge with counsel and the form of the direction to be given was ultimately agreed between them. The direction the trial judge gave was in the following terms:

""There is a further direction that I must give you relating to this issue of delay, the delay in complaint being made by the complainant. It is most important that you appreciate fully the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself in relation to some of these counts by testing the prosecution evidence or by bringing forward evidence in his own case to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt.""

56Later in the course of her summing up the trial judge said:

""Because the accused has been put into this situation of significant disadvantage he has been prejudiced in the conduct of his defence. As a result you must give the prosecution case, for these counts that I have referred to, most careful scrutiny before you could consider returning any verdict of guilty. In carrying out that scrutiny you must bear in mind the matters that I have been speaking about. The fact that the complainant's evidence has not been tested to the extent that it otherwise could have been and the inability of the accused to bring forward evidence, or challenge it, or to support his own defence.""

57Notwithstanding the amendment introducing s 165B of the Evidence Act the submissions by the applicant in relation to this ground of appeal appear to have assumed that the trial was not to be conducted in accordance with that provision. The submissions emphasised the statements by this Court in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60; (2002) 54 NSWLR 241; Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161; JJB v R [2006] NSWCCA 126; (2006) 161 A Crim R 187. In each of these cases emphasis was placed on the need for a ""warning"" to be given and not simply a comment or caution. Spigelman CJ commented upon the strictures of this approach in DRE v R [2006] NSWCCA 280; (2006) 164 A Crim R 400.

58Before this Court it was submitted that although the word ""warning"" need not be used (TJ v R [2009] NSWCCA 257; (2009) 76 NSWLR 167), the need to ""warn"" was not properly satisfied by the trial judge telling the jury that evidence must be scrutinised with great care: Sheehan v R [2006] NSWCCA 233; (2006) 163 A Crim R 397 at [115]-[116] (Kirby J).

59I reject the submissions of the applicant. In the present case the form of direction that the trial judge gave was appropriate and in accordance with a direction which trial counsel accepted as adequately responding to the situation. I am not persuaded there is any substance to this ground of appeal and would refuse leave to appeal under Rule 4.

Ground 3: when directing the jury on the manner in which it could take into account so called ""context evidence"" her Honour erred in referring to such acts as ""uncharged acts"".

60The Crown led evidence of a number of acts alleged by the complainant that were not the subject of individual counts. The evidence was admitted as being necessary to establish the context in which the matters the subject of the charges were alleged to have occurred. In directing the jury in relation to the evidence of matters other than the matters alleged in the indictment the trial judge said:

""You cannot reasonably say 'look we are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about one or all of the specific charges brought by the Crown because we do not think the evidence proves them but we think he committed one of these uncharged other acts so we will convict him of one of the specific offences in substitution, even though we are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence actually establishes that he committed that specifically charged offence.""

61The applicant complained about the use of the word ""uncharged"". It was submitted that it was ""ill chosen"".

62In HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [129] Hayne J remarked that it would usually ""be better not to describe the evidence of other events of a sexual kind as evidence of 'uncharged acts'"". His Honour said:

""Uncharged acts suggest that what is described could have been the subject of charges. That may not be right. The conduct described may not be criminal; the description of the conduct may not be sufficiently specific to found a charge. Describing the events as 'uncharged acts' may invited speculation about why no charges were laid.""

63Kiefel J said at [492] that:

""It may not be desirable for a trial judge to describe the acts as 'uncharged' to a jury since it may convey a view, on the part of the judge, that they were proper subject for charges.""

64It is clear from the remarks of Hayne and Kiefel JJ in HML that their Honours would prefer that expression ""uncharged acts"" was not used during a trial. However, the other judges in HML did not express that view and it would seem that there is no considered view that the use of the expression constitutes an error: see Gleeson CJ at [1] and Crennan J at [399]. For my own part, I believe it preferable not to use the expression. It carries with it the clear implication that the ""other acts"" could have been the subject of charges but were not, which may invite a jury to speculate as to why they were not charged and in this way distract them from considering the charges that were preferred. 

65In the present case the trial judge used the expression only once during the course of detailed directions about the manner in which the jury should approach evidence of the relationship between the complainant and the applicant. In the course of those directions, in contrast to the single reference to uncharged acts, the trial judge referred to ""other acts"" on 22 occasions.

66As it happens, the jury acquitted the applicant of four of the counts. It must follow that the jury were not diverted from their task by the single reference to ""uncharged acts"".

67Trial counsel perceived no problem in the directions given by her Honour. I would not grant leave pursuant to Rule 4 in relation to this ground of appeal. 

Ground 4: Her Honour erred in permitting evidence of the assault of the complainant by the [applicant] on 20 March 2004 to be adduced even though:
(a) the prosecution failed to comply with the notice requirements set out in s 97(1)(a) Evidence Act 1995;
(b) the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unproved prejudice to the [applicant]; or alternatively
(c) the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect.

Ground 5: Her Honour erred in failing to direct the jury adequately, or at all, on the manner in which the evidence of the assault on 20 March 2004 could be taken into consideration by the jury. 

68It is appropriate to consider Ground 4 and Ground 5 together. 

69The first trial of the applicant ended without the jury being able to agree as to the appropriate verdict. In accordance with the procedures set out in s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, a DVD of the complainant's evidence at the first trial was played in the course of the second trial. As part of her evidence the complainant recounted an alleged assault on her by the applicant on 20 March 2004.

70The prosecution disclaimed any use of the evidence as tendency evidence. Instead it was relied upon to indicate the ""context"" in which the charges arose. It was submitted by the applicant that the evidence occasioned an injustice to the applicant because its relevance was never rigorously evaluated in accordance with the obligation of the trial judge as explained in DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; (2008) 200 A Crim R 206 at [29] (McClellan CJ at CL); Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; (2006) 171 A Crim R 463 at [80] (McClellan CJ at CL); R v ATM (2000) NSWCCA 475 at [72] (Howie J).

71It was further submitted that although the trial judge gave the jury directions in relation to other alleged incidents of sexual assault and the care with which the jury must approach those matters, similar directions were not given in relation to the evidence of the assault that allegedly occurred on 20 March 2004. It was submitted that the directions that were given did not extend to the use that could be made of the evidence of the assault.

72It was submitted that the only basis upon which the evidence could have been admitted was that it provided evidence of the applicant displaying jealous behaviour when the complainant formed a relationship with a boy. In the course of his address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor emphasised the jealousy that the applicant had demonstrated towards the complainant forming this relationship.

73It was submitted that evidence of jealousy is tantamount to what has been referred to as ""motive evidence"" which was discussed by Hodgson JA in ES v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 197 at [38]-[40]:

""Where a person is charged with one or more sexual offences against a child, evidence of uncharged inappropriate sexual contact between the accused and that child can have probative value. In my opinion, there are (at least theoretically) three broad ways in which it can do so: 

(1) As context evidence (so that the charged acts are not seen unrealistically as being isolated); 

(2) As motive evidence (disclosing a sexual interest in the complainant that could motivate the charged acts); and 

(3) As tendency evidence (disclosing a tendency to have a particular state of mind and/or to act in a particular way, including a tendency to act on the sexual interest that the accused has). 

However, although there is in my opinion a theoretical distinction between categories (2) and (3) (see Leonard v R [2006] NSWCCA 267; (2006) 67 NSWLR 545 at [48]-[67], HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [155]-[158] per Hayne J, [273]-[279] per Heydon J), and although motive evidence as such is not subject to the requirements of s 97 of the Evidence Act, it is not practical to maintain that distinction in the case of the sexual interest of an adult in a child. This is (a) because the existence of that interest can be considered itself to manifest a tendency to have a particular state of mind, (b) because the uncharged acts will generally ipso facto have manifested a tendency to act on that interest, and (c) because the very powerful effect of tendency reasoning would be very likely to swamp any effect of motive reasoning: cf Leonard at [68], [101]. 

Consistently with this, it is now well established that if evidence of uncharged acts is to be used in such cases in any way other than as context evidence, then the requirements for tendency evidence need to be satisfied: Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; (2006) 171 A Crim R 463; DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272."" 

74There is a significant distinction between the issues with which Hodgson JA was concerned and the present controversy. The acts which Hodgson JA referred to as ""uncharged acts"" were of sexual activity which his Honour concluded will generally have manifested a tendency for an accused to act on a sexual interest towards the complainant. As a consequence, although it may be described as motive evidence, it is in reality tendency evidence, which his Honour concluded necessarily had to be dealt with in accordance with the ""rules"" in respect of such evidence.

75The evidence in the present case was of a physical assault devoid of sexual activity. As it happens, defence counsel sought to use this evidence to his advantage. No objection was taken to it and it is plain that he took this course because he wished to draw attention to the circumstances in which the complainant first approached the police about the applicant. In his opening defence counsel said:

""As the Crown said it is not in dispute that the complainant never alleged any sort of sexual misconduct against the accused until well after the March 2004 event which I will speak to you of in a moment. It is not in dispute that she was given an opportunity, you will hear evidence that she spoke to a number of people, that she spoke to a school counsellor, that she spoke to someone at Camden Hospital, pay particular attention to what she said to them and what she didn't say to them. It is not in dispute that she spoke to a doctor. All these opportunities were there and even on the Crown case there was no suggestion at that particular stage.""

76Later, in his opening remarks defence counsel said of the evidence:

""The Crown I suggest made reference to that because they know that it is a significant piece of evidence that you will need to consider because it stands in stark contradiction to her later allegations which don't arise until after this.""

77The Crown Prosecutor did link the assault to alleged jealousy by the applicant of the relationship that the complainant was forming with her boyfriend. When the applicant was challenged about this, his response to the Crown Prosecutor's question was: ""I was upset about [the complainant's boyfriend] sneaking into my house; that's all"".

78The Crown Prosecutor argued that the circumstances of the alleged assault in March 2004 bore a remarkable similarity to the incident which constituted count 11 in the indictment. The Crown Prosecutor linked the assault to the proposition that the applicant had a controlling and jealous attitude towards the complainant. It was said that this was generated by the fact that the applicant was having sexual intercourse with the complainant on an ongoing basis over a long period of time.

79It was submitted that the similarities between the events which allegedly occurred on 20 March 2004 and count 11 created a considerable risk of prejudice to the applicant. Photographs of the complainant's injuries were tendered, which, it was submitted, were likely to increase the risk of prejudice.

80The applicant also complained to this Court that the Crown had inappropriately cross examined the applicant and suggested to him that he was a violent person prone to rage in relation to the complainant. It was submitted that, as a consequence, there was a risk that the jury would have employed propensity reasoning in that it may have concluded that the applicant was prepared to use violence. It was submitted that this reasoning may have led to a conclusion that the applicant was prepared to employ violence in order to procure the complainant to perform sexual acts against her will. Accordingly, it was submitted that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. It was further submitted that, although the jury were warned against the use of other sexual acts as tendency evidence, it was not warned that it could not use the evidence of the assault on 20 March 2004 in this manner.

81To my mind, the events of 20 March 2004 and the complaint to the police that followed were an integral part of the context of the various charges. 

82It is plain that rather than object to the tender of the evidence defence counsel sought to turn it to the applicant's advantage. It may be that the evidence reflected jealousy toward the complainant's boyfriend. However, it was also capable of significantly influencing the jury's attitude toward the complainant and the veracity of her evidence. Given the tactical need for material with which to damage the complainant's credit, this evidence provided the applicant with a significant forensic opportunity. So much is plain from the directions of the trial judge which included the following:

""It was also put to you on behalf of the accused that further, there did not seem to be any evidence of those who were members of the household, noticing any injuries sustained by the complainant at the time, which you might have thought would have been seen if the events as described by her, which it is argued, were described to be fairly violent episode towards her, if such events had occurred as alleged. For all of more general reasons about your assessment of the complainant, it is argued that you would not accept her as a witness of truth in relation to that event, at the very least you would have a reasonable doubt and a sense of unease.

You are also reminded of course, and I have taken you to this already, that when she did leave the home after the events of 20 March 2004, which was in fact an admitted episode of physical violence by the accused towards her and went to the police two days later and made the complainant that she did about that episode of physical violence, that she subsequently, having asked the police not to proceed with the charge against him, said in her statement, I have already put this to you, 'that [the applicant] has always been good to me and has never physically hurt me before.' You are reminded that that, at the very least, is a significantly inconsistent statement compared with what is said to be this fairly major episode of violence occurring on 7 December 2001.""

83The applicant's counsel did not seek any redirection in relation to this issue. This is not surprising. The events of 20 March 2004 were not challenged by the applicant who sought the advantage that he had by distinguishing those events from the alleged sexual assault. Furthermore, that event was followed by the complainant making a report to police before later requesting that the police withdraw the charge on the basis that the applicant had not hurt her previously.

84In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that there is substance to either Ground 4 or Ground 5. I would refuse leave pursuant to Rule 4 to raise either ground of appeal.

Ground 6: Her Honour erred in failing to caution the jury, at or about the time at which DVDs of the complainant's evidence were played, against using evidence of uncharged, sexual acts as tendency evidence.

85As I have previously indicated, the complainant's evidence was given by the playing of a DVD of the evidence she had previously given. That DVD contains the directions given by the previous trial judge including warnings with respect to the impermissible use of evidence as tendency evidence. Defence counsel drew this to her Honour's attention before the DVD was played and indicated that he personally did not ""particularly like those sort of directions but it's a direction which was appropriate and was given with the (imprimatur) of previous trial counsel"".

86Her Honour responded that she was not inclined to interrupt the DVD to give further directions as she was of the view that the evidence needed to flow. Her Honour acknowledged that there were difficulties about evidence being given in this way and, in particular, that if the equipment was turned off there would be a 30 second delay in turning it on. The matter was not again raised by defence counsel and the evidence was played.

87Later, her Honour addressed the jury at length about the use they could make of ""the evidence of other acts"". Counsel for the applicant in this Court conceded that her Honour's directions were unobjectionable, but it was submitted they were not capable of remedying the failure to give appropriate directions at the time the evidence was given. 

88It is plain that the trial judge faced practical difficulties with the playing of the DVD and the efficient and effective management of the trial. The course that her Honour took ensured that the jury were aware of the care with which the evidence should be approached having regard to the directions given by the previous trial judge. Her Honour discussed this issue with counsel and there was no complaint made as to the course that her Honour proposed to take and which ultimately she followed.

89Although not ideal, the direction that her Honour ultimately gave adequately emphasised the directions that the jury were already aware from viewing the DVD. In the absence of complaint at the trial, I am not satisfied that any miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the course taken. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. It is not necessary to consider whether Rule 4 applies. 

Ground 7: Her Honour erred in failing to direct the jury adequately that evidence of prior, uncharged sexual acts could be used only to demonstrate that the charged acts were not isolated incidents and not as evidence of a tendency by the [applicant] to groom the complainant.

90The need to warn the jury in clear terms that they cannot apply tendency reasoning to context evidence has been addressed by this court on a number of occasions; Qualteri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; (2006) 171 A Crim R 463; DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; (2008) 200 A Crim R 206. In DJV I said at [29]-[31]:

""In Qualteri at [112] this Court emphasised the necessity for a trial court to ensure that it critically analyses attempts by the prosecution to tender evidence otherwise than as tendency evidence. It must again be emphasised that it is not relevant merely because it discloses aspects of the relationship between an accused and a complainant. There must be an issue which the evidence may explain or resolve by placing the alleged events in their true context.

The need for care in identifying the basis upon which the evidence is admitted, either tendency or context, must be emphasised. In HML, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Keifel JJ state (see Hayne J at [247]) that where evidence is tendered to prove a propensity, being the sexual interest of an accused in a complainant, the jury must be told that they must be satisfied of that interest beyond reasonable doubt (see also Howie J in Toki [2000] NSWSC 999; (2000) 116 A Crim R 536; R v Hagerty [2004] NSWCCA 89; (2004) 145 A Crim R 138; Gipp at [76]; R v TAB [2002] NSWCCA 274; R v RNM [2005] NSWCCA 396. In MM [2000] NSWCCA 78; (2000) 112 A Crim R 519, this Court divided on the question). The four members of the High Court who reached this conclusion may not be entirely consistent in their reasoning (see Kirby J at [61] and Keifel J at [505]-[506]) and HML was decided having regard to the common law. However, unless after full argument of the issue this Court or the High Court says otherwise, this Court should accept that in sexual assault cases the appropriate standard of proof of tendency evidence is beyond reasonable doubt. 

Context evidence does not require a direction that it be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where the evidence is of similar sexual misconduct but the jury are told it has only been admitted to explain aspects of the relationship and they may not use the evidence to reason toward guilt, the expectation that they will understand and remain faithful to the direction may not be on firm ground: see Kirby J in HML at [57]. To be told that the accused did the same thing on a number of other occasions but that you cannot use that evidence to reason that he did it on a particular occasion is contrary to ordinary human experience (see the discussion by Debelle J in R v M, RB [2007] SASC 207; (2007) 172 A Crim R 73 at [63] ff). The jury must be left in no doubt that they cannot follow that line of reasoning. The risk in a particular case of an impermissible course of reasoning by the jury which cannot be averted by directions must be a consideration when determining whether the evidence should be admitted."" 

91The applicant submitted that the warning that her Honour gave against using the evidence of other acts as tendency evidence failed to limit the use of the evidence in that way. In support of this submission the applicant drew attention to part of the summing up which was in the following terms:

""It is important that I explain to you the relevance of this evidence of other acts. It was admitted solely for the purpose of placing the complainant's evidence of the particular acts charged against the accused by the Crown, to put the charges in the indictment into what the Crown says is a realistic context. That context, the Crown argued to you, was one of increasing sexual contact initiated by the accused towards the complainant from shortly after she came to live with them right up until the time of the first specific counts in the indictment, count 1, in circumstances where he was persuading her that such behaviour was normal, desensitising her to sexualised behaviour and, on the Crown argument, grooming her so that she would engage in that behaviour with him.""

92Although the applicant did not refer to it, in the portion of the summing up which immediately followed her Honour both developed the direction and provided the jury with appropriate warnings in relation to the use of the evidence. Her Honour said:

""On behalf of the accused it is argued that, far from seeing this evidence of other acts as providing some sort of realistic context in which to understand the evidence of specific counts, you would find the complainant's account of these other acts as generally being quite unrealistic as evidence seeking to establish the context which has been referred to on behalf of the accused as being either unreal or surreal.

However, what ever you might make of both of those arguments from the Crown and from the accused, that is the basis upon which the evidence is before you, that is to prove, or to establish, context and that is the only basis on which the evidence of other acts has been admitted. Otherwise you may wonder about the likelihood of apparent isolated acts over 9 years occurring suddenly without any apparent reason. If the complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of sexual misconduct you might be entitled to think that it was very odd for there to be such isolated acts between those persons. If you had not heard the allegations that I am talking about, you may have thought that the complainant's evidence was less credible. Of course it goes without saying for it to have that flavour and for it to be used in that way, you would have to accept the complainant's evidence of these acts as being truthful and reliable. 

If, however, the particular acts charged are placed in what is said to be the wider context, ie the context of what is alleged to be an ongoing history, then that feature would disappear. It is for that reason that the law permits a wider sexual history to be provided. It is to avoid artificiality or unreality in the presentation of the evidence. Therefore it is open to the Crown to lead evidence of other alleged acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant, even though they are not the subject of specific charges.

However, I must give you some important warnings with regard to this evidence of other acts which are admitted into evidence, as they are here only to prove a context. You must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of the type charged. In other words you must not reason or say to yourself, well if he did all these other things that the complainant alleges then he must be the sort of person who behaves in this way so he must have committed the specific charges alleged in the indictment. You must not substitute the evidence of these other acts for the evidence required to establish the specific offences in the indictment. In other words you cannot reason or say, 'look we are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about one or all of the specific charges brought by the Crown because we do not think the evidence proves them but we think he committed one of these uncharged other acts so we will convict him of one of the specific offences in substitution, even though we are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence actually establishes that he committed the specifically charged offence.' You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong to the complainant on another occasion, he must have done so on the occasions in the indictment.""

93Her Honour did, on more than one occasion, emphasise to the jury that they could only use this evidence if they believed that the complainant's account was ""true"".

94The essence of the applicant's complaint is that in the course of his closing address the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the applicant had, over a period of time, seduced the complainant. He submitted that ""the Crown case is that the sexualised behaviour was in effect a kind of progressive seduction - a grooming process if you will and you see the Crown case is and this is [the complainant's] evidence ..."" It was submitted that by putting the matter in this way the Crown Prosecutor invited the jury to engage in tendency reasoning.

95In the course of the summing up her Honour referred to the Crown Prosecutor's argument. However, she did so having explained to the jury that it was important to explain the relevance of the evidence of other acts and that it was: 

""admitted solely for the purpose of placing the complainant's evidence of the particular acts charged against the accused by the Crown, to put the charges in the indictment into what the Crown says is a realistic context. That context, the Crown argued to you, was one of increasing sexual conduct initiated by the accused towards the complainant from shortly after she came to live with them right until the time of the first specific counts in the indictment, count one in circumstances where he was persuading her that such behaviour was normal desensitising her to sexualised behaviour and, on the Crown argument, grooming her so that she would engage in that behaviour with him.""

96The applicant sought to utilise the remarks by Howie J in Toalepai v R [2009] NSWCCA 270 at [45] to support his submission. In that case Howie J discussed the decision of this Court in Rodden v R [2008] NSWCCA 164; (2008) 182 A Crim R 227.

97In Rodden the Crown in addressing the jury had referred to the evidence of other acts of misconduct arising from the complainant's allegations that it happened ""millions of times"" and told the jury that this was evidence that the accused had been ""conditioning"" the child from an age when she was unable to understand the nature of the misconduct. Howie J said:

""The Crown was referring to this evidence, not just to give context to the specific complaints of the child, but in terms that could be taken by the jury to indicate that it was a part of a course of conduct designed to make it easier for the appellant to commit the specific offences set out in the indictment because the child would be compliant and failed to complain. In effect this was tendency reasoning. This was a matter that the court took into account in determining whether the direction given to the jury was adequate.""

98Howie J went on to indicate that in a case where tendency is raised for the jury's consideration by reason of some evidence that is placed before it for the purpose of proving a propensity on the part of the accused, the failure to give a tendency warning in respect of other evidence not being used for a tendency purpose ""could amount to a serious defect in the summing up"". This was because once a jury had been alerted to the concept of tendency reasoning it should be directed when such reasoning was available and when it was not. His Honour said at [44]:

""The distinction should be drawn between evidence admitted to prove a propensity and evidence not admitted for that purpose. Juries should be directed in clear terms, that if they reject the tendency reasoning arising from specific evidence they could not use that reasoning in relation to other evidence that was admitted for that purpose."" 

99At issue in Toalepai and Rodden was the consequence of the fact that the trial judge had not given a warning against tendency reasoning. 

100In the present case, although the Crown did suggest that the evidence of other acts disclosed a process of grooming of the complainant, her Honour was careful to direct the jury that it must confine the relevance of that evidence to the issue of context. Her Honour gave a comprehensive warning to the jury that it must not use the evidence as establishing a tendency on the part of the applicant to commit the offences charged. I am satisfied that the directions which her Honour gave were adequate and appropriate. No complaint was made by trial counsel and I would refuse leave under Rule 4 to raise this ground of appeal. 

Ground 8: Her Honour erred in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of a protected confidence, contrary to the prohibition found in s 298 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

101During the trial evidence was given by Ms Versace, a social worker, which included the following conversation between herself and the complainant:

""Q: What was that she said was causing her fear and anxiety?
A: She told me she was afraid of her home situation, at that time she was living with her uncle, she said she'd been there since the age of 9 living with her aunt and uncle because her father had passed away and her mother was unwell and that her uncle had increasingly become more demanding and threatened to kill [the complainant] and her boyfriend if they didn't comply with his demands and his rules that he had put in place.""

102The applicant submitted that this evidence was of a protected confidence as defined by s 296(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and for that reason was inadmissible.

103Section 296(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that a protected confidence means ""a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence"". Subsection 4(a) in turn defines a ""counselling communication"" as being ""a communication ... made in confidence by a person (""counselled person"") to another person (""the counsellor"") who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered ..."".

104Subsection 5 provides that a person ""counsels"" another person if:

""a. The person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and
b. The person:

(i) listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or 
(ii) advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person,

whether or not for fee or reward.""

105Ms Versace was trained as a social worker and was employed in that role at Camden Hospital at the relevant time. Part of her duties included the assistance of persons who came to the hospital in times of crisis. She met the complainant in her professional capacity and in that role gave her advice. 

106Section 296(2)(b) of the Act provides that a counselling communication is a protected confidence even if it was not made in connection with a sexual assault offence. Although the counselling communication of Ms Versace to the complainant was not made in the context of the present charges it is nevertheless a protected confidence within the meaning of the section.

107Section 298(3) provides that evidence is not to be adduced in a criminal proceeding if it would disclose:

""a. a protected confidence, or

b. the contents of a document recording a protected confidence, 

unless the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.""

108It was submitted that in the present case although the issue was discussed the trial judge was not asked to and did not give leave for Ms Versace to give the relevant evidence. It was submitted that the error by her Honour was the failure to require the Crown Prosecutor to seek leave to ask the question. This purported error was similar to that identified in R v Brownlow [2003] SASC 262; (2003) 86 SASR 114 at [43]. Although s 300(1) of the Act provides that the complainant could have consented to the use of the material, it was submitted there was no relevant consent. Section 300(2) requires that the consent be in writing.

109This issue was not raised at the trial and accordingly leave pursuant to Rule 4 is required.

110To my mind the applicant's submission is entirely without merit. The issue was discussed between the trial judge and defence counsel during the first trial when the latter indicated that he was content for the evidence to go in ""provided your Honour is happy the preconditions are met"". 

111In the present trial the issue of evidence of privileged communications being given was again discussed. Although there is confusion in the transcript as to which witness is being referred to, it is apparent that the complainant had no objection to the privileged evidence being given. However, it is also clear that the terms of the legislation were not complied with. They should have been.

112Notwithstanding, the question for this Court is whether, in the absence of the statute being complied with there has been a miscarriage of justice.

113It is plain that defence counsel wanted the evidence of Ms Versace before the jury. In the course of his address to the jury he emphasised that although the complainant had consulted Ms Versace she had not complained about being sexually abused. This was obviously a matter of significance and, accordingly, the evidence of Ms Versace was evidence favouring the applicant. The privilege provided by the statute is a privilege that belonged to the complainant. I am satisfied that she had no objection to the evidence being given. I am further satisfied that the giving of the evidence in circumstances where the statute had not been complied with did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. Leave to argue this ground of appeal should be refused. 

Ground 9: In relation to count 13, her Honour erred in failing to assist the jury with the meaning of the expression ""under authority"" as employed by s 61J(2)(e) Crimes Act 1900.

Ground 10: In relation to count 13, her Honour improperly usurped the jury's function, by giving it what would have been understood as a binding direction of law, to find the aggravating circumstances of ""being under the authority"" of the applicant to have been proven beyond reasonable doubt, if accepted the evidence of the complainant.

114At the trial defence counsel applied for a directed verdict of not guilty in relation to counts 13 and 14. The application was based upon two grounds. One ground was that there was no evidence capable of proving that the complainant was ""under the authority"" of the applicant. The application was dismissed.

115One of the arguments which the trial judge rejected was that because the complainant was 18 years old by the time that counts 13 and 14 were alleged to have occurred she could not, as a matter of law, be under the authority of the applicant.

116In the course of her summing up the trial judge provided the jury with some written directions which her Honour discussed with them. In relation to this issue she said:

""So I am going to give you some directions now about what that means. First of all the definition which I have read out to you and that is a person is under the authority of another person if the person is in the care or under the supervision or authority of that other person. That is the legal definition of this concept relevant to this trial. You might immediately notice that it is a very wide definition."" 

117Later her Honour returned to counts 12, 13 and 14 and said this:

""Now for each of those charges as brought, the Crown must also prove beyond reasonable doubt, that is 12, 13 and 14, that the complainant was under the authority of the accused. I went through that with you in relation to the earlier counts for which that is relevant, that is one to ten inclusive and I gave you the definition that a person is under the authority of another person if the person is in the care or under the supervision or authority of the other person and I said to you that you might think there was not any dispute that up until the time the complainant turned sixteen the Crown would be in a position to prove that she was under the authority of the accused and for that matter the accused and his wife. That was because of the orders made in the Children's Court which lasted until she was sixteen. But you also know that for counts 12, 13 and 14, she was over sixteen and that Children's Court order no longer had any effect and particularly so for counts 13 and 14 you know that not only was there no Children's Court order in place but by that stage she was eighteen and legally an adult capable of voting and doing all those things that come with legal adulthood, or legal majority.

The Crown, on the evidence, must prove to you for the way those charges have been brought 12, 13 and 14, that for each of these offences even if all of these other things you are satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt, that she was under his authority, that is the circumstance of aggravation that they rely on. To do so the Crown relies on a variety of pieces of evidence. Part of it is the same sort of evidence relied on in relation to some of the consent issues namely that the nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant was one in which he had groomed her to go along with him, one in which he was dominant over her, and that you would accept that he was a domineering person, that you would accept on the evidence that he was a person who was fairly strict in his controls in the household. What is more the evidence relied on is that you would accept that she was still a member of that household, albeit for the last two as a legal adult, that for count 12 she was still a schoolgirl, reliant on the complainant and his wife and also it is put that you would accept the evidence of the complainant that even up until the time of the event that led to her leaving the household on 20 March 2004, she was asking for permission to go and see a soccer match and at that stage she was eighteen.

If you accept all of that evidence then you would be entitled to find that she was under the authority of the accused. On behalf of the accused of course you know the evidence is from him and from his wife. He denies that degree of control. You might think he was saying that he accepted that he was a fairly tough disciplinarian in the household. You might also think that he was saying to you that he thought he was doing what was best for her, trying to insist that she concentrate on her schoolwork and not go out with boys and the like. You know that he denied that she asked permission to go to the soccer match or that she should have felt it necessary to ask for that permission when she was eighteen.

You know he said that she had lots of friends, that she went out a lot, that some of those were boys during the earlier years, that you might think he was saying he did not much like [the complainant's boyfriend] and that there were others of her male friends who he did quite like in the past and you also know the evidence of course is that she did go to Schoolies for a week, although you also know evidence that he made a phone call during that which you may or may not think supports the Crown's contention of his control. In any event that is all of the evidence that you are entitled to take into account, to look at whether or not you accept beyond reasonable doubt that in fact she was under his authority and namely a person who is either in the care of or under the supervision or authority of the other person and the argument of course on behalf of the accused is not only would you not accept that some of this evidence was not correct or that some of what are said to be the glosses put on it are not correct, but that in fact in particular for the last two counts when she was eighteen you simply would not accept that as an adult it would be appropriate to find beyond reasonable doubt that she was under the authority of the accused. That would be a matter for you to decide.""

118The applicant submitted that in giving these directions the trial judge had failed to define the legal principles necessary for the determination of these counts: R v Dao [2005] VSCA 196; (2005) 156 A Crim R 459 at [21] (Buchanan, Vincent JJA and Byrne J). Although accepting that the trial judge's direction was ""plainly correct"" it was submitted that it was of no assistance to the jury. It was submitted that to state that a person is under the authority of another person if the person is under the authority of the other person is not helpful. Furthermore, it was submitted that the additional words ""care"" and ""supervision"" do not assist in determining the meaning of the expression ""under authority"".

119It was submitted that her Honour should have provided the jury with more assistance and could have provided them with a dictionary definition of the terms appearing in s 61H(2) Crimes Act 1900. This was the procedure approved by Brooking JA in R v Howes [2000] VSCA 159; (2000) 2 VR 141, 159 at [57] and is consistent with the approach taken by the trial judge in R v DH [2003] VSCA 220. 

120It was submitted the error was compounded by her Honour's recitation of the evidence. It was submitted that ""in practical terms her Honour's comments ... would have been understood by the jury to be a direction of law to the effect that they should find the element proven so long as the jury accepted the complainant's evidence"". It was submitted that there was a need for the judge to be careful that in expressing a view about evidence the jury were not overawed: Taleb v R [2006] NSWCCA 119 at [76] (Simpson J).

121It was submitted that without having been provided with a definition of the term ""under authority"" the jury was left with only one test to apply, namely whether it believed the complainant's account. It was submitted that it is plain that not every form of control constitutes ""authority"" for the purposes of s 61H(2). In Anderson v R [2010] VSCA 108 at [94] Weinberg J held that the applicant's control over the television remote and choice of movies did not mean that the complainant was under the authority of the applicant.

122The issue was not raised by trial counsel and Rule 4 applies.

123It is apparent that the issue of ""under the authority of"" was a vital issue at the trial. This is confirmed by the unsuccessful application for a directed verdict. 

124The applicant does not complain that her Honour erred in the directions she gave beyond a submission that the jury should have been given further assistance. Although in many cases a dictionary may prove useful, where the words of the section are clear there may be little to gain from resort to a dictionary. The words of a dictionary cannot be substituted for the words of the Act. In some circumstances reference to the words of a dictionary may constitute error. 

125I accept that by referring in terms to ""authority"" the definition in s 61H(2) is circular. However, the additional components of care or supervision make plain the nature of the relationship to which the section is directed. I see no reason why her Honour should have provided further assistance to the jury. Each of the words ""care"", ""supervision"" and ""authority"" are ordinary English words which the jury would have had no difficulty in understanding.

126Her Honour was careful to provide the jury with assistance as to the evidentiary matters relevant to this issue. No complaint is made about the accuracy of her Honour's reference to the factual material. It is plain that if the jury accepted that evidence there could be only one conclusion in relation to this issue. 

127I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal.

Ground 11: the sentence imposed on the applicant by Goldring DCJ in respect of the assault on 20 March 2004 was manifestly excessive.

128The applicant was tried and convicted for offences relating to other complainants before Goldring DCJ and a jury. At that time he also pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault of the present complainant. That incident, as discussed in relation to Grounds 4 and 5, occurred on 20 March 2004.

129Goldring DCJ sentenced the applicant for those other charges, imposing a sentence of 5 years imprisonment commencing 16 June 2008 with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring 15 June 2011. His Honour imposed a sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 9 months for the assault of the present complainant. That sentence was ordered to commence on 16 January 2011 with the non-parole period to expire on 15 October 2011 and the total term to expire on 15 July 2012. The maximum penalty for the offence was 2 years imprisonment. The resulting sentence was concurrent with the sentence for the other charges for a period of 5 months.

130The applicant successfully appealed his conviction in relation to the other charges. He also appealed the sentence for the assault of the present complainant. This Court determined that it would not grant leave to appeal that sentence. The majority said it should be reconsidered with the sentence for the present counts. As it happens, that sentence is wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed for those other counts.

131The facts concerning the assault on which the applicant was sentenced was the subject of findings by Goldring DCJ. In summary it entailed throwing a bowl at the complainant, grabbing her throat and pushing her against a door whilst yelling at her. The sentencing judge concluded that it was ""a violent and serious assault"" and an ""extremely serious type of domestic violence"" committed by a person in the ""position of the father"" of the victim. His Honour found that the applicant's reaction was ""violent and frenzied"".

132The plea was entered at a late stage and for that reason the sentencing judge found that only a ""relatively small discount should be applied"". His Honour noted that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court and accordingly the principles discussed by Hall J in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 were relevant.

133There was also evidence of a mental disorder that the sentencing judge took into consideration to ameliorate the sentence. 

134The sentencing exercise required of Golding DCJ was complex. His Honour was sentencing for sexual assaults of persons other than the present complainant but sentencing for common assault of the present complainant. As a consequence his Honour no doubt approached that sentencing exercise confined by the facts relating to the assault without a knowledge or appreciation of all of the offences involving the complainant with which the applicant was to be charged and ultimately convicted. Viewed in isolation the findings made by Golding DCJ were clearly open. However, as Schmidt J said when the application for leave to appeal was first considered ""the assault was arguably one incident in a lengthy history of abuse of the victim ... . Such a conclusion would have a significant impact on whether one should conclude that the sentence for the assault was manifestly excessive"".

135The applicant does not challenge the sentences that were imposed on him by Tupman DCJ. This resulted in an overall sentence of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years.

136Although the common assault was serious and committed by the applicant in the context of a history of serious sexual abuse over many years, I am satisfied that the sentence which Goldring DCJ imposed was manifestly excessive. Although a bowl was thrown at the complainant and she was grabbed at the throat she did not suffer physical injuries. The bowl was thrown at the feet of the complainant and, although she suffered distress, her evidence to the sentencing judge indicated that she accepted that he reacted as he did when trying to gain her attention.

137The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was suffering from ""quite severe mental problems"". He had been identified as suffering from ""chronic adjustment disorder, with depressed and anxious mood"" and had features common to persons suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The applicant had previously been referred by the police service, with whom he was employed, for anxiety/depression management and had been diagnosed by a psychologist suffering from a mental disorder. He was sentenced at a time when he had no prior convictions although his Honour recognised that his conduct was part of a sequence of serious offending in relation to the complainant. In these circumstances it is plain, as the sentencing judge accepted, that although his condition did not absolve him from responsibility it lessened the degree to which general deterrence was relevant to the sentence to be imposed.

138To my mind the appropriate sentence for the assault offence was a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment commencing on 16 January 2011. The sentence is wholly concurrent with the sentences that were otherwise imposed in relation to the applicant. In the circumstances I am satisfied that this is appropriate.

139In my judgment the following orders should be made:

(1)Leave to appeal convictions in relation to Grounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is refused.

(2)Appeal against conviction in relation to Ground 1 is dismissed. 

(3)Grant leave to appeal the sentence imposed with respect to the count of common assault being 2007/00016340-016 and the sentence imposed for that offence quashed. For that offence the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment commencing on 16 June 2012

2759912,FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: The applicant, FP, was found guilty by a jury on 15 December 2010 of three counts of administering an intoxicating substance with the intention of enabling another person to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual assault (s 38(a) Crimes Act 1900); three counts of sexual assault in company (s 61J Crimes Act); and one count of conspiracy to commit a sexual assault (common law).

3The maximum penalties prescribed by s 38 and s 61J are imprisonment for 25 years and 20 years respectively. The maximum penalty for the conspiracy offence is at large. A standard non-parole period is prescribed in respect of an offence against s 61J of 10 years.

4On 6 May 2011 her Honour Judge Hock imposed an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The sentence was specified to commence on 29 April 2011.

5Ultimately the applicant raised 15 grounds of appeal against conviction and 3 grounds of appeal against sentence. My reference to FP as the applicant is because each of the grounds requires leave to appeal.

Overview

6At the beginning of her remarks on sentence the judge described the circumstances giving rise to the offences as ""extraordinary"". I respectfully agree with that description.

7The applicant was tried jointly with Tony Golossian and AP. They were each charged but acquitted by direction of the trial judge in respect of an offence of obtaining property by false pretences. The offences for which the applicant was convicted were alleged to have been committed with either or both of those men and concerned a single complainant, MP. They related to events that occurred between April and June 2008.

8The Crown also alleged that Golossian and AP committed similar offences against another complainant, MM, in 2001 through to 2005. There were 33 counts in the indictment concerned with the offences against MM (some in the alternative) and a further 8 counts concerned with the offences against MP (1 of which was in the alternative). The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all of the primary counts in respect of both men. Golossian was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years and AP was sentenced to a total of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.

9The appellant was married to AP. Her brother, GK, was married to MP. AP was indirectly related by marriage to MP (he was a brother-in-law to her brother-in-law).

10Tony Golossian was regarded by some people in the Greek community as a holy man and a man who could communicate with angels. He had a prayer room in the back of his house at Dulwich Hill. He purported to be able to assist people who had been the subject of black magic or curses by praying on them.

11Both MM and MP were of Greek heritage and had strong religious beliefs. They claimed to be in fear of black magic, described as ""the evil eye"". They claimed to have been sexually assaulted in circumstances where Golossian was praying over them because of their need to be rid of a curse (""mayia"") that they believed had befallen them which would result in their death, and/or the death of family members. 

12GK was also superstitious and believed that Golossian could help his wife by interceding with the supernatural. They had previously sought assistance from Golossian in 1999 in relation to their financial affairs which they believed were adversely affected by a curse.

13The applicant was a woman of similar ethnic background to the complainants. She was also in fear of ""the evil eye"", particularly following her marriage to AP in 1993 and her contact with Golossian, who her husband professed was ""a holy man"", able to help others by praying to angels to remove curses and to create ""white magic"" to ward off ""the evil eye"".

Evidence review

14It is necessary to review the evidence in some detail to put some of the grounds of appeal in context, particularly because the final ground involves a contention that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

The complainant and her husband were cursed

15It was the Crown case that the three accused were parties to an elaborate agreement to frighten MP and GK into believing that they had been cursed and the only remedy was for MP to participate in ""prayer sessions"" with Golossian.

16In late 2007, MP's father was very ill. He was in his late 80s, suffering from diabetes and dementia, and had broken a hip in a fall. MP was naturally concerned about him. In her sentencing remarks the trial judge said that as a result MP was ""emotionally vulnerable"".

17In late January 2008, GK found a black object under the front door mat at their home. He showed it to MP. They did not know what it was. MP described it as a black round object wrapped in something like a plastic bag. MP rang her mother who told her to throw it away and go and talk to a priest. GK threw the object in the bin and the next Sunday the pair went to church and spoke to their priest (T97 - 99). The priest confirmed that the item should be thrown away and that they should have faith (T139). This object was subsequently referred to in the evidence as a ""mayia"".

18GK also gave evidence that earlier on the day the object was found he had seen AP in the front yard. He thought that this was unusual and went out to speak with him. He said AP appeared shocked, claimed that he was in the area to quote on a job for a client, and asked to come in for a drink of water (T452). It was the Crown case that AP had been there for the purpose of leaving the object, a conclusion the jury might readily have come to.

19Around this time there was a family barbecue at the home of GK's mother in Enfield, where AP and the applicant lived. GK received a text message during the course of this gathering. It said that a person had overheard a conversation at the recent wedding of MP's brother to the effect that a curse had been put on ""us"". It also said, ""Did you see the state of her father, sucked in to the bitch"". MP was aghast. At the time the message was received the applicant was at the table but AP was not. He returned a few minutes later (T100-101). The Crown suggested that he had sent the message.

20There was a discussion about what to do. The applicant advised that help should be sought from Tony Golossian. That was done and arrangements were made to see Golossian. The next day, GK and MP went with AP to Golossian's home. They were taken through to his ""prayer room"". Golossian purported to pray to angels in a foreign language. He then informed those present that the angels had advised that there was a curse on MP and GK. In fact there was more than one curse and they needed to be broken. GK and MP believed him. Golossian said there was one at the front of GK and MP's house, the one that had already been found. He said that disposing of it had made it harder to break the curse but he would try (T102 - 104).

21Golossian advised that if the curse was not broken, MP would die of cancer, GK would die from a fatal accident, and their children would slowly die as well. MP said she was ""totally shattered"". Golossian said, ""This is just the beginning, look at your father."" Both MP and GK were crying. MP and AP were asked to leave the room so that Golossian could speak with GK alone. When they were called back into the room, Golossian told them that GK had done something wrong to someone when he was young and to ""get this away"" he had to pay this person $50,000. If this was not done, GK would have to leave his family and go away and become a monk. 

22Golossian also told them that there were other ""mayias"", or curses, which had to be retrieved. One was at Rookwood cemetery and he gave detailed directions as to where it could be found. The other was in the front yard of GK and MP's home. After that was done, the only way to get rid of the curse, which was more so on MP, was to do a prayer over her whilst she was naked. Golossian purported to be reluctant to do this, saying that he did not do such things anymore. He suggested that someone else could do it but it would cost $20,000 to $25,000. They became hysterical and begged him to perform the prayer, and he ultimately agreed that he would do it for $3,000. Golossian told them that the prayer session had to be away from their home, near to water, and MP would have to be completely naked. MP said that she was horrified and scared but at the same time felt comfortable because he was a priest (T105 - 107).

23GK's evidence included that when he was alone with Golossian in the prayer room, Golossian told him that the angels had said that he had sinned when he was very young. GK asked, ""What have I done?"" Golossian replied, ""The angels said when you were very young you could have any woman in the world but not this one."" If he did not want to have to leave his family and become a monk he would have to pay $50,000 to this woman. GK asked how he could explain this to MP and Golossian suggested he tell her that he had a gambling problem when he was young (T470 - 471). GK well knew what ""sin"" Golossian was talking about; he had sexually assaulted the applicant when she was about 6 or 7 years of age and he was 12 or 13 (T606 - 607). It was the Crown case that Golossian had derived this information not from ""angels"" but from the applicant.

24The three left Golossian's home and went back to the applicant's home at Enfield. MP remained there while GK went off with AP to retrieve the ""mayias"". While they were away, MP spoke with the applicant. She asked her, ""How could people do things like this?"" The applicant told her that there were evil people out there and that she had been dealing with this for the last 15 years since she became married. GK and AP eventually returned with the mayias that they had found which were subsequently delivered to Golossian's home (T107). 

25I interpolate that there was other evidence suggesting that these two mayias were retrieved on different occasions but the point is of no significance.

26GK gave evidence of going with AP to find the two ""mayias"" that Golossian had told them about. One was in the front yard of their home and the other at Rookwood cemetery. GK said that on both occasions it was AP who managed to find the item (T465; 474-476), suggestive, the Crown contended, of Golossian and AP being participants in an elaborate scheme.

27The following day, after a phone call from Golossian, MP and GK went to his home. In the prayer room they were shown the two mayias which had been opened. One of them contained what appeared to MP to be her hair and her underwear which she identified by the colour and the brand. The other mayia contained small bones with fine writing on them. MP said that she recalled an occasion when the applicant had been to her home and had performed some ironing. All of MP's clothes were nearby in a clothes basket (T396). MP told her to desist from doing her ironing and she recalled that the applicant had walked to her bag and ""it looked like she was putting something in the bag"". Golossian told them that he would pray over the mayias to break the curse. As for the $50,000, he said that it had to be paid within 3 months and before the prayer session with MP. In relation to the prayer session, he told them that MP had to have finished her periods and had to be completely clean shaven. She was to bring along clippings of her hair, with underarm and pubic hair in separate envelopes (T108 - 109).

28GK began to receive calls and messages on his phone. There was ""some sort of a demon-like voice"". The messages ""were of naked - or penises and so forth"". GK and MP had been told by Golossian and AP that they were to write anything unusual in a book, purportedly so that if anything evil came in, Golossian would pray over it and break the evil. The book was given to Golossian but copies were retained by GK and MP (Exhibit F). The notes included that there were calls from a private number on 24 March 2008 with someone whispering the words ""Satan"", ""evil"" and ""prayer"" and there was talk about death for GK and MP. There were subsequent calls and messages with sexual content, for example, ""I am King Satan the Evil, I send to you this pussy and put under your pillow when you sleep and I will be with you and your wife when you dream"" (T110 - 115). GK recalled that these calls and texts included the caller saying, ""I am Evil"" and ""I am gunna fuck your wife"" (T479).

The first prayer session (Counts 35 and 36)

29GK contacted Golossian at a time when MP had finished menstruating. Golossian said he would speak to the angels who would decide when would be a good time for the prayer session. He subsequently gave GK instructions which he was to pass on to the applicant about booking a hotel room, buying orange juice, apple juice and some candles (T485).

30The first prayer session took place on 5 April 2008. The applicant picked up MP. She told the applicant that she was afraid and nervous but the applicant reassured her that she should not be afraid; she should not fight it; ""it is going to be like a dream, hundred per cent real, but it is not"". She said that this was said to her ""constantly"". Golossian was picked up and they proceeded to the Marco Polo hotel at Summer Hill. Golossian told the applicant to go out and buy some food and some apple and orange juice, which she did. While she was gone, Golossian spoke with MP about what was to occur. He told her to be strong and not afraid and that it will feel like an angel will be entering her body; if she felt dizzy or unwell, that was a good thing. He also told her that ""it's going to feel like it's 100 per cent real but it's not, it's just a dream"" (T110; 119 - 120).

31The applicant returned with the food and juice. The food was eaten and then Golossian prayed over the juice. Candles were lit. Golossian told the applicant that if she felt any pain during the prayer session she should go into the bathroom and say the Lord's Prayer 15 times, and continue to do so until the pain left her. He then put MP's hair clippings on a silver tray that she had also been asked to bring and burnt them. He gave MP the apple juice and she started to drink it but then put it down. He told her it did not matter if she did not drink all of that juice, but then gave her the orange juice and told her it was very important that she drink it all. MP drank all the orange juice and then felt light headed. She was then told to go into the bathroom and undress and put a towel around herself. MP said that by this time she was feeling dizzy. She stumbled when she went to the bathroom but undressed and returned with the towel around her. She was told to sit on the edge of the bed and to close her eyes. Golossian put a hand on her head and was praying. She said by now she was feeling very dizzy and very heavy (T120 - 122).

32MP was guided to lie face-up on the bed. She was told to keep her eyes closed and to remove the towel. She said she then felt pricks, like pin needles, over her joints. She also felt some substance being rubbed on her. She felt movement of Golossian's hands and she could hear voices, one saying that it was evil and another saying it was an angel. They asked her who she would want to have sex with, either her neighbour, CP (another brother-in-law) or AP. She replied, ""Neither, I want my husband [GK]."" The evil voice became angry and demanded that she choose one of the three men and she said, ""[AP]"". MP said that the voices sounded the same; they had the same accent but just different pitches (T123 - 124).

33At one point she opened her eyes and Golossian threatened to stop the prayer. He put a towel over her head and told her not to look. She felt a hand move towards her thighs, towards her vagina. Fingers then penetrated her vagina. This continued for a few minutes and she then felt Golossian on top of her and his penis penetrating her. She was crying and said, ""Can you stop it hurts""; however he continued. He told her to pray to the angels that she not fall pregnant - that was said in an evil voice. He ejaculated in her vagina. She asked if it was over and whether she could lift the towel but he told her to leave it on. He said that in his normal voice. A few minutes later the towel was taken off her and she was asked to put it around her and to go and have a shower. The applicant assisted her into the bathroom where she had a shower. She said there was a discharge, clarified in her later complaint to her friend, HD, as a discharge from her vagina (T124 - 126; 1790).

34The applicant then escorted MP out of the bathroom. She asked Golossian how it went, and he said that he believed that it went okay and that he would pray and let her know. MP said that she felt ""really dizzy, heavy and just tired"". The applicant then drove MP home, and dropped Golossian near his home along the way. MP said that she slept most of the way and when she arrived home she went straight to bed (T126). In her complaint to HD she said that she told the applicant that she believed that she was raped, but the applicant told her that there was no chance of that happening because the applicant had been in the room the whole time, aside from when she went to the bathroom to say the Lord's Prayer (T1790).

35The next morning MP told GK what had happened. She said that she was reluctant and afraid but did not know who else to turn to. She recalled that what she said included, ""If I am not pregnant by the end of the month I will be surprised"". GK became very angry and rang the applicant. He subsequently told MP that the applicant had reassured him that she was in the room for the whole time and ""that it was going to be the way it was, it felt like it was going to be a hundred percent real but it was just a dream"". GK received a text message. MP read it and said that it was ""something about the fact that they had taken me, something about having sex with me and I am them now and I am part of the evil"". They were both frantic. GK rang Golossian who asked them to come to his house. When they got there, he told them that the evil was still there and that there would have to be another prayer session (T126 - 128).

Payment of $50,000 to the applicant

36MP arranged a bank loan of $50,000 and when it was approved she transferred the money to GK's account. He then met with the applicant on 8 and 10 April 2008 when on each occasion he gave her $25,000 in cash. GK informed Golossian of each payment, but not who he was giving the money to. He told the applicant that he had won some money and wanted to help her out. He said that she was shocked and told him he did not have to but he insisted. He subsequently asked Golossian to speak with the angels and find out if he had given the money to the right person. Golossian agreed to do so. He subsequently told GK that everything was fine and that he had given the money to the right person (T499 - 502). In cross-examination GK agreed that the applicant had told him that she did not want the money but he had insisted that she take it (T733 - 736). 

The second prayer session (Counts 37 and 38)

37The instructions MP received in relation to the second prayer session were the same as for the first; she had to be clean and not be menstruating. She was also told to bring candles, some cotton balls and some material for a blindfold. Golossian had told GK that MP must not open her eyes like she did at the first prayer session or else the evil would burn her eyes (T504). MP was also told to bring what she called her ""work bag"" (later clarified as being a handbag (T286)) so that it could be blessed or prayed upon. On this occasion she was picked up by the applicant at about 9.00am on a weekday, she thought probably a Tuesday. The conversation in the car was along the same lines as before; she was told not to be afraid, to be brave, and that it would feel real but it would be a dream. After Golossian was picked up they proceeded to a different venue, the Ashfield Motor Inn. The applicant collected the keys from the reception and they went to the room (T140 - 142).

38Golossian instructed the applicant to go and get food and drink. Golossian and MP spoke while the applicant was gone and MP said that he had reassured her. The applicant returned after about 20 or 30 minutes with orange juice and takeaway food. MP was not hungry but she was told to drink the orange juice after Golossian had prayed on it. She said the lid was off the container and that he was making hand movements over it, swilling it and blowing over it. MP struggled to drink all the juice and when she was half way through it, Golossian came over and took the bottle, swilled it around and then told her to drink it all. The applicant was in the room when this was happening (T143 - 144).

39MP said that she felt quite dizzy and heavy but not as bad as the first time. She went to the bathroom, undressed and came out with a towel around her. Golossian put the cotton balls, or pads, over her eyes, tied the material she had brought so as to blindfold her and then started to pray. MP said that she was aware of the applicant being in the room up until she was blindfolded. She was guided to lay down on the bed, similar to the first occasion. She felt fingers entering her vagina. She tried to ask who it was - ""Is that you Tony?"" She asked if the applicant was there, or if anyone was there, but there was no response. The fingers were then removed and she was told to move onto her side. She then felt a penis in her mouth. She felt sick and it was removed. He then told her, using the evil voice, to take his penis in her mouth. The penis was again forced into her mouth but she started gagging and it was removed. She was told by the evil voice to stay where she was on the bed. Next, Golossian told her to get up and that the applicant would help her go to the shower and clean herself (T144 - 146).

40The applicant helped MP to take a shower with the blindfold still on. She then got dressed and the applicant escorted her back to the room. She said that she felt very heavy and dizzy and needed help to walk. Golossian then removed the blindfold. Once again, MP asked him how it went and he replied that he thought it went okay but would pray and ask the angels. MP was then taken home by the applicant (T148).

41MP said that she was concerned as to why she was required to take her bag to this prayer session. She checked its contents and found that a picture of GK, some of her business cards and a deposit slip from her cheque book were missing. She told GK about this and he rang Golossian who informed him that it was the evil in the room that did this (T149 - 150).

42GK gave evidence that when MP arrived home she complained of being in pain, was tired and dizzy and ""she felt again that she was ... sexually assaulted or raped, she was penetrated, she felt someone on top of her and I think for the second prayer session she said she felt holding a penis"". He told her that it was probably a dream because that is what Golossian and the applicant had told him after the first prayer session (T505).

Other events

43MP said that she had a mobile phone and that she had been provided with another one by her employer. She recalled receiving a text message which said something about doing sexual acts with AP. She deleted it, as she did other messages that ""petrified"" her. One evening when GK was not home she received a message saying the evil will enter her home and she was to be ready for him. She was ""horrified and petrified"". She damaged the SIM card for her personal phone so that she could not receive any more messages. 

44On another occasion, GK was told by the angel that MP must be available to take a call at a nominated time. The call came in on GK's phone and MP took it. It was the evil, not the angel. She explained that in these calls, the caller announced whether it was either the evil or the angel and there was a difference in the tone of voice. In this particular call there was a reference to MP not having done ""the test"". There had been sexual references and mention of a ""test"" in previous messages she had received. In this particular call, after having been asked why she had not done ""the test"", the voice then spoke of harm to the family, to MP, her children and her father. Arrangements were made for a third prayer session because, as MP said she was told, she had broken the promise and had not done ""the test"" (T151 - 153).

Third prayer session (Counts 39 and 41)

45The third prayer session was on 1 May 2008, again at the Ashfield Motor Inn. MP was required to prepare herself and bring the same materials as before. The applicant picked her up and there was a similar conversation on the way in the car. The applicant told her that she should not be afraid, be strong and she also said that she (the applicant) had been through this before. MP said that she felt comforted by that. After Golossian was picked up they proceeded to the hotel, stopping along the way at a service station where the applicant purchased orange juice (T155 - 156).

46Similar events as before occurred once they were in the hotel room. The applicant was sent out by Golossian to buy food. When she returned, Golossian prayed over the orange juice and told MP to drink it all. She said that she then felt dizzy. She was then sent to the bathroom to disrobe and returned. She was blindfolded by Golossian whilst the applicant was still in the room. On this occasion she was told that she would hear noises, a door opening and closing and footsteps. She was told not to worry and that this was a normal thing to happen (T157 - 158).

47MP was guided to lie down on the bed. She was asked whether she was feeling dizzy or lightheaded and she replied that it was not as bad as previously. The towel was removed. She felt hand movements and the pricking of a needle through her joints. She then felt a body on top of her. She was told by the evil voice to rub her hands up against the hands of the person who was on top of her. She felt the penis of this man penetrating her. She was crying and sobbing. The evil voice told her to grab the arms of the person and act as if she was enjoying it. She described features of the person as different to what she had felt on the previous occasions (that is, it was not Golossian). The man removed his penis and she heard him masturbating until he ejaculated on her hand. She heard the sound of a phone ticking, ""like a text"". Golossian then said in his normal voice, ""wait, I'll wipe this off you"" and she felt her hand being wiped (T158 - 163).

48MP was told to get up, put the towel around herself and go to the bathroom. She said that the applicant was in the room, and the applicant was also sobbing and asking whether her eldest daughter was alright. Golossian told her that she was. The applicant then helped MP into the shower before they returned to the room and there was similar conversation as before about how it went. The applicant rang AP. It was arranged that the applicant would drop MP at the Westfield shopping centre at Burwood where GK would pick her up, whilst AP would come and take Golossian home. As the applicant drove MP away from the hotel, within two to five minutes she saw AP driving in the opposite direction towards the hotel (T164 - 165). It was the Crown case that he was so near to the motel because he had just been there, sexually assaulting MP.

49GK picked MP up at the shopping centre and took her home. They had the usual conversation about how it went and she told him that Golossian would speak to the angels to find out. She also told him that someone had ejaculated in her hand. GK became upset because MP was not supposed to talk about what happened in the prayer sessions; he was afraid the evil would come back harder (T166). GK's evidence was that she said, ""I've been raped again, felt someone on top of me"" but once again GK thought that it was a dream (T515).

Events following the third prayer session

50GK was instructed to go and buy MP another mobile phone because she had destroyed her own phone, or at least its SIM card, so as to avoid the disturbing communications she had been receiving. The new phone was given to Golossian to bless before she started to use it (T170).

51A fourth prayer session was proposed; MP thought this might have been for 5 June 2008. She was told that she would first have to do ""the test"" and it had to be something sexual with AP. She had been told this in an earlier text message as well. After she received the new phone she started to receive calls and texts. She was scared about the prospect of ""the test"". She said that she could not talk to GK about it because he was so deep into the belief that he would not listen; he was scared for their safety. MP said that she still had a little bit of belief that all of this was true but she wondered how it was going to stop. She could not tell anyone. She decided to buy a tape recorder to record all the messages in the hope that this would give her the courage to tell someone (T167 - 170).

52At this point in her evidence, MP said that it had been necessary to beg Golossian to perform each prayer session and this was always in the presence of the applicant and AP. Further, Golossian said that he would not do them on his own without the applicant being present. MP said that she and GK thus had to ask the applicant to come along. On the occasion of one of these conversations, the applicant told them that she had a dream that MP's father had died and that it was all MP's fault because ""I didn't do this prayer, this fourth prayer, and that I should get out of the church, you know, he stood up from the coffin and said 'get out, get out, it's all her fault' and Tony's response was that it was because I didn't do, if I am not going to do the prayer that is what will happen"" (T172 - 173). In cross-examination she said that the applicant had said that in the dream her father blamed MP for him being dead because she did not do the test, and that Golossian added that it was a message from the angels saying that she must do the test (T435-6).

53MP said that she purchased the tape recorder and recorded some calls on her phone (T173). These recordings were before the jury (Exhibit B) and strongly supported her account in a broad sense, in particular as to the following events.

54MP said that she built up the courage to talk to someone just before the fourth prayer session was due to be held. She spoke briefly with her friend, HD, at a family gathering and arranged to meet her the following day, when she told her at some length about what had been happening and played the tape recordings to her. This complaint was largely, although not completely, consistent with the evidence MP gave (T1785 - 1794). Any inconsistencies were readily capable of being regarded by the jury as minor, particularly having regard to the fact that the conversation occurred on 2 June 2008 and HD did not make her statement until 27 August 2008. One example is that there is mention of insistence that MP drink all of the apple juice as opposed to the orange juice; another is that whilst there was mention of digital penetration in the second prayer session there was no mention of a penis penetrating her mouth.

55After her meeting with HD, MP went to Wetherill Park police station and spoke with a police officer. She was uncomfortable with the outcome and returned the following day. After spending quite some time speaking with a detective, she returned home where her husband told her that he had been trying to call her. She did not tell him where she had been, apparently on the instructions of the detective. GK told her that the evil or the angel had been calling him because they could not contact her. At his suggestion she called Golossian but the evil answered and said, ""Why did you lie to us, you didn't do the test?"" She made an excuse and he recommended that she ring AP to arrange a time for the test. She said she had mixed feelings and was scared about doing this but had been reassured that the police were going to help her. There followed a number of communications with AP concerned with setting a time and date for ""the test"". Ultimately she had to put it back a day in order to allow time for the police to arrange a listening device (T175 - 182).

56The ""test"" was to occur on 4 June 2008 at AP's home. MP drove there but then parked and waited in the car as ""the evil"" had instructed her. She received a telephone call and a recording of the conversation was before the jury. The caller said that he was the ""red evil"" and told her she was ""now in the dream test"". He related a series of instructions as to what she was to do when she was inside the house with AP. In short, she was told to say certain things that would put him into a trance and she was then to engage in sexual intercourse with him. She was threatened that she must do exactly as she was told ""or we will take your father and your daughter"". At the conclusion of the call she was instructed by police to knock on the door and that when AP appeared, officers would intervene to arrest him. That is what transpired (Exhibit C).

57At 1.40pm on 4 June 2008, the applicant sent a text to her husband telling him that he had better be on standby for the children, presumably a reference to picking them up from school. The applicant's evidence was that she was in the city that day at a market research exercise. However, at 3.35pm she sent another text to him saying, ""I'm feeding the kids, don't know what time coming until I get call"" (T1959).

58I do not intend to deal with the evidence of Tony Golossian or AP in any detail but it is appropriate to mention at this point that the latter admitted that he made the calls to MP, including the one recorded by the police, but said that he was ""messing with her mind"" (T2534). He also admitted having made previous calls and texts, and his explanation was to the effect that he was acting at the behest of GK who wanted to scare MP into becoming a more submissive wife.

59In cross-examination, GK said that it was he who gave instructions to the applicant as to what she was to do in relation to the prayer sessions, including that she was to purchase the juice and that if she did not feel well she was to go to the bathroom, face the mirror and say the Lord's Prayer. GK said that he was relaying these instructions from calls and text messages he received from the angels. He would ring Golossian and let him know and Golossian would say, ""You know if the angels said that, you do that"" (T721 - 727; 752)

Administration of a drug

60There was no direct evidence that a drug was administered to MP at any of the prayer sessions. On each occasion, juice was purchased by the applicant and given to Golossian. The applicant maintained that the bottles were not opened before she gave them to him. The Crown queried this but was in no position to positively assert which of the two put the drug in the juice.

61The fact that a drug was put in the juice was sought to be proved by the following circumstantial evidence. The general practitioner who had treated MP for some 10 years said that he had never prescribed Stilnox or Zolpidem for her, or any member of her family. MP said she had not taken any sleeping medication in 2008. Hair samples taken from her on 17 July 2008 were analysed at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine by an expert in forensic toxicology, Voula Staikos, who gave evidence that Zolpidem was detected. With an assumption made that hair grows at the rate of one centimetre per month, it was determined that there was a significant amount found in hair that had grown in the period of about 17 March to 17 May and trace amounts in hair that had grown approximately 2 months before and 2 months after that period. The peak readings were, of course, in the period when the three prayer sessions had occurred.

62There was evidence that a forensic chemist had advised the police that Stilnox could be dissolved quickly in orange juice without any change in its appearance. Dr William Allender from the Clinical Forensic Medical Unit, who had expertise in the effects of drugs and poisons, gave unchallenged evidence that Zolpidem is eliminated from the body in an average of about 2.5 hours but is remains detectable in the hair. He said that a person who has taken Zolpidem would have a compromised ability to repel any unwanted attention and memory is decreased in respect of events which occur whilst under its effect. MP said that after drinking the juice she felt dizzy and lightheaded. Her memory of events in the subsequent hours was compromised. Although she perceived she was being sexually assaulted, her capacity to repel the attacker was impaired.

Telephone evidence

63There was a considerable amount of evidence in the trial about the various phones that were used by the accused, and by GK and MP. It is unnecessary to review this body of evidence as it primarily served, on the Crown case, to inculpate Golossian and AP rather than the applicant by identifying the possible origin of the calls and messages that GK and MP received.

The defence cases

64It is also unnecessary to review the evidence given by each accused in the trial. Where necessary, I refer in more detail to aspects of the applicant's evidence below in the context of ground 15. A brief overview of the respective cases will suffice for present purposes.

65Golossian denied that he had administered any intoxicating substance or had sexual intercourse with the complainant. AP also denied having sexual intercourse at the third ""prayer session"". 

66The applicant denied that she was part of an agreement to administer anything to MP and said that during each of the ""prayer sessions"" she was present in the room, but had gone to the bathroom to say the Lord's Prayer a number of times when Golossian was praying over the complainant. She never saw or heard anything to suggest that a sexual assault had occurred. Otherwise, she claimed that she did what she was told by Golossian and GK. She denied knowledge of any plan for MP to be sexually assaulted in any of the ""prayer sessions"" or in ""the test"". Evidence was called as to the applicant's good character.

The hotel/motel rooms

67It is appropriate to say something about the nature of the accommodation at the Marco Polo hotel and the Ashfield Motor Inn. It is relevant to the submissions to which I will refer later concerning the ""in company"" element and the possibility that the applicant may have been in the bathroom at the time sexual assaults occurred. Photographs of rooms at each place were before the jury (Exhibits M and N). It is clear that the rooms were modest in both size and furnishings in relatively inexpensive establishments. They were hardly suites in a five star hotel.

The requirement for leave to appeal

68There were 13 grounds of appeal initially notified in respect of conviction but after leave was granted during the course of the hearing they were expanded to 15 and re-numbered. They each require leave, in the most part because they raise points not taken at trial: Criminal Appeal Rules, rule 4. Where that rule does not apply, the requirement for leave arises under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 because questions of fact are involved.

Rule 4

69Before turning to the grounds of appeal it is appropriate to say something about rule 4. There are a great many cases in this Court in which authoritative statements as to the purpose and effect of the rule may be found. There has been constant criticism of points being raised on appeal, often unmeritorious, which were not raised at trial. A useful recent summary was provided by the Chief Justice in ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266:

[146] Because the Crown submitted that r 4 applied in relation to these grounds and the subsequent grounds in which it was submitted there was no evidence fit to go to the jury or that there was latent duplicity, it is convenient at this stage to deal with the scope of r 4. Rule 4 provides as follows: 

""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal."" 

[147] The effect of the rule was summarised by McHugh J in Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 as follows (at [72]): 

""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted ... "" 

[148] Subsequent cases have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4: 

The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170]. 

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21]. 

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61]. 

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130]. 

70In the present case the applicant was represented at trial by counsel who appeared in this Court as junior to Mr Ramage QC. Somewhat surprisingly, the written submissions on behalf of the applicant made no mention of r 4 at all; it was only acknowledged by Mr Ramage at the outset of the hearing after it had been seen that the obvious point was being taken in the written submissions filed for the respondent. 

71Another surprising point is that, notwithstanding junior counsel on the application was counsel for the applicant at trial, no attempt was made to explain why the many points now sought to be argued were not raised by him before the trial judge. He is certainly not an inexperienced barrister and his conduct of the case at trial does not suggest that incompetence can be an explanation.

72As will be seen, the proposed grounds of appeal contain many contentions as to the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor and as to the legal correctness of the summing up by the trial judge. This may well be an indication that counsel ""saw no injustice or error in what was done"": Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [12], referring to R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191. A failure to take objections or request redirections to matters in the summing up is ""usually a reasonably reliable indicator of its fairness and adequacy"": Tekely v R; Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89], drawing from R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at 354. I would add that the lack of objection to cross-examination of an accused by the Crown Prosecutor, or to the content of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address, would also tend to suggest that there was not the unfairness which is now contended in this Court.

73The critical issue for the applicant to establish, as she bears the onus of showing that leave should be granted, is that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R; R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [21]. Another formulation of the test is that ""leave will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"": R v Tripodina, supra, at 195.

Ground 1: The trial miscarried and the Appellant did not receive a fair trial as a result of errors in the conduct of the trial and directions given to the jury as more particularly set out in the individual grounds hereunder.

74This ground adds nothing to the applicant's case and nothing more needs to be said about it.

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury as to the evidence relevant only against the Appellant

75In relation to this ground it is appropriate to reiterate that the applicant was only charged with offences alleged to have been committed against MP, whereas her co-accused were charged as well with offences alleged to have been committed against MM. The latter offences were said to have occurred between 2001 and 2005 while the offences against MP were alleged to have taken place in the first half of 2008. The Crown led evidence of other sexual activity involving MM as context evidence. It also relied upon coincidence evidence, that is, that the offences committed against each complainant bore certain remarkable similarities. In relation to the individual complainants, the Crown also asserted that the evidence established that Golossian and AP had a tendency to have a sexual interest in them and that they acted upon it by having sexual intercourse with them. When speaking of the coincidence evidence, the trial judge directed the jury that ""the evidence relating to the charges or counts in respect of one complainant may be relevant in relation to the other complainant. This is different from tendency where, as I say, you are restricted to the counts involving just the one complainant"" (SU 137.3).

76In support of this ground, it was submitted that the trial judge failed to distinguish between the evidence admissible in the case concerning the applicant and the evidence that was only relevant to, and admissible against, the co-accused. It was acknowledged that the judge directed the jury that there were three separate trials and that it was necessary for separate consideration to be given to the case concerning each accused. She explained that the reason for this was that there was some evidence available to be considered in the case of one accused that was not available in relation to another accused. She cited the example of the appellant's police interview being only evidence in her case. Similarly, the police interview of Golossian was only evidence in the case concerning him. Another example cited was an exhibit that related to offences concerning the complainant MM, the appellant not facing any charges concerning her (SU 8-9). After citing these items of evidence as examples, her Honour then said:

Generally most of the evidence is available for you to consider in the case of whichever accused you are considering at the time (SU 9.5).

77A little later in her summing up (SU 14-15) her Honour gave directions to the jury to separately consider of each of the multiple counts that each accused faced. These directions were in a conventional form. They included:

You must look at the evidence that relates to each of the specific charges and also what evidence, if any, you find in support and then make separate and distinct decisions about whether the accused whose case you are then considering is guilty or not guilty of that count. 

78A number of issues were raised by counsel for the co-accused at the next break in the summing up (SU 25 - 28), and subsequently, but there was no complaint in respect of these directions.

79Nine examples were cited in the applicant's written submissions which were said to constitute a failure of the judge to ""distinguish or sufficiently distinguish"" the evidence admissible against her with that which was only admissible against the co-accused, despite what her Honour had said earlier, as noted above (at [76]-[77]).

80It emerged in oral submissions that the primary concern was that, in considering the applicant's case, the jury may have taken into account evidence concerning the counts relating to MM. It was accepted that there had been no application by the applicant for a separate trial relating to this concern. Further, and as counsel for the respondent pointed out (1.2.12 at T1.38), it is somewhat ironic that the submission was made in this Court whereas in the court below, counsel for the applicant sought in his closing address to rely upon the case concerning MM in an endeavour to take forensic advantage of certain similarities and dissimilarities. For example, he submitted:

It is necessary for you, members of the jury, to put the case that's alleged against [FP] in the context of what happened prior to 2008, and that of course very much turns on what events occurred between 2001 and 2005, involving her husband [AP] and Tony Golossian in relation to [MM], and to perhaps a lesser extent, [MM's partner at the time]. (T3138.30)

81It was submitted that the need for the judge to carefully direct the jury as to the evidence that was available for consideration in the case concerning the applicant was heightened by the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor had addressed the jury (bearing in mind the irony I have just mentioned). It was contended that ""the Crown wound the cases together"" (31.1.12 at T2.4). Counsel for the applicant subsequently provided a list of transcript references for the Crown's closing address which were said to support a submission that the prosecutor had ""intermingled the inadmissible evidence regarding [MM] with admissible evidence involving [MP]"". Counsel for the respondent, with leave, provided further written submissions concerning these references.

82I have carefully reviewed each of the references upon which the applicant relies. I am unable to accept that they support the applicant's submission. It is unnecessary to deal with this in detail as the submission is by way of background to the ground under consideration.

83The Crown Prosecutor's closing address was structured so as to deal with the case concerning the offences against MM first. This occupies about 50 pages of transcript (T3049 - 3102). She then turned to deal with the offences concerning MP (T3102 - 3135). She then concluded with some very brief arguments addressing the similarities in the evidence of the two complainants and countering any suggestion that there had been joint concoction between them (T3135 - 3136).

84As the prosecutor reviewed the evidence of one complainant, or the other, she occasionally reminded the jury of the similarities between their accounts, or the accounts of the complainants' partners. This was a legitimate thing to do because the Crown case concerning Golossian and AP relied upon coincidence evidence. Counsel for the respondent correctly pointed out in her further written submissions that the Crown Prosecutor had at no stage made any suggestion that the similarities in the evidence concerning each complainant had anything to do with the applicant. The arguments put to the jury were confined to the other accused. For example, in the course of reviewing the evidence of MP, the prosecutor submitted:

Tony [Golossian] said ""It's going to feel a hundred per cent real but it's not, it's just a dream"". And you will compare that, I suggest, to what [MM] was told by Tony Golossian for her prayer session. Very similar thing, and that is no mere coincidence, members of the jury. (T3112.35)

85It was MP's evidence that before the first prayer session commenced she was commanded to go to the bathroom and take off all of her clothing and come back into the room with just a towel around her (T121). Golossian disputed this and asserted that the decision to remove all of her clothing was the complainant's (T2116). The prosecutor submitted to the jury:

Do you really accept that [MP] would go in of her own volition, change from her clothing into a towel, not even leaving a bra or underpants on, nothing on for fear of some oil getting on her clothing and come out into the room and say ""Don't worry, I'm like your daughter"" or ""I'm like your son"". I submit you wouldn't accept that she would have done that. She changed out of her clothing and into a towel because she had to, just like [MM]. (T3113.6)

86Another example relates to the account MP gave of a telephone call that she received from ""the red evil"" on 4 June 2008, just as she was about to attend the home of AP for ""the test"". The caller instructed her how to encourage him to have sex with her. She was told what to say and what to do in considerable detail. AP conceded that he had made the call but claimed that he was simply ""messing with her mind"" (T2534.22). The conversation was legally recorded by police. The instructions included:

... He will not agree [to have sex] and he will try to stop you ... No matter what he says, keep sucking ... The only way to make him agree is to say, 'if you do not fuck me, I will run outside and scream' ... suck him and pinch his nipple ... (Exhibit C. AB 337-338)

87In referring to this aspect of MP's account, the Crown Prosecutor reminded the jury of a similar aspect in MM's account. MM had received instructions to have sex with AP. They included:

He said that when I answered the door to [AP] I was to say to him, 'I want you to have sex with me'. He said to me that [AP] will say to me, 'No I don't want to.' He then said to me that I had to say to [AP] the exact words 'If you don't I will scream, the neighbours will hear me and I will cause trouble for you.' ... And he said that while I performed oral sex on [AP] I was to pinch his nipples as this is something that he liked. (T845.36 - 846.6)

88There was nothing wrong in each of these cases with the Crown Prosecutor pausing to remind the jury of similarities in the accounts given by the other complainant. As I have said, each of the passages to which the applicant referred related to evidence that concerned Golossian or AP. There was no invitation, or suggestion, that inadmissible evidence should be used in the jury's consideration of the case concerning the applicant.

89I turn to the passages in the trial judge's summing up that were said to support the proposition that she did not ""distinguish or sufficiently distinguish the evidence properly admissible against the [applicant] and that of her co-accused"". The first example was her Honour's statement in the context of directing the jury as to the elements of the conspiracy offence. She briefly reminded the jury of the evidence upon which the Crown relied in order to prove the existence of the relevant agreement. She concluded this by saying:

""And the Crown also relies on the phone records and text messages, SMS messages, between the accused, all three accused on 4 June and earlier"" (SU 64). 

90It was submitted that this invited the jury to consider all of the telephone call/text evidence, regardless whether it was relevant and admissible in relation to the alleged conspiracy.

91The vast majority of the telephone call/text evidence was not inculpatory of the applicant. The Crown did not suggest that she had on any occasion pretended to be ""the evil"" or ""the angel""; that was only asserted in respect of Golossian and AP. There were call charge records for various phones which showed contact between the applicant and her co-accused. Such contact between the persons alleged to be co-conspirators was relevant but, aside from text messages sent on the day the alleged conspiracy was to be played out, the content of any communications could not possibly have been regarded by the jury as indicating anything as to whether she was a party to it.

92The argument in this Court, but not the subject of complaint below, was that the above statement by the trial judge invited the jury to consider evidence that did not relate to the conspiracy, but related to the preceding ""prayer sessions"" and ancillary events concerning MP and also evidence that related to events concerning MM. Having reviewed the summing up as a whole I am not left with any doubt that the jury would have well understood that material concerning MM had nothing to do with the applicant. It was not explained how the jury could possibly have regarded telephone communications relating to the earlier prayer sessions as having any bearing upon the question of whether the applicant was a party to the conspiracy. Trial counsel obviously did not have any of the concerns now raised on behalf of the applicant.

93Other examples cited in the applicant's written submissions may be dealt with more briefly. Reference was made to her Honour's summing up concerning the counts alleging offences against MM. It was submitted that ""[a]t no stage did she direct the jury that none of that evidence ... was admissible on any basis against the [applicant]"" (AWS 1.1.4 (ii)). I fail to see how the jury could have regarded such evidence as bearing upon the case concerning the applicant. She was not charged with any of those offences and there was no suggestion that she was in any way involved in any of those incidents. The fact that counsel for the applicant was not moved by any concern about the possible misuse of the evidence to ask the judge to give any further direction about it confirms my view. 

94The next example misconceives the structure of the summing up. After her Honour had dealt with the elements of each of the offences and briefly summarised the parties' cases in respect of each, she announced that she had completed that subject and was moving ""to some general matters"" (SU 121). She introduced the first of those matters by saying:

You would also recall that there was evidence of other acts led by the Crown, other acts of alleged misconduct by each of the accused, that is Mr Golossian and [AP], towards [MM]. This does not apply, obviously, to [MP], what I am about to say. (SU 121.7)

95Her Honour proceeded to identify the evidence of other sexual activity and gave directions about its relevance and warned against misuse in conventional terms (SU 121 - 125). She then moved to the next of the ""general matters"":

The next direction that I must give you and this applies to both [MM] and [MP] is that in respect of the allegations in respect of either of the complainants you would be aware that the Crown case relies substantially on the evidence of each individual complainant alone. (SU 125.6)

96Her Honour proceeded to give a standard Murray direction: R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19 per Lee J. It included that in considering each complainant's evidence the jury should look to see if it was supported by other evidence. She referred to the Crown case that MM's account was supported by certain evidence which she identified. This was followed by:

Similarly the Crown says the evidence of [MP] is supported by the complaints that she made first to her husband and to [HD] and the Crown says that both complainants' evidence is supported by tendency evidence that I will take you to in a moment and coincidence evidence. (SU 127.1)

97On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that this ""conflated the case"" (AWS 1.1.4 (iii)). The subject of complaint evidence is dealt with next. The subject of tendency evidence is dealt with shortly. Dealing with the present point, I do not accept that there was any inappropriate conflation.

98Next it was submitted that when referring to the evidence of complaint by MP, in the context of which her Honour said ""this applies obviously particularly to the accused Mr Golossian"", a direction should have been given that the evidence of complaint was not admissible against the applicant (AWS 1.1.4(iv)). That is not correct. Given the necessity of the Crown proving in the case concerning her that the complainant had been sexually assaulted, complaint evidence was clearly admissible.

99The next example cited in the applicant's written submissions is that her Honour said, ""Here I will remind you that both complainants told you that they were instructed not to tell anyone and if they did that the curse would get worse or words to that effect"" (SU 128). This was said in the context of the directions on complaint. It immediately followed the conventional component of such directions:

If on the other hand the complainant has not acted in a way you would have expected someone to act after being sexually assaulted as described then that may indicate that the allegations are false. But remember there may be good reasons why a complainant does not raise the allegation immediately and that a failure to do so does not mean the allegation is false or the allegations are false. (SU 128.6)

100Seen in its correct context, there was nothing wrong with her Honour referring to both complainants' evidence that they were threatened with reprisals if they complained.

101The next example is another case of taking a statement by the trial judge out of context. Reference was made to her Honour saying that the Crown case was that each accused had a tendency to have a sexual interest in each of the complainants and to act on that sexual interest. The context in which this was said was:

Dealing now with the counts in the indictment, you are obviously well aware that you have a number of counts or charges in respect of each complainant. The Crown says that each accused has a tendency to have a sexual interest in each of the complainants, that is [MM] or [MP] and to act on that sexual interest by having sexual intercourse with her. By proving the accused whose case you are considering had this sexual interest in that particular complainant, this only applies to the particular complainant whose case you are considering and that he was willing to act on it, the Crown argues you will find it more likely that he committed the other count or counts in the indictment. This obviously applies only to Mr Golossian and [AP], it does not involve [FP]. (SU 132) (Emphasis added)

102Her Honour's removal of the applicant from consideration in relation to this topic could not have been clearer.

103Although it was not referred to in the applicant's written submissions, it is worth mentioning at this point that the next topic dealt with by the trial judge was coincidence evidence. The Crown relied upon the similarities in the way each complainant said that the offences were committed. Her Honour prefaced her directions on this topic by directing:

Again this only involves Mr Golossian and [AP] because you are well aware that [FP] is only charged with the final counts in the indictment in respect of [MP]. (SU 137.1)

104This further served to remind the jury (if it was not already patently obvious) that the evidence concerning MM had nothing to do with the case concerning the applicant. The point was reinforced when her Honour concluded her directions on coincidence evidence by reminding the jury of the competing arguments of the Crown Prosecutor, and counsel for the accused Golossian and the accused AP (SU 139 - 141). Obviously, nothing was said about any submissions made by counsel on this subject that concerned the applicant.

105The penultimate example in the written submissions (AWS 1.1.4 (viii)) is a repetition of some of the previous examples and needs no further discussion. 

106The final example involved reference to her Honour's summary of the closing arguments of counsel. It was submitted that this was done ""in terms which conflated the cases of the [applicant] and her co-accused"". The submission does not fairly acknowledge that the closing arguments commenced on a Thursday morning and concluded the following Wednesday afternoon and her Honour's summary was so brief that it occupied only about five pages of transcript (SU 142 - 147). Many of the points that were made had already been referred to, appropriately, in the course of giving the various legal directions. A review of what her Honour said does not reveal to me any possibility that the jury were invited, or left to think, that evidence that did not properly relate to the applicant was nonetheless available for consideration in the case concerning her.

107Ground 2 is an example of an ""armchair appeal""; counsel picking over the transcript and creating arguments that did not occur to those who had the benefit of the complete atmosphere of the trial. This ground lacks merit and leave to rely upon it pursuant to Rule 4 should be refused. 

Ground 3: The trial judge erred in her directions on tendency, coincidence and context evidence

108As noted earlier, the Crown relied upon tendency evidence within the cases concerning each complainant but not between those two cases. It also relied upon coincidence evidence between the two cases. In the case concerning MM it also relied upon context evidence. None of this evidence was relied upon in the case of the applicant. It was not asserted that she had any relevant tendency. The evidence concerning MM was not available for coincidence reasoning in the jury's assessment of the alleged offences concerning MP. Unlike MM, MP did not give evidence of there having been any uncharged sexual conduct.

109The written submissions for the applicant included a contention that ""it is impossible to see how, on the question of whether one complainant consented, the other complainant's evidence that [she] did not has any probative value"" (AWS 1.2.4). Reliance was placed upon Phillips v R [2006] HCA 4; (2006) 225 CLR 303 and Stubley v Western Australia [2011] HCA 7; (2011) 242 CLR 374. However, on the hearing of the application, Mr Ramage indicated an acceptance of the Crown's written submissions. I take this to be a reference to paragraph 81 of those submissions where the limitation on the use of tendency evidence, which I have set out in the previous paragraph herein, was pointed out.

110Whilst the applicant's written submissions acknowledged that the trial judge had said at the beginning of her directions on tendency evidence, and said again at the beginning of her directions on coincidence evidence, that they did not apply to the case concerning the applicant (SU 132.9 and 137.1), it was nevertheless contended that ""the finding by use of such materials against the co-accused lead almost inevitably to the [applicant's] conviction"" (AWS 1.2.3). The basis of this is the contention that the jury should have been directed that they could not use the evidence of MM to provide support for the evidence of MP when they came to consider the reliability of the latter in respect of the case concerning the applicant (AWS 1.2.5).

111It was also submitted that the trial judge was in error in not complying with a request made by counsel for the accused Golossian to direct the jury as to ""dissimilarities"", after having informed the jury of 15 similarities that the Crown relied upon. This is a point that would only have relevance to the applicant if the coincidence evidence was available for the jury's consideration of her case. It was not, and the trial judge directed the jury to that effect in the clearest of terms.

112I am not persuaded that there was anything erroneous in the manner in which the trial judge directed the jury on tendency and coincidence evidence; particularly given that she had removed it from consideration in the case concerning the applicant. As counsel for the respondent pointed out (CWS [79]), it is a fundamental assumption that juries will act in accordance with directions: Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J and at [31] - [32] per McHugh J; HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [52] per Kirby J and at [353] per Heydon J; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [103] - [110] per Spigelman CJ. There is nothing in the present case that would justify this Court not acting upon that assumption.

113Whilst the statement of this ground includes reference to context evidence, no submission was made on the subject.

114There is no merit in this ground and it is unsurprising that no point was taken at trial. I would refuse leave to rely upon it.

Ground 4: The trial judge erred in her directions on the meaning of ""in company""

115This ground relates to counts 36, 38 and 41 which charged the offences of aggravated sexual assault (s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act). The applicant's conviction in respect of these counts entailed that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, inter alia, that sexual assaults committed by Golossian in the first and second prayer sessions, and by AP in the third prayer session, were committed ""in company"". A strong attack was made as to the adequacy and correctness of the directions given concerning this element, notwithstanding that the directions were the subject of discussion between counsel and the trial judge prior to the summing up, and that the written directions were settled in the light of those discussions.

116It is necessary to review some authorities before setting out what were the essential matters that should have been incorporated in the directions. The judgment of Kirby J in R v Button; R v Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159; (2002) 54 NSWLR 455 contains a useful review but it must be borne in mind that the focus of the analysis there was on whether a sexual assault that was perpetrated some 50 metres away from others could be said to have been committed in their company. (It was held that in the circumstances of the case it could).

117R v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187 was concerned with an offence of robbery in company. Two men were passengers in a taxi and one of them attacked the driver and demanded money. The other man assisted but did not physically strike the driver. It was contended on appeal that the conviction could not be sustained because it was necessary that both men must have physically participated before the robbery could be one committed ""in company"". This contention was rejected. King CJ, with whom Mohr and von Doussa JJ agreed, said (at 191):

A person commits a robbery ... in company where that person participates in the robbery ... together with another or others in the sense that the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons or that the forces of two or more persons are deployed against the victim. It is not necessary that more than one participant actually strike or rob the victim; it is sufficient that the accused and one or more other participants be physically present for the common purpose of robbing ... and of physically participating if required.

118R v Crozier (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 March 1996, unreported) involved an appeal against conviction for an offence of sexual assault in company. The appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant in the back seat of a car while another man sat in the front. The trial judge simply directed the jury, in effect, that the presence of the two men was sufficient for the Crown to have established the ""in company"" element. After quoting the above passage from Brougham, Grove J (Cole JA and Ireland J agreeing) said:

I would apply a similar approach to the allegation of the circumstance of aggravation in this case in assessing the requirements for proof that the alleged offence occurred ""in company"". The evidence does not show that Fitzgerald was other than entirely passive during the action of the Appellant when he returned from his stated intention of urinating and got into the back seat of the car with the complainant. There is no evidence that Fitzgerald was encouraging the Appellant by word or action, indeed the complainant said that she recalled that he may have had a can of drink. It is true that the direction above recited was given without objection by counsel at trial (who did not appear for the Appellant in the appeal) and it may fairly be concluded that the capacity of the evidence to sustain a finding that the alleged offence by the Appellant was committed in company was not explored. Nevertheless in my opinion the evidence could not sustain the circumstance of aggravation specified in the indictment. Even if that conclusion were incorrect the summing up was deficient to the extent that the jury were given no relevant instruction and left to accept that mere presence of another sufficed.

119In R v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14 the offence was one of robbery in company and the appellant had been unsuccessful in applying to withdraw his plea of guilty. There had been a number of versions of the events before the primary judge. Adams J (Abadee and Barr JJ agreeing), inter alia, considered whether the appellant's own version supported the charge. He claimed that he stood in the vicinity of the front door of the victim's premises while she was accosted inside and robbed by two co-offenders. It was at least implicit that the victim was aware of his presence and Adams J observed that he was in a position to assist the other two offenders if necessary. After quoting the above passage from Brougham, his Honour said:

[17] It seems to me that the essence of this offence is not that the accused intended that the victim should be overborne by the presence of more than one robber or that he should intend to come to the assistance of the other if necessary. In my opinion, the only relevant intent is that the offender placed himself in the position in which he knew or expected that the victim would know of his presence and ability to assist in the robbery if called on to do so.

...

[20] In my opinion, presence at the scene with the intention of physically participating, if required, is sufficient to satisfy the section, even if that presence is unknown to the victim. However, if the offender makes his presence known to the victim so that, to use the words of the Chief Justice in Brougham ""the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons"" that will be sufficient to satisfy the section even if the offender did not, as it happened, intend to physically participate if required. 

120In R v Jacobs and Mehajer [2004] NSWCCA 462; (2004) 151 A Crim R 452 at [153], Wood CJ at CL observed that R v Leoni had developed the concept of ""in company"" further than Brougham, having regard to what appears in the second of the paragraphs I have quoted.

121That brings me back to R v Button; R v Griffen. The offence involved a complainant being sexual assaulted by five men in a quarry and then in remote bushland. The last man to attack her took her into the bush about 50 metres away from the others. It was contended on appeal that the physical presence of a co-offender during the commission of the offence was necessary. The proposition was rejected. Kirby J, with the concurrence of Heydon JA and Greg James J, reviewed the foregoing and other authorities and then set out (at [120]) the propositions that emerged from them. Relevantly, those propositions were:


the offenders must share a common purpose to commit the offence in question;


physical presence of one or more other persons is required;


participation in the common purpose, without physical presence, is insufficient; and,


""The perspective of the victim (being confronted by the combined force or strength [of] two or more persons) is relevant, although not determinative. If two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose, they will be 'in company' if the victim is unaware of the other person"".

122Kirby J then turned to consider what ""physical presence"" meant. He described this as ""an elastic concept"" and proceeded to give two hypothetical examples. One was of a sexual assault in a large house involving a number of individuals. He said that it would not necessarily mean there was not the required physical presence if the victim was taken into a bedroom by one offender and the door closed; even if the bedroom was upstairs so that there was some distance separating the offender and the other members of the group. There were limits, however, and these were to be determined according to the following test stated by his Honour (at [125]):

The test is the coercive effect of the group. There must be such proximity as would enable the inference that the coercive effect of the group operated, either to embolden or reassure the offender in committing the crime, or to intimidate the victim into submission.

123The summing up by a trial judge was found by Ipp JA (Buddin and Shaw JJ agreeing) to be in accordance with this test, and thus correct, in R v ITA, supra, at [121]:

[119] Finally, his Honour stated that the next element was that the appellant was in company with AK. His Honour went on to explain what that meant. He said:

""The expression that he was in company with the other person does not mean that the companion needs to physically co-operate in the actions of the sexual assault such as by holding the victim down for example. The two men must have the common intention that the perpetrator will illegally sexually assault the victim in some way by way of sexual intercourse. It is not necessary to show that the intention was for the very type of sexual intercourse that occurs but in general for some form of sexual intercourse. The companion must be somewhere in the physical vicinity of the perpetrator, to the knowledge of the perpetrator. This does not mean that the companion needs to be in this case in the same room in the house. Presence in the same house may be enough if that presence is enough to satisfy the following elements.

There must be such proximity as would give the inference that the companion's presence either (a) encouraged the perpetrator in committing the crime or (b) intimidated the victim into submission"".

[120] The trial judge proceeded to say:

""Now the Crown has put to you yesterday the way in which the Crown says that the presence of AK, at the time that the Crown says the first crime was committed, both encouraged [the appellant] in the commission of the crime and also intimidated [the complainant] into submission to the crime"".

[121] Thus, his Honour directed the jury that, for the offence to have been committed ""in company"", the appellant must have had the common intention with AK that the appellant would illegally sexually assault the complainant by sexual intercourse. He went on to give directions as to the need for physical proximity such as to encourage the perpetrator or intimidate the victim. Accordingly, his Honour's instructions were in accordance with the propositions stated by Kirby J in R v Button (2002) 54 NSWLR 455 to which I refer below.

124Later (at [136] - [140]), after referring to R v Button; R v Griffen, Ipp JA concluded that there was no miscarriage of justice upon the asserted basis that the direction was inadequate or incorrect. However, it was later concluded (at [170]) that the evidence that the two men had a common purpose to sexually assault the complainant was equivocal. A verdict for the non-aggravated form of the offence was substituted.

125It has recently been confirmed that physical presence and the perspective of a victim being confronted by the combined force of more than one person is insufficient; involvement in the common purpose is essential: Markou v R [2012] NSWCCA 64 at [24] - [34] per Macfarlan JA, R S Hulme J and myself agreeing.

126Having regard to these authorities, the direction that the trial judge was required to give to the jury in the present case in relation to counts 36, 38 and 41 involved the following components:

1. that the alleged co-offender (Golossian for counts 36 and 38 and AP in count 41) had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting;

2. that the applicant shared a common purpose that this would occur; and

3. that the applicant was physically present when it occurred, such presence being sufficiently proximate if (a) it afforded encouragement to the alleged co-offender or (b) it operated to intimidate or coerce the complainant.

The directions

127The trial judge gave the jury both oral and written directions. The written directions for count 36 (omitting presently irrelevant material including question trail elements) stated:

Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt:

1. that Tony Golossian had sexual intercourse with [MP]?

2. that the sexual intercourse was without the consent of [MP]?

3. that Tony Golossian knew [MP] was not consenting?

4. that Tony Golossian was in company with another person, namely [FP]?

In company means that both Tony Golossian and [FP] intended Tony Golossian to have sexual intercourse with [MP] and [FP] was present and participating in the offence, at least by encouraging or assisting Tony Golossian. (Emphasis in original)

128Individual written directions were given in relation to each of the three sexual assault counts but they were in identical terms, although in relation to count 41 there was the substitution of AP for Tony Golossian.

129The oral directions in relation to the ""in company"" element in relation to count 36 were:

The final element or question you need to answer in respect to this first count of sexual intercourse or allegation of sexual intercourse is whether ""Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in company with someone else, namely [FP]?"" And again I have set out for you there what in company means and I will elaborate on it to a small extent in a minute.

It means that both the accused Golossian and [FP] intended Mr Golossian to have sexual intercourse with [MP] and that [FP] was present and participating in the offence, at least by encouraging or assisting Mr Golossian as I set out there.

Now these directions that I will give you about someone being in company apply equally where it is someone other than [FP] who is alleged to be in company and I think we have one of those counts which I will come to shortly.

Whether the accused Mr Golossian was in company with [FP] depends on your findings of fact as to the circumstances in which [FP] was present in the motel room. To find that Mr Golossian was in company with her as I have set out in the document you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she shared his intentions that he would have sexual intercourse with [MP] and that she was there participating in the offence at least by encouraging and assisting Mr Golossian.

If [FP] was there with knowledge of what was to take place and she was prepared to assist Mr Golossian in the sense that by her words or conduct she was doing something to bring about or rendering more likely through encouragement or assistance his commission of the offence then she is in company with Mr Golossian. I emphasise mere presence in the room is not sufficient. You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she intended Tony Golossian to have sexual intercourse with [MP] and was there participating in the offence. As I have just said simply being there without that intention and without being part of this agreement is not being in company. Mere presence is not enough. 

I am sure you are well aware essentially the Crown relies on what has been outlined earlier in respect of the administering Zolpidem counts that [FP] was there, that she was the person that purchased the orange juice. She was there in the motel room. If she chose to absent herself by going to the bathroom but was aware of what was to take place she would still be in company. If she went to the bathroom having no knowledge of what Mr Golossian was to do then of course she is not in company. (SU 45-46)

130Her Honour continued by explaining that in respect of the accused Golossian the jury could return a verdict of guilty for an offence of sexual assault pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act if there was a reasonable doubt about the circumstance of aggravation that brought the offence within s 61J. In relation to the accused FP, the jury were directed that if there was a reasonable doubt about the ""in company"" element then they should simply find her not guilty.

131The jury retired for the luncheon adjournment a short time after the directions above were given. The judge invited any applications for clarification or redirection. The Crown Prosecutor invited her Honour to clarify that ""participating in the offence"" did not mean physical participation. The judge said she would give consideration to that over lunch. Mr Evans, counsel for the applicant at trial and junior counsel in this Court, opposed anything further being said in relation to the prosecutor's point but asked that the jury be directed to consider how his client could have assisted or encouraged Golossian if she had been called upon (SU 52). In the end the judge did not say anything further in relation to both of these points.

132The oral directions given in relation to counts 38 and 41 were in briefer terms; the judge declined to repeat the directions of law and confined herself to identifying the evidence upon which the Crown relied (SU 48-50; 58 - 61).

133At the end of the day (the first day of a two day summing up), the trial judge received a variety of submissions from counsel for each of the accused on a variety of issues. They included Mr Evans referring her Honour to R v Button; R v Griffen, supra, on the ""in company"" issue. He submitted, or at least he appears to have submitted because it is not entirely clear from the transcript, that there should be a direction that the Crown was required to prove that the appellant was both present and ""able to influence the events"" (SU 82). The trial judge said nothing further on the subject.

Submissions

134The written submissions for the Crown drew attention to the fact that the written directions the judge proposed to provide to the jury had been the subject of a number of discussions with counsel prior to the summing up. Ultimately there was no dissent in relation to their final form (T3110; 3221-3223). It seems that the only point the applicant's counsel was concerned to make at the time the document was in its final draft was that participation by way of encouragement or assistance by the applicant to the principal offender had to be at the time the sexual assault occurred, as opposed to at some earlier time (T3223.40).

135For the applicant, it was submitted that there were eight errors in the directions concerning ""in company"". I will refer to them by the order in which they were listed in the applicant's written submissions, but I will not deal with them in that order as there was a degree of overlap and they were dealt with in a different order in counsel's oral submissions.

136The first asserted error was that there was a failure to explain that the intention shared by the applicant with Golossian had to be more than that sexual intercourse would take place but that it had to be sexual intercourse without consent.

137In response, the Crown submitted that there was no reasonable possibility that the jury were misled or confused as to the requirement that the intention on the part of the appellant was that her co-accused have sexual intercourse, without the complainant's consent and knowing that she was not consenting. This was because the written and oral directions both clearly set out that these matters concerning consent were part of the essential matters requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt.

138The Crown submission should be accepted. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the real issue in the case was whether sexual intercourse occurred and whether the applicant was aware that it occurred, not whether it was consensual. Senior counsel for the applicant conceded this in the course of oral submissions (31.1.12 at T11.40). 

139Secondly, it was submitted that there was a failure to explain what participating in the offence meant and in this regard, reliance was placed upon R v Brougham, supra. This contention must be rejected. The trial judge told the jury what she meant by ""participating in the offence"", once in the written directions and three times in the extract from the summing up in relation to count 36 quoted above: ""at least by encouraging or assisting Tony Golossian"".

140Allied to this contention was the sixth point listed in the written submissions; that is, the judge ""failed to mention"" that it was necessary to find that not only was the applicant prepared to assist, but prepared to participate by giving physical assistance if required or necessary. This must also be rejected. The authorities I have reviewed earlier make it apparent that this is not a necessary element to establish that an offence was committed ""in company"".

141The third and fifth asserted errors listed in the applicant's written submissions seemed to merge in the course of oral submissions. It was contended that the direction failed to reflect the difference between this charge (that is, ""in company"") and accessory before the fact, and that it introduced a false notion of ""rendering more likely"". It was submitted that the direction given was one appropriate for accessorial liability. I do not accept this submission. A key element, as the above authorities make plain, is that the applicant shared a common purpose that the offence in question be committed. What the trial judge said in that respect cannot be impugned, but she did not limit the direction to just that aspect. 

142I suspect the applicant's complaint in this Court derives from the obvious and laudable attempt by the trial judge to avoid legal jargon, such as the term ""common purpose"". She said on a number of occasions during the course of discussions with counsel about the summing up that she would avoid using jargon wherever possible. As I have indicated earlier, it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied that the applicant shared a common purpose with her co-accused and that she was present at the commission of the offence, with such presence operating either to encourage the co-accused or coerce the complainant. So much was conveyed by her Honour's reference to ""present and participating in the offence, at least by encouraging or assisting [the co-accused]"". 

143If anything, the direction pitched the burden that lay on the Crown at a level higher than needed. In the oral directions, her Honour spoke of the applicant, ""by her words or conduct she was doing something to bring about or rendering more likely"". This may be thought to suggest that the applicant's presence having one or the other of the effects I have mentioned was not enough and that more was required. More is not required. The Criminal Trials Bench Book, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, suggests a most succinct direction (in the context of an offence of aggravated indecent assault) which is in accordance with the authorities (at [5-680]):

The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed in the company of another person. If two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose to indecently assault the alleged victim they will be ""in company"", even if the alleged victim is unaware of the other person[s].

[If it is in dispute as to whether [the accused] was in company, add:

The Crown must prove that the coercive effect of the group operated, either to embolden or reassure [the accused] in committing the crime alleged, or to intimidate [the alleged victim] into submission. The perspective of [the alleged victim] (being confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons) is relevant, but does not solely decide the issue.

Participation in the common purpose without being physically present (for example, as being a look-out or previously encouraging [the accused] to commit the offence) is not enough. (Emphasis in original)

144The eighth asserted error was that the trial judge should have acceded to a request by counsel for the applicant (the only point he raised after the directions in relation to counts 36 and 38 were given) that the jury be invited to consider how the applicant could have encouraged or assisted the principal offender if she had been called upon. For the reasons just discussed, this was unnecessary.

145The fourth asserted error was stated to be that the direction ""failed to bring home to the jury that her words or conduct had to be knowingly in the sense of directed towards that purpose"". Nothing further was said about this in either the written or oral submissions. I do not understand it and it was not something that was raised by counsel at the trial. Accordingly, I do not propose to try and divine what the complaint is.

146The seventh asserted error concerned the applicant's evidence that while Golossian was praying over the complainant, she absented herself from the room by going to the adjoining bathroom and saying prayers. The complainant did not positively assert that the applicant was actually present during the precise times that the sexual assaults occurred. She was, effectively, blindfolded. Complaint was made about the trial judge having included in the oral directions:

If she chose to absent herself by going to the bathroom but was aware of what was to take place she would still be in company. (SU 46.8)

147The statement should be understood in context. It was immediately followed by:

If she went to the bathroom having no knowledge of what Mr Golossian was to do then of course she is not in company.

148The point her Honour was conveying was the requirement that the applicant shared a common purpose; part of which involved her being aware of what Golossian intended.

149It was submitted that the direction ""ignored the rationale of a charge of this nature ... the impact on the victim of being confronted by more than one offender. There has to be such physical proximity that the coercive effect [of] the group operated to embolden the offender or to intimidate the victim"" (AWS p.10). 

150It is true that the direction made no mention of intimidation of the complainant. There was no evidence of that. The focus of the direction was on the other way in which the applicant's physical presence could be sufficient to make out the ""in company"" element, that is, encouragement of the principal offender. It was open to the jury to find that just because the applicant was in the adjoining bathroom during the time that sexual penetration occurred, but present in the actual room immediately before and immediately after, the quality of her presence was still sufficient for her to be ""in company"". The principal offender knew that she was present, either immediately or a very short distance away in the bathroom. It was open to the jury to find that she encouraged him by way of assisting with preparatory acts and by the reassuring element that her presence provided for the complainant. Indeed, so long as the applicant had the necessary knowledge of what was to occur, and shared that purpose with the principal offender, any finding to the contrary would be perverse.

151It must also be borne in mind that the offence involved a series of acts; of particular importance was the administration of the drug which was relevant to the issues of consent and knowledge of the lack of it. There was no issue about the applicant being in the direct presence of the complainant (in the room) at the time that this must have occurred. 

152A similar issue arose in R v Button; R v Griffen, supra, where the appellant Griffen submitted that physical presence was required at the moment of penetration. Kirby J said this on the subject:

[100] Hence the Crown must, according to the appellant, prove that sexual intercourse took place in company, that is the physical presence of another person or persons. Sexual intercourse is defined, relevantly, as penetration. According to the appellant, penetration must therefore take place in the physical presence of another person.

[101] There is force in these arguments, although they choose to concentrate upon one aspect of the offence, namely the act of sexual intercourse, that is, penetration. That aspect is obviously fundamental. However, the offence involves other elements, namely, an absence of consent, and knowledge, on the part of the offender, that the victim is not consenting. How should the offence be defined for the purposes of determining whether it occurs ""in company""?

[102] It is not difficult to think of situations where defining the offence by reference to the act of penetration may seem unreasonable. Assume that a group of men bound and gagged a female at one location. Assume, somewhat incongruously, that out of concern for each other's privacy, they made an arrangement whereby each member of the group would, in rotation, have sexual intercourse with the victim, whilst other members waited their turn one hundred metres away in the bush. The victim, in that example, would be powerless because of the actions of the group. Yet penetration would, in each case, occur in the absence of other members of the group. Is it not aggravated sexual assault in company? If it is, is there a difference where, as here, instead of binding and gagging the victim, her will is broken by the group at one location, and penetration, for reasons of privacy, takes place at another?

153In the end (at [121] - [122]), Kirby J found it unnecessary to decide this issue because of his conclusion that there was physical presence, notwithstanding the distance of some 50 metres, at the time of penetration.

154It is similarly unnecessary in the present case to decide this issue as I am not persuaded that there was anything erroneous in the direction that was given. It is possible, however, that the trial judge could have gone further by referring to the applicant's admitted immediate presence in the room at the time key elements of the events occurred. That, however, would not have assisted the applicant.

155There is no merit in any of the complaints now raised on behalf of the applicant. The only complaint that was raised at trial was that concerning a factual matter that counsel invited the judge to ask the jury to consider. Leave is required where a ground of appeal involves other than a question of law alone: s 5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act. This complaint involves, in part, a question of fact. All of the other complaints are caught by rule 4.

156I propose that leave to rely upon ground 4 be refused.

Ground 5 The trial judge erred in her directions on conspiracy

157Count 42 of the indictment alleged that Golossian, AP and the applicant, between 26 January and 5 June 2008 at Enfield and elsewhere did conspire with each other to enable AP to have sexual intercourse with MP without her consent and knowing she was not consenting. 

158The first submission made in relation to this ground was that the trial judge directed the jury that they needed to be satisfied that there was an agreement by two or more of the accused, but did not say in respect of the applicant that they needed to be satisfied that she was a party to such an agreement. However, it is then immediately noted (AWS 1.4.1) that the trial judge subsequently told the jury that in considering the applicant's case they needed to be satisfied that she was a party to an agreement with at least one of the other accused (SU 70). This was in response to a request by trial counsel (SU 68.2) at the next break after the judge had directed the jury as to the conspiracy. At the same time, counsel said, ""In relation to count 42, the conspiracy count, there's no cavil with the way it's set out"". 

159Despite that, counsel for the applicant submitted in this Court (AWS p 11) that the directions were deficient in that:

1.there was no reference to the complainant not consenting;

2.there was no reference to what words and conduct were relied upon by the Crown;

3.there was no reference to the need for the jury to be satisfied that there was an agreement before the acts, statements and conduct of a co-conspirator became admissible;

4.there was an invitation to use evidence of phone calls and text messages involving the co-accused of which there was no evidence of the applicant having any awareness; and

5.there was error in declining a request to remind the jury of a factual matter that was ""an important plank in the defence case"".

160The first complaint has no merit. The written directions required the jury to consider whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of three matters, the first two of which were:

1. [T]hat there was an agreement between at least two of Tony Golossian, [AP] and [FP] to commit an unlawful act, namely for [AP] to have sexual intercourse with [MP] without her consent knowing she was not consenting.

2. [T]hat [FP] agreed with either Tony Golossian and/or [AP] that [AP] would have sexual intercourse with [MP] without her consent knowing she was not consenting.

161If that was not enough, it was repeated three times in the oral directions (SU 62.3, 64.1 and 64.7).

162The second complaint is also without foundation. During the course of her directions as to the elements of the conspiracy count, the trial judge told the jury that the Crown case was circumstantial and proceeded to provide a ""by no means ... exhaustive list"" of some of the circumstances that the Crown relied upon (SU 63.4).

163The third and fourth complaints confuse a question of admissibility of evidence, a matter for the trial judge, with evidence that had been admitted and was available for the jury's consideration of the conspiracy count. The acts of the co-accused were relevant to the jury's determination of whether there was any conspiratorial agreement as the Crown alleged. Whether the applicant was a participant in such an agreement was a matter to be determined by her own words and conduct. This was not a case in which the acts of others bore upon that question. Moreover, there was no issue taken by trial counsel, nor could there have been, about her Honour's statement, when speaking of the need for the Crown to prove that there was an agreement:

Again I remind you, you must consider the case against each accused separately, the evidence against each of the accused may include evidence relating to what an accused said and did but it may also include what was said or done by other people alleged to be involved in the agreement. (SU 62.2)

164The final matter refers to a request by trial counsel that the judge remind the jury of a submission that he had made in his closing address. This is a matter that will be discussed later under Ground 12 where the applicant's submission is, in essence, repeated.

165Oral submissions on the applicant's behalf in relation to this ground were in large part devoted to the relevance and sufficiency of evidence available to support the jury's verdict for the conspiracy count. I propose to say something more about that in connection with unreasonable verdict ground.

166As with the previous ground, rule 4 applies except in relation to the last of the asserted errors but it also requires leave as it does not involve a question of law alone. None of the applicant's contentions under this ground have any merit and I propose that leave be refused.

Ground 6: The trial judge erred in her directions on the criminal standard

167At a very early stage of the summing up the trial judge gave directions as to the onus and standard of proof in unremarkable and unembellished terms which are not the subject of any challenge. However, on the second day of the summing up a written question in these terms was received from the jury:

The Crown must prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. I am confused and do not understand adequately the concept of the phrase beyond reasonable doubt. I would appreciate if you could give us a guidance or legal meaning of this phrase when used in the assessment of the defendants' guilt.

168In the course of discussing this note with counsel the judge indicated that she proposed saying that the phrase comprised ordinary English words (SU 111.4). Trial counsel for the applicant submitted that, in the context of circumstantial evidence, her Honour should direct the jury that if there was an alternative explanation available ""that would appear to you to be open as reasonable people, well then if you can't eliminate that, that's reasonable doubt"" (SU 111.6). The Crown Prosecutor opposed this submission on the basis that the case was not entirely circumstantial. The judge indicated that she would think about it during the forthcoming morning adjournment. Upon resumption, the following direction as given:

Those three words, beyond reasonable doubt, are ordinary English words and they carry their ordinary meaning. Whether a doubt is reasonable is, for you as the jury, to say by setting your own standards. You may feel that is not of great assistance to you but I am constrained by the law by what I can say to you about those words, but I will just repeat, they are ordinary English words and carry their ordinary meaning. (SU 118) (Emphasis added)

169Her Honour then immediately proceeded to refer to circumstantial evidence and said that the Crown case concerning the applicant was entirely circumstantial. She directed the jury that if there was another reasonable explanation for the facts proved by the evidence which was inconsistent with the guilt of the accused then the verdict should be not guilty because that would mean the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (SU 118 - 119). Trial counsel took no issue with what the judge said in either respect.

170The complaint in this ground relates to the emphasised portion of the direction set out above. It was submitted that this ""was no part of the direction approved in Green and was potentially misleading"" (AWS 1.5.3). This was a reference to Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 32. There was no elaboration of the submission in writing and little orally; Mr Ramage simply contended that ""an invitation to set their own standards, whatever they may be, is a slightly dangerous course and it would have been better for her to have said exactly where she was under the law in Green [sic] because this was particularly the case where one would find it very difficult to apply ordinary standards"" (31.1.12 at T27.25).

171In Green v The Queen, in the course of criticising as erroneous a trial judge's attempt to explain the term ""beyond reasonable doubt"", the High Court (Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Owen JJ) explained (at 32-33):

A reasonable doubt is a doubt which the particular jury entertain in the circumstances. Jurymen themselves set the standard of what is reasonable.

172In R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 117, Hunt CJ at CL said that it was not necessary, nor desirable, to tell a jury that whether a doubt is reasonable is for the jury to say by setting their own standards, ""unless something is said by counsel during the course of the trial, or unless the jury asks a question, which warrants elaboration or explanation beyond the conventional direction"".

173In R v Southammavong; R v Sihavong [2003] NSWCCA 312, the trial judge had told the jury that ""the words 'beyond reasonable doubt' are ordinary everyday words and that is how you should understand them"". Later in response to a jury question seeking elaboration of the term, the judge confined himself to repeating what he had already said. The Court (Spigelman CJ, O'Keefe and Greg James JJ agreeing) held that there was no error in what was said. Spigelman CJ referred with approval (at [35]) to the judgment of King CJ in The Queen v Wilson (1986) 42 SASR 203 in which it was said (at 206):

No attempt should be made to explain or define reasonable doubt. If amplification is desired it should go no further than to tell the jury that a reasonable doubt is one that they as reasonable persons are prepared to entertain.

174In R v Southammavong; R v Sihavong the jury's question was:

""[C]an you provide some more clarification around what a reasonable doubt means, i.e. is it our own individual view, or is there a more independent definition?""

175It was contended that the trial judge had erred by not directly responding to the question. It was submitted that it was ""obligatory"" for the judge to have directed the jury that a reasonable doubt was to be determined in accordance with the jury's opinion, rather than in terms of an ""independent definition"". Spigelman CJ referred to what I have extracted above (at [173]) from Green v The Queen, and other authorities, in support of the proposition that ""the relevant test is a subjective one and it applies to each individual juror"". He continued:

[33] ... [I]t would have been desirable for the trial judge to answer the jury question in terms, i.e. by saying words to the effect that it was the respective individual opinions as to what level of 'doubt' was 'reasonable' that applied. The issue before this Court is whether his Honour erred in failing to do so.

[34] In my opinion Mr Game's submission that it was at least permissible for his Honour to answer the question that the meaning of reasonable doubt was a matter for the jury rather than for some ""definition"" of a character identified in the question as ""independent"" is correct. The issue is whether or not there was legal error in his Honour's failure to do so.

176Reference was then made to other aspects of the summing up. Ultimately, Spigelman CJ considered:

[44] ... whether or not, as a matter of substance, the trial judge's response to the jury question was sufficient to make it clear to the jury that there was no definition of a ""independent"", or objective character of the formulation ""beyond reasonable doubt"" and that the jury members themselves, individually, set the standard of what was reasonable in terms of a doubt in the particular circumstances of the trial. His Honour did not do so in the specific terms of the jury question. It would have been preferable if he had. However, I have come to the conclusion that, as a matter of substance, his Honour did answer the question. (Emphasis added)

177The impugned portion of the trial judge's response to the jury question in the present case is in very similar terms to that which Spigelman CJ regarded as a desirable response to the question posed in that case. The difference between the two cases is, of course, that the jury question in the present case was only concerned with the meaning of the phrase ""beyond reasonable doubt"". The first sentence of the judge's response adequately dealt with that question. The question did not require the additional clarification as to whether it is an ""independent"" or ""objective"" standard as opposed to jury members setting their own standard.

178A usefully thorough review of the many cases concerned with this issue appears in the judgment of Simpson J in RWB v R; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147; (2010) 202 A Crim R 209. In that case, the trial judge embellished the direction as to the standard of proof of his own volition. Whilst it was held that it was wrong for the judge to have done so, what was said was found not to constitute a miscarriage of justice. It did not diminish the standard of proof and was not misleading or confusing as other attempts at elaboration by trial judges had been found to be. The unnecessary addition to the response given by the judge in the present case can be similarly characterised.

179Once again, rule 4 applies. I am unpersuaded that there was any miscarriage of justice or such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that goes to the root of the proceedings. I would refuse leave to rely upon this ground.

Ground 7: The trial judge erred in her directions on assistance

180The written submissions for the applicant on this ground were short and sought to explain it as follows:

1.6.1 At SU 57 the trial judge directed that assisting in the commission of a crime ""may be effected by helping to set the stage"". She gave a similar direction at SU 96 in connection with the unrelated matters of [MM] ...

1.6.2 Assuming the jury followed the direction, they were likely to have convicted on the simple basis that the Appellant [sic] had either booked the motel rooms or with respect to the conspiracy charge, been absent from her home.

181In oral submissions, reference was made to the summing up (at SU 57) but there was no elaboration of the basis for this ground. 

182The submissions, and the ground for that matter, were entirely misconceived. The passage identified in the summing up was concerned with directions given in relation to the co-accused AP in relation to count 39 where he was charged with being an accessory before the fact to the administration by either Golossian or the applicant of Zolpidem to MP with the intention of enabling him (AP) to have sexual intercourse without her consent. The directions were relevant to AP's alleged accessorial liability. They had nothing to do with the culpability of the applicant for this, or any other, count.

183For these reasons it is clear why no complaint was raised at the trial. Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Ground 8: The trial judge erred in her directions on lack of consent through terror

184The written submissions in relation to this ground were also brief and may be quoted in full:

1.7.1 At SU 49 the judge directed the jury regarding lack of consent through terror that the law was that ""whether those threats against, or the terror is instilled in that person, or any other person"".

1.7.2 It is submitted that this direction was not only wrong but inevitably must have lead to confusion on the part of the jury.

185The submissions did not condescend to inform the Court, or the Crown, why the direction was wrong, nor why it led to confusion. In oral submissions it was put that the words ""or any other person"" were irrelevant (T28.13 31.1.12). There was no explanation as to why this was so.

186In contrast to the unsatisfactory nature of the applicant's submissions, the written submissions for the Crown identify the counts for which there was an issue of consent; set out the applicable law (s 61HA Crimes Act), as well as the written and oral directions; identify the evidence that was relevant to the issue; and then present argument as to why the directions were not erroneous. This contrast in the diligence and care with which the parties' submissions were presented is not confined to this ground.

187The short answer to this ground is that the Crown case was that terror had been instilled in both MP and her husband over a period of many weeks leading up to the second prayer session, which was what the judge was talking about at SU 49. MP had been put in fear of dire consequences if she did not co-operate and undergo the prayer sessions and she was aware that her husband was similarly fearful. The reference to ""any other person"" was not erroneous.

188There is no merit in this ground and once again it is unsurprising that the point was not taken by the applicant's counsel at trial. Leave to rely upon it should be refused.

Ground 9: The trial judge erred in giving a series of directions on how the culpability of the Appellant arose

189A series of complaints about the summing up are made under this ground. 

190The first complaint is that the trial judge told the jury (at SU 32) that the Crown relied on ""what Golossian had said to [MP] before she drank the orange juice"" (AWS 1.8.1). No attempt was made in the written submissions to identify the context in which this was said. Nevertheless, it was submitted that this should have been accompanied by a direction that there was no evidence the applicant heard what Golossian had said, or adopted it, and that it could not be used against the applicant unless the jury had already determined that she was in agreement that the drug be administered. Of course, the judge was not asked by the applicant's counsel to say anything of the sort.

191As the Crown's written submissions point out, the complaint is once again misconceived. The judge commenced giving directions about the first count in the indictment (count 35) in which MP was the complainant at page 30 of the summing up transcript. Count 35 alleged that Golossian and the applicant administered to MP an intoxicating substance with the intention of enabling Golossian to sexually assault her. The impugned passage appears two pages later when her Honour was still dealing with the first element, that an intoxicating substance was administered to the complainant. Her Honour referred to various aspects of the evidence and reminded the jury that the question of whether a drug had been administered was a live issue, counsel for the applicant's two co-accused having each submitted that there was a reasonable possibility that despite her denials, MP had in fact taken sleeping medication herself. It was in this context that the judge said:

The Crown also relies on what [MP] told you was said to her by the accused Golossian before she drank the orange juice at page 120 [of the transcript of which the jury had a copy]. He said, ""It will feel like an angel [will] be entering my body, if I feel dizzy or unwell, basically was there if angels had entered and it is a good thing not to be afraid. He was telling me a lot of things, it is going to feel 100 per cent like it is 100 per cent real but it is not, it is just a dream"". (SU 32)

192This was clearly a relevant matter for the Crown to rely upon in relation to the first question the trial judge posed for the jury in relation to the s 38 offence alleged to have been committed at the first ""prayer session"", i.e. whether an intoxicating substance had been administered to the complainant. What the judge said above was said in the context of her giving the jury directions concerning the charge facing the co-accused Golossian. However, it is not correct to say, as the Crown submitted, that it did not apply to the applicant (CWS [191]). After the judge had dealt with all of the elements of this offence concerning Golossian, she then said that with one exception (presently irrelevant), the elements of the offence concerning the applicant were identical to those concerning Golossian and so the conclusions the jury arrived at concerning him would be the same for her (SU 41.5).

193The Crown was correct, however, in submitting that the evidence was relevant and admissible against the applicant on the contention that she was a participant with Golossian in a joint criminal enterprise. Moreover, there was no objection taken by the applicant to the admissibility of the evidence or the use that the Crown sought to make of it, and no complaint was raised about what the trial judge said about it.

194The second complaint (AWS 1.8.2) was that the judge gave misleading directions to the jury on intent (at SU 36 - 37). This was a reference to the judge explaining to the jury how a person's intention may be inferred by reference to the person's actions. She gave the example of a person hitting another on the head with a hammer, giving rise to the inference that the person intended to inflict serious bodily injury. Appropriately, she immediately reminded the jury that they were concerned with the intention of the accused and not of some theoretical person. 

195The submission that this example invited the jury to conclude that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions is unfounded (AWS 1.8.2 and 31.1.12 at T29). This direction was given in the context of the judge directing the jury as to the requirement for the Crown to prove that the administration of the drug (if the jury were first satisfied that occurred) was intended by Golossian to enable him to sexually assault the complainant. Her Honour then reminded the jury of various aspects of the evidence upon which the Crown invited the jury to draw that inference. I can see nothing wrong with the terms of the direction in this respect.

196In conjunction with this complaint, it was submitted that the jury should have been directed that they needed to be satisfied that the applicant was aware that Golossian was administering the drug for the purpose of having sexual intercourse without consent. The short answer to that is that they were. The final element in the written directions concerning the applicant and count 35 was:

[T]hat at the time Zolpidem was administered, both [FP] and Tony Golossian intended it to enable Tony Golossian to have sexual intercourse with [MP] without her consent, knowing she was not consenting.

197The next complaint was that the judge gave ""insufficient and misleading directions with respect to Count 3A [sic] ... that the accused Golossian and [FP] had agreed to administer Zolpidem"" (AWS 1.8.3). Submissions that were made in relation to the sufficiency of evidence in relation to this point may be left in abeyance. It was also submitted that ""the jury had to be made aware that the agreement had to be that ... the purpose of that administration [of the drug] was so Golossian would have sexual intercourse without consent"". Again, the answer to that submission lies in the written directions to which I have just referred.

198The final complaint under this ground is a contention of error in directing the jury that the Crown could not prove who out of the applicant and Golossian administered the drug, but that the circumstances were such that one or the other must have. It was submitted that the direction ""confused the roles of principal and accessory"". 

199To put this in context, the trial judge said:

The Crown says that you can conclude from what took place in the prayer [sic - motel] room that there was an agreement between the accused Golossian and [FP] to administer Zolpidem to [MP]. The Crown, as I say, cannot prove who it was who administered the Zolpidem, but says in the circumstances that one or other of them must have done it and that they were both there participating in the crime, at least to the extent of being ready to assist if required. (SU 39 - 40)

200This appears in the context of the judge directing the jury that the Crown case was that Golossian and the applicant were participants in a joint criminal enterprise. The Crown relied upon a variety of circumstances in support of the inference that this was so and the judge briefly reminded the jury:

The Crown relies on the circumstances that [FP] bought the juice [which was laced with the drug], that she was in the room [when it was ingested], that she reassured [MP] in advance that it would feel real but it was only a dream, and that she helped [MP] into the shower afterwards [because of her drugged state]. (SU 40)

201The manner in which the Crown case was put, and the way in which the judge reminded the jury, was the only logical and sensible way in which the case could be put. According to the order in which the judge set out the essential elements of the offence, before the jury could consider this issue they had to be satisfied that the drug was administered to the complainant. If they were satisfied that it was, they were then required to consider whether Golossian acted alone in doing this (in which case the jury were directed to acquit the applicant) or whether there was a joint criminal enterprise between Golossian and the applicant that the drug would be administered. If the jury were satisfied that the applicant was a participant in such an enterprise, it did not matter which of the two administered the drug: Mohan v The Queen [1967] 2 AC 187 at 195; R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25 at 35; Clough v R (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 at 399; R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29; (2001) 53 NSWLR 480 at [65], [90].

202None of these complaints have any merit. They did not move the applicant's counsel to raise any complaint at trial. Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Ground 10: The trial judge erred in failing to properly or adequately direct the jury with respect to the law that the jury should apply to their consideration of the sexual assault counts (Counts 36, 38 and 41). In particular the trial judge failed to direct the jury that they could only find these offences proven against the Appellant if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:-


Golossian had committed the offences of sexual intercourse with [MP] without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting; 
the Appellant was present at the time the offence was committed; 
the Appellant at the time knew all the circumstances necessary to show the crime was committed by Golossian; and 
with that knowledge the Appellant intentionally assisted or encouraged Golossian to commit the crime in the company of Golossian.

203This was a new ground added by leave granted during the course of the hearing.

204The directions that were given to the jury in relation to the sexual assault counts have been referred to earlier in relation to ground 4 (at [126]-[127]). They served to make plain to the jury that each of the matters identified in the current ground were subject to the requirement that they be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt, either explicitly or in substance.

205The written submissions for the Crown included a concession that the judge had not directed the jury to be satisfied ""that the [applicant] knew all the essential facts or circumstances necessary to show that the crime was committed by her co-accused"" (CWS [23]). It was contended nonetheless that there was no miscarriage of justice (CWS [24]). Mr Ramage stated (31.1.12 at T33.49) that he did not disagree with the proposition in the Crown's submissions that:

[336] Failure to direct on an element will not necessarily result in a miscarriage of justice: Holland v R (1993) 117 ALR 193 at 200; Handlen v R [2011] HCA 51 at [80] and the cases cited therein.

206The directions that the judge gave on the ""in company"" element subsumed this element of liability. If there was any misdirection it was technical but not material and it did not amount to miscarriage.

207No complaint was raised by trial counsel for the applicant in relation to these matters. Counsel had the advantage of the discussions which took place before the summing up and the further advantage of having seen the directions in written form in the document proposed to be distributed to the jury. In these circumstances it seems safe to assume that it was a considered decision by counsel not to suggest that the directions were in any way erroneous. Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Ground 11: The trial judge gave insufficient directions on consent

208The written submissions for the applicant in relation to this ground were brief: 
1.9.1 At SU 44 the trial judge failed to direct the jury that it was not sufficient that they found that, if [MP] had sexual intercourse while substantially intoxicated or because of intimidating or coercive conduct or other threat, that, even if ... that was so, the jury had to find, on the evidence admissible against the Appellant, that the Appellant was aware that that was the situation with [MP] at the time.

209As elusive as that submission is, Mr Ramage informed the Court during oral submissions that he did not wish to add to it (31.1.12 at T29.50).

210There was no issue as to consent in respect of any of the sexual assault counts. Golossian denied that sexual intercourse occurred in relation to counts 36, 38 and 41. AP denied being present during the third ""prayer session"" and thus denied the allegation that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant on that occasion. The applicant's case was that she was unaware of any sexual activity occurring on each of the three occasions; if it occurred, she did not know about it because it must have happened when she was in the bathroom. Nobody suggested that sexual activity occurred but that it might possibly have been consensual. 

211Despite there being no issue about it, the applicant's knowledge of the complainant's lack of consent remained an essential matter for the jury to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt. There was no clear and explicit instruction to this effect in relation to any of counts 36, 38 and 41. However, by their verdicts of guilty in respect of the s 38 offences the jury indicated satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was involved in the administration of an intoxicating substance with the intention of enabling Golossian (counts 35 and 37) and AP (count 39) to have sexual intercourse with MP without her consent, knowing she was not consenting. By their verdicts of guilty in respect of the s 61J offences, the jury indicated satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that Golossian (counts 36 and 38) and AP (count 41) in fact had the sexual intercourse without consent as the applicant had intended. 

212Moreover, the directions the trial judge gave on the ""in company"" element carried with it, although not in express terms, the requirement that the applicant knew that MP was not consenting. They required the jury to be satisfied that the applicant was ""present and participating in the offence, at least by encouraging or assisting [the co-accused]"" (written directions (MFI 80 at pp. 4, 6 and 19); SU 45.7). ""The offence"" was obviously a reference to the co-accused having sexual intercourse without the complainant's consent.

213In these circumstances I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage of justice occasioned by the lack of a precise instruction as to the applicant's knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. The substance of such an instruction was effectively conveyed to the jury and there is no reason to doubt that the jury was satisfied of this element in relation to each of counts 36, 38 and 41. Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Ground 12: The trial judge summed up the Appellant's case insufficiently

214At an early stage of the summing up the trial judge gave ""a very brief summary"" of the applicant's evidence. This was useful at that point because it immediately followed directions given to the jury about evidence of the applicant's good character. Those directions included:

The fact that she is a person of good character supports her credibility, it is a factor which she is entitled to have you take into account when you decide whether you accept her explanation to the police in the interview, and whether you accept her evidence which she gave you in the witness box. (SU 22.2) 

215The judge then reminded the jury of the overall effect of the ""evidence which she gave you in the witness box"":

A very brief summary of [FP's] evidence was that her presence at the hotel, motels, and the prayer sessions, was not part of any agreement with Mr Golossian and/or [AP], that she was there as the sister-in-law of [MP], and at [MP's] request, and [GK's] request, that if any offences were committed she was no part of it. (SU 22.5)

216The written submissions for the applicant assert:

1.10.1 At SU 22 [the trial judge] summed up the Appellant's case in a way which put the Appellant in a situation that the jury should almost inevitably, find against her. The Appellant's case was not that she was not part of any agreement. Her case was that she was not part of any agreement whereby Golossian or [AP] was to achieve sexual intercourse with [MP] without the latter's consent.

217Two things may be immediately observed. First, the impugned passage, a single sentence, did not amount to a summing up of the applicant's case and it was clearly not intended to be. It was ""a very brief summary"" to remind the jury of the broad effect of the applicant's evidence, rather than her case. Secondly, the reference by her Honour to the applicant's evidence being that she was ""not part of any agreement"" must most obviously have been understood by the jury as being that she was ""not part of any agreement whereby Golossian or [AP] was to achieve sexual intercourse with [MP] without the latter's consent"". 

218In an endeavour to explain the submission that the jury ""should almost inevitably find against [the applicant]"" it was submitted at the hearing of the application that ""clearly the jury were going to find that she was party to some sort of agreement, she was to be present when the prayer sessions took place"" (31.1.12 at T30.10). There is no merit in that contention whatsoever. It fails to give any credit to the intelligence of the 12 members of the jury. It ignores the fact that throughout the summing up there were references to the applicant's case being that she was unaware of any intention by anyone to sexually assault the complainant. For example, after responding to the jury's question about the meaning of ""beyond reasonable doubt"" and explaining that in a circumstantial evidence case a conclusion of guilt must be the only conclusion open on the facts found, the trial judge said:

And, as I suggested to you yesterday, the Crown case is that there is only one reasonable conclusion that you would come to on the whole of the evidence in respect of [FP] and that is that she is guilty of the charges which she faces because she was part of this overall agreement. The accused [FP's] case is, as you are well aware, she was not part of any agreement and that she was merely present in the room and had no knowledge of any criminal offence being committed and so that is an example that the accused [FP] says there is another reasonable explanation available on the evidence and that is, ""yes, I was there, but, no, I had no knowledge of"", for example, ""[AP] intending to have sexual intercourse with [MP] or any knowledge of the accused Golossian intending to have sexual intercourse with [MP]"". (SU 119)

219A further complaint under this ground is that the trial judge did not remind the jury of certain evidence. Three matters are the subject of complaint but before turning to them it is well to recall what was said in Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560 - 561 in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ:

In a criminal trial, the distinction between directions on matters of law and directions on matters of fact or argument is fundamental. A trial judge is bound to direct the jury as to any principle of law or rule of practice applicable to the case, and a misdirection or non-direction on such a matter will usually mean that the trial has miscarried. But matters of fact and the arguments in relation to them are in a different category. A trial judge is not bound to discuss all the evidence or to analyse all the conflicts in the evidence, and, by itself, the failure of a trial judge to do so does not mean that there has been any miscarriage of justice. Section 405AA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which came into force after the trial of the appellant, provides that a judge of the Supreme or District Court need not summarise ""the evidence given in the trial"" if he or she is of the opinion that in all the circumstances a summary is not necessary. Nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury. But that requirement does not oblige the judge to put to the jury every argument put forward by counsel for the accused. This court has said that it ""is hardly necessary to say that as a reason for granting a new trial, after a conviction in a criminal case, it is not enough that the presiding judge has not mentioned to the jury all the matters which were set up on behalf of the accused as affecting probabilities"". Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence. Consequently, the conduct of the case necessarily bears on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on or discuss the evidence. Discussion or comment which is justified or required in one case may be neither required nor justified when a similar case is conducted in a different way. (Citation of authority omitted)

220It is also well to observe that the summing up, which spanned almost two whole days, was preceded by four full days of addresses by counsel and the general theme of the summing up was to intersperse the legal directions with references to how the respective parties put their cases. It was only at the very end that the trial judge gave a brief overview of some of the arguments presented in the closing addresses. To have reminded the jury of every point sought to be made by counsel would have added several hours at least. It should also be borne in mind that the jury had a transcript of all of the evidence (T3046).

221The jury were not misled by the judge's summary into thinking that it comprised the totality of the arguments that had been put to them. Her Honour prefaced this final stage of the summing up by saying:

I am now, members of the jury, going to very briefly summarise counsels' addresses. You have had the benefit of competent and careful addresses. I would not do justice to their addresses were I now to try to repeat everything that each of them said and I think some of them went more than a day, so this is a very, very brief summary. (SU 141)

222The first matter that it is said the judge should have reminded the jury of was the evidence of an expert, Ajoy Ghosh, who was called in the applicant's case concerning communications between Golossian's phone and the applicant's phone. Mr Ghosh's evidence warranted only a brief mention in the closing address of the applicant's counsel; 11 lines of transcript in an address recorded over 26 pages (T3162.43). The point could not have been regarded by counsel as sufficiently important to warrant a request that the judge remind the jury of it.

223The applicant contends that the judge should have reminded the jury of evidence concerning the $50,000 that she received from GK. The Crown case was that part of the applicant's motivation related to this money. There was a dispute as to whether $24,000 of it was used to pay the deposit on a house on 2 June 2008; the applicant claimed that she used money from another source for that purpose. Resolution of this dispute by the jury was relatively unimportant and so it is unsurprising that trial counsel did not ask the judge to remind the jury of it. Even if the jury determined the issue in favour of the applicant, the fact remained that the applicant did receive the $50,000 from GK and she gave evidence that she had spent about half of it (T2883.20).

224The final complaint under this ground is that the judge should have reminded the jury of ""objective evidence suggesting that the [applicant] was totally unaware of the plan for [AP] to play out a sexual assault on [MP] at the [applicant's] home on 4 June"". A somewhat generous interpretation of something trial counsel said at the conclusion of the summing up is that the judge was asked to remind the jury of something he had said in his closing address on this issue (SU 152). The judge did allude to the subject (SU 147) and that, in my view, was sufficient to bring back to the jury's mind the argument that had been put to them by counsel. 

225Having regard to the circumstances of the trial which I set out earlier, I am not persuaded that there was any failure by the trial judge ""to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence"": Domican v The Queen, supra, at 561.

226I would refuse leave to rely upon this ground under rule 4 and, in relation to the final point, s 5(1)(b).

Ground 13: The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they should put out of their minds the evidence about the $50,000, the subject of the charge that was a not guilty verdict by direction

227Count 34 alleged that the three accused obtained $50,000 by a false pretence, namely ""by stating to [MP] and/or [GK] that the payment of $50,000 would obviate the need for [GK] to leave his family and become a monk"". The trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal in relation to this count on the basis that the alleged false statement was not as to a material existing fact but rather to a future event (judgment of 11 November 2010; AB 24 - 25).

228The written submissions for the appellant were brief:

1.11.1 Once the false pretences charge was the subject of an acquittal by direction, that evidence could only be used if it was relevant to the surviving counts. Her Honour was in error in treating the evidence as being also relevant to all of the remaining charges.

1.11.2 Alternatively, the trial judge failed to explain to the jury that, even assuming the [applicant] knew the real reason for being given the $50,000, that did not establish that she was involved in the sexual assault offences.

229The first observation to make about this ground is that there was no request made by trial counsel for the judge to do anything along the lines of what is now suggested. 

230The second matter is that it was trial counsel who agitated for the evidence relevant to the payment of the $50,000 to remain before the jury after judgment was given on 11 November 2010. Immediately after giving that judgment, her Honour invited the Crown Prosecutor to consider whether the exhibits relevant to count 34 should be withdrawn (T2071.33). After discussion of some other issues, Mr Evans returned to the subject:

EVANS: Your Honour It's a matter that you mentioned earlier as to the effect of the evidence that's been given in relation to count 34.

HER HONOUR: Yes.

EVANS: As a joint criminal purpose it is being put against my client and it maybe argued that the payment of $50,000 was in furtherance of that or as part of that to put it colloquially and that my client was in it for the money.

HER HONOUR: In what for the money?

EVANS: In the joint criminal purpose.

HER HONOUR: In respect of what?

EVANS: The sexual assaults and the other counts that are still on foot. In other words she was under some obligation having been paid $50,000 through her means, but I won't go into all the evidence, that she would be implicated. I would strongly oppose the removal of any exhibits or in anyway the evidence that has been given be reviewed and I'd want to call evidence as if that count was still there. Of course the difference is that the accused is no longer subject to conviction. But--

HER HONOUR: Well if there are exhibits that you don't - if you want all the exhibits to remain in then obviously they probably should be if you say that they go to issues that you rely on.

EVANS: Yes. I thought I should say that before your Honour directs the jury because you may wish to say something about the evidence that relates to that count and how they should view that.

HER HONOUR: Well what is it that you want me to say about it? I wasn't going to say anything at this stage. Perhaps we could defer that. At this stage all I was going to say was that in essence it was a matter of law that that was for me. There was in effect no evidence as to essential element and therefore that is why I was going to direct an acquittal on those counts. If you wish me to I could say at a later point I'll be telling me about the exhibits or the use that they can make of the exhibits in relation to other counts.

EVANS: Well perhaps as your Honour remarks the simplest thing is to leave the status quo.

HER HONOUR: Yes.

EVANS: If I seek to lead evidence my learned friend and Madam Crown can object and then it's an issue whether it's a--

HER HONOUR: Well the exhibits are strictly speaking evidence in the trial generally. They haven't been identified as relating to any particular account in any event.

EVANS: It's just that your Honour raised the possibility of returning some exhibits.

HER HONOUR: Yes. Well I just wanted counsel to think about that. Well then I'll just say nothing at this stage. Ms Crown you don't have a view about that one way or the other I assume?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour, no. (T2078 - 2079)

231Evidence was led from the applicant in chief about her receipt of the two sums of $25,000 from GK. The general tenor of her evidence was that she was a reluctant recipient. She said that she used the money to pay off a credit card, buy a computer and pay some bills. When she subsequently tried to reconcile what had happened to all of the money she could not account for $24,000 or $25,000 of it. She also gave evidence that the $24,000 paid on 2 June 2008 as the deposit on a house she and AP were purchasing came from a completely different source (T2809 - 2811; 2824 - 2833; 2883 - 2885). Bank statements were tendered to support the latter proposition (Exhibit 7). In cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor it was put, but denied, that the applicant was ""motivated to be involved in these offences because of $50,000 that [she] was going to get out of [her] involvement"" (T2985.42).

232In her closing address the Crown Prosecutor submitted that ""[FP] was involved in these things for the purpose of obtaining money, $50,000, to give her and [AP] the chance to get their own home"". In developing this point (T3131.19 - 3133.30) she suggested that the evidence supported the proposition that the applicant and her husband were in ""financial trouble"" with $10,000 owing on a credit card, various bills to pay, and wanting to buy their own home. Whether the $24,000 deposit for the home purchase came from money the applicant received from GK or from other funds was really a red herring.

233Counsel for the applicant countered the Crown's submissions on this topic by suggesting it was unlikely that she would want her husband to have sex with her sister-in-law for the sake of $50,000 (T3141.45). He was critical of the argument that the money was used to pay the deposit on a house and argued that the documentary evidence supported the applicant's assertion that she already had money set aside which was used for that purpose. He reminded the jury of the evidence that the applicant expressed reluctance in accepting the money from GK (T3155 - 3158).

234Counsel for AP sought to make use of the evidence concerning the $50,000 for the advantage of his client in that he contended that MP was motivated to falsely claim that she had been raped in order to get the money back (T3205.15). 

235Counsel for Golossian also sought to use this evidence to his client's advantage. He drew the jury's attention to a number of inconsistencies between the evidence of MP and GK. One of these was that the former had said that her husband did not explain why he had to pay the $50,000 or who he had to pay it to, whereas the latter said that he made up an explanation that it was an old gambling debt (T3264.35).

236There is no merit in this ground. No-one asked the trial judge to withdraw the evidence concerning the payment of the $50,000 after she had directed the acquittal on the false pretences count. To the contrary, counsel for the applicant positively wanted the evidence to remain. Counsel for each of the accused then sought to make use of it to the advantage of their respective clients. The argument now that the evidence was not relevant ignores the reality of the trial.

237The criticism of the trial judge for ""treating the evidence as being also relevant to all of the remaining charges"" was not explained and should be rejected. Similarly, the alternative criticism that her Honour failed to explain that even if the applicant knew the real reason for being given the $50,000 it did not follow that she was involved in the sexual assault offences should be rejected. Her Honour was not asked to. If there was a risk that the jury might leap from one conclusion to the other it may well be that something should have been said to warn against such reasoning. Clearly, however, none of the experienced counsel at trial had any such concern.

238Leave pursuant to r 4 should not be granted in respect of this ground.

Ground 14: The trial judge erred in permitting irrelevant and prejudicial cross-examination of the Appellant

239Various examples were cited in the applicant's written submissions but, having read the entirety of the cross-examination, I am unpersuaded that there is any merit in the contention that it was ""irrelevant and prejudicial"" (AWS 1.12). It is significant as well that counsel for the applicant at trial did not object to any of it on this basis. The trial judge, therefore, did not ""err by permitting"" it.

240It is now asserted that the cross-examination was ""long, irrelevant and prejudicial"" and that the prosecutor ""put as matters of fact a number of matters on which she could not have had positive instructions"". There was also criticism that the Crown Prosecutor had been ""aggressive"".

241The criticism as to the length of the cross-examination can readily be dismissed. It was only marginally longer in terms of the number of transcript pages than the evidence in chief. In terms of time, the evidence in chief commenced at approximately 12.30pm on 25 November 2010 and concluded just after lunch the following day (including an hour taken for a witness to be interposed). The cross-examination concluded before lunch the sitting day after that.

242It is unnecessary to deal with every example cited in the written submissions in the attempt to make good the submission of irrelevance and prejudice; the following selection will suffice.

243The first matter was that the cross-examination, in part, was on the subject of the $50,000 the applicant received from GK. It was submitted that this was not only irrelevant, but also that it was ""an endeavour to in some way trick her up and/or besmirch her honesty before the jury"" (AWS 1.12.3). Trial counsel obviously did not regard the subject as irrelevant. Not only did he actively seek to have the evidence relevant to the false pretences charge remain before the jury after the verdict by direction, he took considerable time in leading evidence in chief on the subject (T2790 - 2791; 2810 - 2811; 2824 - 2833; 2882 - 2885) and tendered some bank statements (Exhibit 7). Those circumstances alone justified the cross-examination which, in my view, was relevant, fair and not prejudicial. There is little wonder that the applicant's counsel did not object to it.

244A related complaint is that the Crown Prosecutor put to the applicant that she was ""motivated to be involved in the offences because of the $50,000 that [she] was going to get"" (T2985.42)(AWS 1.12.5). The submission now is that the Crown ""had no material to positively suggest that [the applicant] had any motive in taking part in the alleged offences to obtain money"". There was no attempt to explain that submission; in particular, why the Crown had to have ""material"" in order to put this suggestion to the applicant, or make the submission in closing address to the jury. It was a valid theory in my view and it is little wonder that trial counsel raised no objection.

245A similar complaint was that the Crown Prosecutor put to the applicant that she ""knew that Zolpidem was going to be used"" at the first prayer session (T2952.28) and that ""she knew a drug was being added to a substance that was being taken by [MP] with the intention of disabling [her]"" at each prayer session (T2985.30). The submission notes that these matters had been previously denied by the applicant (AWS 1.12.11-12). Whether the applicant had denied these matters in her evidence in chief, the fact remained that it was the Crown case that she did have such knowledge and there was circumstantial evidence supporting the propositions. It was incumbent upon the prosecutor to put to the applicant, in effect, that her earlier denials were contested given that the subject concerned a crucial element for the Crown to prove: Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67.

246I reject completely the submission that the Crown Prosecutor had been ""aggressive"". One would expect that if this was remotely true, complaint would have been raised at trial. Aggression certainly cannot be detected in the pages of the transcript. Indeed, the best that one can discern is that the cross-examination was conducted in a firm but restrained and professional manner.

247The lack of objection by trial counsel to any of the matters referred to in the applicant's written submissions serves to confirm my own impression of the Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination upon reading the transcript. There is no merit in any of the complaints now made. Leave to rely upon this ground should be refused.

Ground 15: The verdict of guilty was not reasonably open to the jury

248It was accepted on behalf of the applicant that some circumstantial evidence cases can be strong, but it was then submitted that this was not one of them in that ""there was always an explanation allowing a conclusion that the [applicant] was not involved"" (AWS 2.1.1). The written submissions then proceed to identify an individual circumstance by way of example and offer an innocent explanation for it. Examining individual circumstances and determining whether there is an alternative explanation available is not the correct approach: Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [466].

249Next it was submitted that there was a lack of evidence of the applicant knowing that MP had ingested Zolpidem. The Crown accepted that it could not definitively prove whether it was Golossian or the applicant who put the drug in the orange juice but the overwhelming inference was that the drug was in it and it must have been put there by either one of them. They each had the opportunity to do so. 

250On each of the three occasions, there was insistence by Golossian, in the applicant's presence, that MP drink all of the orange juice. A short time after she did, MP became ""dizzy"", ""lightheaded"", ""heavy"" and ""tired"". Her memory of events which followed was fragmented. On the journey home in the applicant's car after the first prayer session, when the effect of the drug was more than on the other occasions, she slept most of the way. Contrary to the applicant's submission (AWS 2.2.5) (which is an assertion without explanation) this account was consistent with the expert evidence of Dr Allender as to the effects of this particular drug. Further, the complainant gave evidence that she had difficulty walking and needed assistance. If that evidence were accepted, this symptom of ingesting a drug would have been obvious to the applicant. Indeed, it was necessary for her to assist MP into and out of the bathroom before and after the ""prayer sessions"".

251The next submission was that ""there was no satisfactory evidence to link the [applicant] with the co-accused"" (AWS 2.3). A number of points were raised but they were all matters available for the jury's consideration. I have taken them all into account in my assessment of the evidence but do not believe it is necessary to state a conclusion in relation to each and every point.

252In relation to the conspiracy charge (count 42) it was submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant had entered into any agreement, let alone participated in one, that her husband sexually assault MP at ""the test"". Moreover, it was submitted that there was evidence that she was in fact unaware of any such plan (AWS 2.4). I will say more about the conspiracy charge shortly.

253The written submissions for the applicant conclude with arguments about the closing address of the Crown Prosecutor, said to have ""included inaccurate and potentially misleading assertions"". These arguments are not relevant to the present ground.

Were the verdicts unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence?

254This ground requires the Court to make an independent assessment as to the sufficiency and quality of the evidence in accordance with the principles recently and succinctly set out in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, Fullerton and Garling JJ in Gilham v R, supra: 

[465] Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a verdict may be set aside if it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. As the High Court recently confirmed in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [14], when considering whether or not the verdict of a jury was unreasonable the appellate court is to make its own independent assessment of the evidence both as to sufficiency and quality. The question that an appeal court is required to determine is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"": M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493. Only in circumstances where a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal can be resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence can the court conclude that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: M at 494 quoted with approval in SKA at [13].

[466] The case against the applicant is a circumstantial one. As McClellan CJ at CL discussed in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [50]-[53], where a case is circumstantial ""the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused"": quoting Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ), citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen[1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252. However, a circumstantial case must be considered holistically. The court must weigh and consider the totality of the admissible evidence before reaching a conclusion, on the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of guilt or, in the alternative, that a doubt persists such that it would be dangerous to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ). Tortuous reasoning in order to explain away every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence should not be engaged in: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA).

255To that summary it is appropriate to add further reference to what was said in the majority judgment of French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [24]. Their Honours identified error in the approach taken by this Court when considering whether it had been satisfied ""that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the applicant"". They held that, ""it appears that this consideration was undertaken without any weighing of the competing evidence; an exercise which the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to undertake to determine whether the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable or could not be supported"".

256Upon my review of all of the evidence I have arrived at the conclusion that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt in respect of the s 38 and s 61J offences. 

257A starting point is to acknowledge that whilst the circumstances of the case are quite extraordinary, this is a feature that attended not only the prosecution case. The defence cases involved acceptance by each accused of unusual practices and beliefs. 

258Golossian said that he was deeply religious. He had a prayer room at his home and, although he was not a priest, he prayed upon people who sought his help. He described putting holy oil on a person's forehead and hands and praying from the Psalms. The problems these people came to him with included that they were ""jinxed"" or had ""the evil eye"". He believed that some people were able to place ""the evil eye"", a ""curse"", or ""black magic"" on other people. He would bless these people and give them a ""filacto"" which he said was a prayer written on a piece of paper which he would bless. He also spoke of being able to communicate with an angel. He could not see the angel; just a very strong light. If he wanted the angel to tell him where a curse was he would receive directions (T2087-2093).

259AP gave evidence that he had a deep belief in the ""evil eye"" and he believed in ""mayia or curses"". He believed that people can cause such things through envy or jealousy resulting in people suffering bad luck (T2326). He first encountered Golossian some 20 years earlier when he was experiencing a run of bad luck. Golossian told him that a curse had been put on him and he prayed and put oil on his hands and forehead. He was given a filacto which he has worn ever since (T2331 - 2332).

260The applicant also believed in black magic, the ""evil eye"" and objects called ""mayia"". Through her husband she received a filacto from Golossian which she has worn ever since (T2792 - 2799).

261Evidence by MP and GK of receiving calls and texts from ""the angel"" and ""the evil"", on its own might have been difficult to believe. However, it was amply supported by recordings which were before the jury (Exhibits B and C) and printouts of text messages. Moreover, AP gave evidence of being a source of some of these, although he endeavoured to provide an alternative explanation for them.

262For these reasons, the evidence of the complainant and her husband cannot be dismissed for reason of their beliefs in such unusual concepts and their accounts of bizarre events.

263I propose now to identify some of the primary circumstances which, in combination, satisfy me that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of counts 35 to 39 and 41.

264The evidence of the complainant included that she saw the applicant putting something in her bag after being in the vicinity of the complainant's clothes basket. She identified her pink underpants (confirmed in the evidence of Golossian (T2099)) in one of the mayias recovered by GK and AP and opened by Golossian. Such evidence supports the proposition that the applicant was a party at an early stage to a plan to deceive MP into thinking that she was afflicted by a curse. 

265That AP was also party to such a plan has support from the evidence of GK that AP, unannounced and unusually, was out the front of the complainant's home and acting suspiciously shortly before the first mayia was found. The high likelihood that he was the one who sent the text message that so upset MP and GK at the family barbecue on 2 February 2008 further supports that proposition. Two mobile phone SIM cards were shown to be associated with relevant calls and text messages (for example, from ""the angel"" and ""the evil""). There was a connection between AP and these SIM cards; when he was arrested he was found to have a phone in his pocket which contained one of these SIM cards and there was evidence that this phone had at an earlier time had the other SIM card in it. The text message on 2 February 2008 was sent from a phone with one of these SIM cards. Evidence that he was absent from the table when the text message was sent and reappeared a short time later adds weight to him being the sender, and thus to the proposition that he was an early participant in this elaborate scheme to frighten MP and GK.

266It was a virtually immediate response of the applicant when this text message was received to suggest that Tony Golossian be consulted by MP and GK. She counselled MP against going back to the priest who they had spoken to after finding of first mayia.

267On the way to the first prayer session, the applicant repeatedly told MP that it would be a dream, even though it would seem real. This was the same reassurance that Golossian offered to MP. The applicant's evidence was that she was merely repeating instructions that she had been given by GK. It was certainly the case that GK passed on instructions to the applicant as to what she was required to do in relation to prayer sessions. He said that he was simply relaying what he had been told by someone purporting to be an angel. However, he denied that this reassurance was something that he suggested to the applicant before the first prayer session (T722; 728). 

268The applicant herself had only ever had one prayer session, in Golossian's prayer room, and nothing had happened (ERISP 353 - 356). So, if she had not experienced a prayer session in which things felt real but were a dream, and if it is accepted that this form of reassurance did not come from GK, the applicant must have been acting in this respect at the behest of Golossian or, perhaps, her husband. This feature strongly supports the proposition that the applicant was aware of the plan to administer Zolpidem to MP for the purpose of enabling Golossian to perpetrate a sexual assault upon her.

269There was a powerful circumstantial case presented that Zolpidem was in fact administered to MP at each of the three prayer sessions. I have earlier summarised the factual elements of that case. Once the proposition is accepted, there are two conclusions available as to who was responsible; Golossian alone and without the applicant's knowledge, or either one of Golossian and the applicant but with the knowledge and concurrence of both. 

270MP's evidence was that in the first two prayer sessions, the applicant left the motel room to go and buy the juices but in relation to the third prayer session they were purchased on the way to the motel. The applicant's evidence was that the juices were purchased on the way to the motel on each occasion. If MP's evidence on this topic was accepted, the fact that the applicant purchased the orange juice and was absent from the room for a sufficient period for the drug to be dissolved in it to the point where it would be undetectable, supports the proposition that it was the applicant who laced the juice in the first two instances. The purchase on the way to the third prayer session suggests a greater possibility that it was Golossian who put the drug in the juice. In any event, it was unnecessary for the jury to determine beyond reasonable doubt whether it was Golossian or the applicant on any of the three occasions, simply that they were acting in combination. A finding beyond reasonable doubt that they were was well open, particularly having regard to them both reassuring MP that she would experience ""a dream"".

271The next highly relevant matter is that the applicant was present in the motel room during the course of each of the prayer sessions. The jury could well accept that she must have witnessed events including the drinking of the orange juice; the almost immediate effect of making MP unsteady on her feet (with the applicant helping her to and from the bathroom); and MP emerging from the bathroom naked, apart from a towel wrapped around her, and then laying on a bed in the presence of a man who proceeded to lay his hands on her. The applicant's claim that the decision to completely disrobe was MP's alone because she said she was concerned about getting oil on her clothes (T2817) defies belief.

272The applicant's claim to have gone to the bathroom was highly likely regarded by the jury as an attempt to find a convenient innocent, but false, explanation for her actions in the event that the jury accepted MP was sexually assaulted. For example, she said that GK had told her to go to the bathroom and recite the Lord's Prayer 15 times if she felt anything different (T2809). GK agreed that he had in fact told her that; he did so because of an instruction from the ""angels"" (T723). The applicant said she experienced the following during the first prayer session:

I felt a sharp pain on my left wrist, and I didn't think anything of it. And then I felt someone tugging at my hair from behind. When that happened I looked behind me, I had goosebumps because that was happening to me, and I remember [GK] said to me ""Whatever happens, if you feel anything, or you're not feeling right, go into the bathroom and pray 15 times"" (T2818).

273It was well open to the jury to accept that even if the applicant did go to the bathroom, she must have heard things of a sexual nature. For example, at the first prayer session, even if she was in the bathroom with the door closed, how could she not have heard MP crying and saying, ""Can you stop it hurts"" when she was being penetrated, or an ""evil"" voice saying, ""Pray you don't get pregnant""? In relation to the third prayer session, how could she not have been aware of a second man entering the room, having sex with the drugged complainant and then leaving? And, how did the second man know the right time to come to the room, that is, when the unwitting applicant would be in the bathroom? Why did the applicant not hear MP's sobbing when the second man was defiling her? In short, the applicant's denials of hearing such things were highly damaging to her credibility.

274I am satisfied that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that MP was sexually assaulted in the manner in which she claims on each of the three occasions of the prayer sessions. Insofar as one can glean from reading a transcript, her evidence was cogent and consistent. It was supported by the fact of her prompt complaints to her husband of having been sexually assaulted on each occasion. It was further supported by the detail of her complaint to HD. In relation to the latter, I do not think the fact that HD's account did not include MP saying that a penis was forced into her mouth at the second prayer session detracts from the cogency of this evidence, as there is so much in her account that is consistent with MP's evidence. The transposition of apple juice and orange juice in her account is too trivial to be of any concern.

275The applicant's evidence supported the proposition that MP had complained. Her evidence included that on the morning after the first prayer session, GK had called her and told her that MP was speaking of having been raped. It is hard to think of a sensible explanation for MP to have complained to her husband of being sexually assaulted when, according to the applicant, immediately after the prayer session the night before, MP had been ""saying how good she felt, the pains in her back weren't there, she felt fine"" and that compared to the way she was before the prayer session ""she was a lot happier, and she was smiling a lot"" (T2820). The applicant gave similar, and equally unacceptable, evidence about the other prayer sessions. She said that after the third prayer session, MP ""said the same thing as the other occasions about how good she felt after the prayer and you could see on her face a difference of happiness and smiling"" (T2870).

276Once it is accepted that MP was sexually assaulted, then the fact that the applicant was present on each occasion strongly supports the proposition that she was a party too it. The contrary is a most unlikely proposition because it is against logic and human experience that a man would perpetrate such assaults in the immediate presence of someone who is completely innocent and ignorant of what was in store.

277I do not regard the evidence that MP and GK had to beg Golossian to participate in prayer sessions and that the applicant expressed reluctance about being involved as detracting at all from the Crown case. The begging was undertaken on the instructions of the ""angel"" (T497). Golossian always insisted that the applicant be present during the prayer sessions and, moreover, she could have refused but the fact is she did not.

The conspiracy charge (Count 42)

278I am unable to conclude that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was a party to an agreement with Golossian and her husband, or at least one of them, that her husband would sexually assault MP on the occasion of ""the test"". There was no reasonable doubt that there was a plan to trick MP into having sexual intercourse with AP; the phone call from him that the police recorded in which she was given instructions about what she was to do with him (Exhibit C) amply established that proposition. Recordings that MP made herself lend further support (Exhibit B). But, whether this was a plan to which the applicant was a party was the subject of very little evidence.

279The most persuasive of what the Crown had was the evidence of something MP claimed that the applicant said at a gathering at the time a fourth prayer session was proposed. In her evidence in chief, MP said:

She [the applicant] turned around and said she had a dream that my father had died and that it was all my fault because I didn't do this prayer, this fourth prayer, and that I should get out of the church, you know, he stood up from the coffin and said 'get out, get out, it's all her fault' and Tony's response was that it was because I didn't do, if I am not going to do the prayer that is what will happen. (T172 - 173) (Emphasis added)

280When cross-examined about this, MP said:

[FP] said 'I had a dream'. My father had passed away and he was in his coffin at church, he got up out of the coffin and blamed me that he was dead because I didn't do the test. ... Tony responded, was saying it was a message from the angels saying that I must do the test. (T435 - 436) (Emphasis added)

281If the latter was to be accepted, it could support a finding that the applicant was both aware of the proposed ""test"" and wanted to encourage MP to participate in it. However, I have added emphasis in those passages to highlight the doubt that is created as to whether this statement by the applicant was a reference to one proposed event as opposed to another.

282It was common ground that the applicant was away from the home at the time the ""test"" was to occur, the plan being that AP and the complainant would be alone. The Crown relied upon a text message sent by the applicant which was said to indicate that she was aware she could not come home until after the complainant had left. In my view that evidence was somewhat equivocal, having regard to there also being a text message telling her husband that he should be available to pick up the children from school at a time when the ""test"" might still be occurring.

283Evidence that when the applicant ultimately went home, having not been told by her husband that it was safe to do so (because he had been arrested), she drove past the house and around the block, was said by the Crown to indicate she was aware of the police presence at the home. However, the fact is that after driving around the block she did go home.

284Other evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove this conspiracy was capable of inculpating AP and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Golossian. This evidence is listed in the written submissions of the Crown Prosecutor on the no case issue, a copy of which is annexed to the Crown written submissions. However, it is unnecessary to express a concluded view about that. The point is, such evidence dis not inculpate the applicant. 

285The preceding events establishing that the applicant was a party to what went on at the prayer sessions may have obscured the need to isolate and identify the evidence concerning the applicant in respect of this conspiracy. When that task is undertaken, it becomes clear in my view that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to be satisfied of her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Orders

286I propose the following orders in respect of the application for leave to appeal against conviction:

1. Leave to appeal in respect of grounds 1 to 14 refused.

2. Leave to appeal in respect of ground 15 granted.

3. The appellant's conviction for the offence of conspiracy (count 42) quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.

4. The appeal otherwise dismissed.

Application for leave to appeal against sentence

287As indicated at the outset, an aggregate sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years was imposed which was specified to commence on 29 April 2011. Accordingly, the applicant will become eligible for release on parole 28 April 2016.

288A requirement of imposing an aggregate sentence is that a judge is to specify the individual sentences that would have been imposed and, where a standard non-parole period is prescribed, the non-parole period as well: ss 53A and 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The following were specified:


Counts 35, 37 and 39 (the s 38 offences): imprisonment for 4 years. 
Count 36 and 41 (s 61J): 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. 
Count 38 (s 61J): 5 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
Count 42 (Conspiracy): 2 years.

289The sentence was imposed on 6 May 2011. The commencement date of 29 April 2011 was to give credit for 7 days presentence custody.

Remarks on sentence

290After reciting the facts of the various offences the judge described the offences concerning MP as involving ""a deliberate and calculated plan to take advantage of her vulnerable state at that time of her life"". Advantage was taken of her cultural beliefs and her trust in members of her own family by marriage. The fact that MP's father was gravely ill at the time was well known to the applicant and her husband.

291Her Honour found that Golossian and AP devised and instigated the plan in relation to MP, just as they had done relation to MM. The applicant was found to have played a lesser role; her Honour also finding that she was drawn into the scheme by virtue of her marriage to AP.

292There was a victim impact statement before the court. It was described as revealing ""emotional devastation"" caused by the conduct of the three offenders. Her Honour found that substantial harm was caused: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 21A(2)(g). 

293Matters personal to the applicant that were taken into account included that she was 38 years of age and had no previous convictions. Reference was made to a psychological report in which it was indicated that the applicant had been transferred to the psychiatric section of the prison due to ""mental decompensation"" and placed on a strong regime of psychotropic medication. I interpolate that the applicant was only in prison for 7 days before she was admitted to bail. 

294The judge referred to the applicant having suffered an extreme psychological reaction and symptoms of post-traumatic stress following the revelation to the police by her brother of his conduct towards her as a child. She had previously managed to block these episodes out. The applicant was also experiencing an anxiety disorder.

295The applicant had concerns for the future welfare of her children who, at the time of sentencing, were aged 8, 13 and 15. The children had been assessed and a psychological report in respect of them indicated that they would each be severely affected by their mother's incarceration; particularly given their father would be in the same situation. The judge noted that the children were living with their grandmother who had been affected by the legal proceedings as well. She was not in good physical health and there had been an exacerbation of pre-existing mental health problems. Her Honour stated that she had taken these factors into account to the extent she was able.

296Her Honour found that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. Special circumstances were found on the basis that she would benefit from a longer period of supervision than that provided by the statutory ratio (see however Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008, cl 228(1) which limits supervision in such a case to a period of up to 3 years).

297The judge made findings as to where in the range of objective seriousness the sexual assault offences committed by Golossian and AP lay. When she came to the applicant, however, she did not make any such findings. She did, however, enunciate her reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period: prior good character; lesser role; first time in custody; and having committed the offences under the influence of her husband and Golossian.

298After referring to the number of offences for which each offender stood for sentence, her Honour said that they all were ""very serious"".

Grounds of appeal

299Three grounds of appeal were originally notified and a fourth was added by leave (it was numbered ""2A"" for some reason but I will refer to it as ""4""):

1. The sentence was unduly harsh and severe.

2. The objective circumstances did not warrant the sentence.

3. The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account or sufficiently take into account the subjective features of the Appellant.

4. The sentencing judge erred in her approach to the application of the legislation setting standard non-parole periods.

Submissions

300In relation to ground 2 it was submitted that the sentence was not warranted when regard was had to six matters:

i. No motive was established against the applicant.

ii. The applicant was not involved in any planning but simply joined in, either because of pressure and bullying by GK or some misguided belief in Golossian.

iii. The applicant was not in a position of trust.

iv. The applicant did not injure, abuse or degrade the complainant.

v. The applicant played no part in the frightening or intimidating telephone calls.

vi. The applicant received no reward for what she did.

301It was not contended that there was error on the part of the judge in respect of any of these matters. As to the first matter, the judge specifically stated that she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about what motivated the applicant. 

302As to the second matter, the submission ignores evidence such as the applicant taking the complainant's underpants in order that they could be used to make her think she was the subject of a curse. 

303The third matter is not entirely correct in that the judge found, appropriately, that advantage was taken of, inter alia, the complainant's trust in members of her own family by marriage. It was also said in the victim impact statement that she placed ""unconditional trust"" in the applicant and the applicant's husband. The applicant's role in tricking the complainant into believing that she was cursed and would have to go to extreme lengths to break it was not insignificant.

304There can be no argument about the final three matters but, if they had been present, they would amount to aggravating features. An absence of aggravating features does not mean an offence is less serious. The submission simply points out that the offences could have been worse.

305Ultimately, there is no point in determining this ground as the submissions in support of it simply refer to a limited selection of what were, or were not, present amongst the multitude of issues that were relevant to the assessment of sentence. Whether the sentence was unduly excessive remains to be considered under ground 1.

306In support of the third ground it was submitted that the sentencing judge failed to (sufficiently) take into account certain subjective features that should have pointed to leniency and the following matters were identified:

i. Prior good character.

ii. The applicant was a good and loving mother.

iii. There was insufficient recognition or allowance for destruction of the family structure. Further, the applicant's sentence would be harsher because of her ongoing cares and concerns about her children. A finding of exceptional circumstances was ""justified"".

iv. The applicant had already suffered significant imposition of restricted freedom in that she had ""onerous bail conditions"" for over two and a half years.

307The judge specifically stated that she took into account the applicant's prior good character and so there is no merit in the first contention. 

308The second point is more relevant to the next as on its own it is either irrelevant, or of very marginal significance given the finding of good character.

309The limitation on the extent to which hardship to third parties may be taken into account is the subject of well settled principles: see, for example, R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 515. There is no suggestion that the very experienced sentencing judge was unaware or overlooked such principles. Indeed there is an indication that she had them well in mind when, after she referred to the evidence relevant to this topic, she said, ""I have taken all these factors into account to the extent that I am able"" (R/S 25). 

310In her reference to the reports that were before her in relation to this issue her Honour also specifically adverted to the applicant's ""concerns for the future welfare of her children"". I am satisfied that she was sufficiently cognisant of the hardship to the applicant's children and their carer as well as the anguish the applicant would experience as a result. Clearly, her Honour gave careful consideration to this issue. In the end, it was a matter for her discretion to determine the extent to which the sentence should be ameliorated on account of these matters. Error would need to be demonstrated on House v The King principles before this Court could intervene: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. It was submitted that a finding of exceptional circumstances was ""justified"". That is not the same as saying that the finding should have been made if the discretion was correctly exercised. In my view, no error has been shown.

311The final matter concerns the applicant being on ""onerous bail conditions"", it being submitted that the judge failed to take into account ""the lengthy period, over 2½ years that the Appellant had been reporting between 3 and 5 times per week to police"". The true position according to the Crown's submissions was that she was reporting five times per week for six weeks and then three times per week for the ensuing 2 years 2 months until the commencement of the trial. Resolution of this contention does not require determination of that dispute.

312In R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; (2003) 151 A Crim R 166, the Court (Tobias JA, James and Howie JJ) considered the issue of whether onerous bail conditions should be taken into account and said:

[242] We accept that in an appropriate case the length and terms of an offender's period on bail awaiting trial or sentence is a matter relevant to the determination of the proper sentence to be imposed. What weight is to be given to such a matter will vary from case to case, depending upon what other factors need to be considered and what sentence is required in the particular case to address the purpose of punishment. Where that purpose is the protection of the community and the conditions of bail are particularly onerous, such as where the offender has been required to reside at a rehabilitation establishment, very significant weight might be placed upon such a factor where it is appropriate having regard to the nature of the offence. However, in other cases, less weight may be given to such a consideration, particularly where the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is required for the purposes of denouncing the crime and reflecting general deterrence.

313A submission was made to her Honour that she should take this matter into account (1.4.11 at T6.35) but there was no mention of it in the sentencing remarks. I do not believe that there was any error. The applicant lived at Enfield and was required to report to a police station that was not a significant distance from her home at Burwood, probably less than three kilometres. I take the same approach as that taken by Grove J in R v Webb [2004] NSWCCA 330; (2004) 149 A Crim R 167:

[18] ... It is undoubtedly open to a sentencing judge to take into account onerous conditions of bail in assessing sentence but he [or she] is not obliged so to do. The circumstances in which the applicant was on bail in this case do not mandate any such mitigation of sentence ... .

314The new ground of appeal against sentence, which I have numbered four, involves a contention that the sentencing judge's approach to the standard non-parole period for the sexual assault offences was contrary to the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The sentencing exercise in the present case occurred before the courts of this State had the benefit of Muldrock, when judges and practitioners understood that the longstanding authority of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, in respect of which the High Court had refused to grant special leave to appeal, prescribed the correct approach.

315The written submissions for the applicant included that her Honour erred in:

i. apparently incorrectly construing that the application of the non-parole period legislation mandated a particular non-parole period for a particular offence;

ii. apparently treating the non-parole period as if it were the necessary starting point or the only important end-point in framing a sentence;

iii. apparently giving determinative or even primary significance to the prescribed period when it was only one of a large number of matters to be taken into account; and

iv. commencing with a non-parole period as prescribed under the legislation which she would have imposed as the non-parole period, but for the existence/application of the matters set out therein.

316The use of the word ""apparently"" in respect of the first three contentions may be taken as a concession that it is not at all clear that the contention is correct. In any event, none of these submissions are borne out by what her Honour actually said. I have summarised the sentencing remarks above. They have all the hallmarks of her Honour taking all relevant matters into account, including the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as guideposts, in the manner required by Muldrock. 

317The fact that the judge gave reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period was consistent with what was required by R v Way and is not inconsistent with what was said in Muldrock. The joint judgment in the latter includes:

[29] A central purpose of Div 1A is to require sentencing judges to state fully the reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. The reference in s 54B(4) to ""mak[ing] a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period"" is not to be understood as suggesting either the need to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period, or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending. It does require the judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The obligation applies in sentencing for all Div 1A offences regardless of whether the offender has been convicted after trial or whether the offence might be characterised as falling in the low, middle or high range of objective seriousness for such offences. 

318I do not accept that there was anything erroneous in her Honour's approach in relation to the standard non-parole period for the aggravated sexual assault offences. She did not purport to ""attribute mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period"". She did not, in the case of the applicant, ""classify the objective seriousness of the offending"", although indicating how serious a judge regards an offence is basic sentencing practice: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [46] per Johnson J. She did identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which bore upon her judgment as to the appropriate sentence to impose. She did not commence with the question of whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period (Muldrock at [25]) or adopt a ""two-stage approach"" (Muldrock at [27]).

319Her Honour's approach in this case may be contrasted with that which was found recently to be erroneous in Mendes v R [2012] NSWCCA 103. In that case her Honour first stated the question whether she should impose the standard non-parole period; said that she found that the offence in question fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness; and then gave reasons for not imposing the standard. In the present case, her Honour did not commence with the question of whether the standard should be imposed and then make a finding as to where in the range of objective seriousness the offence fell. 

320There is nothing in what her Honour said that justifies the submission that she ""impermissibly limited the full exercise of her discretion"" (Further AWS at (d)).

321I would reject this ground.

322That leaves the first ground to be considered. Nothing was put in the written submissions for the applicant that was specifically devoted to it. There was no attempt to engage with the basic propositions set out in the respondent's submissions.

323To make good this ground it is necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. This Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised her discretion: Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. Intervention by this Court on a ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive is not warranted simply because the sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 538 [59].

324Mr Ramage said in the course of his oral submissions:

I concede at first blush the sentences were not dramatically high. On the other hand, this was a case where she was sentencing a mother of three children who had no prior convictions whatsoever and led a blameless life until then. (31.1.12 at T36.27)

325Is an aggregate sentence of 9 years ""plainly unjust"" for a person who played a significant role in facilitating the unlawful drugging and sexual penetration of a woman on three separate occasions? The circumstances attending the offences were certainly unusual but that did not diminish their seriousness. Of the purposes of sentencing listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, general deterrence, punishment, denunciation and making the applicant accountable for her actions were significant in the applicant's case. There is, on the other hand, every reason to be sympathetic to the plight of the applicant's children and her anxiety in being separated from them. There are, however, limitations on the significance of those features. Leniency was warranted on account of the applicant's prior good character, lack of previous convictions and unlikelihood of reoffending.

326Giving full force to all matters favourable to the applicant, I am left in the position of being unpersuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

327A question remains whether there should be some downward adjustment of the aggregate sentence to give effect to my conclusion that the conviction for the conspiracy offence was not supported by the evidence and should be quashed. One of the difficulties with aggregate sentencing is that this Court does not know what the sentencing judge would have regarded as appropriate to reflect the totality of criminality if the convictions were confined to the s 38 and s 61J offences. The only indication of her view of the seriousness of that offence is that she said she would have imposed an individual sentence of 2 years. When that is compared to the indicative sentences of 4 years, 5 years 4 months and 6 years for the other offences, it would seem that the conspiracy was regarded as significantly less serious.

328There was a suggestion during the course of oral submissions that, if a question arose as to resentence following this Court quashing any conviction, the matter should be remitted to the District Court (1.2.12 at T5). Given that what I propose is the quashing of only the conspiracy count, and not one or more of the more serious counts, it is my view that this Court should make its own assessment on resentence. 

329The conspiracy made some contribution to the totality of criminality. There should be a reduction of the aggregate sentence to reflect this but it should not be great. I propose a period of 6 months with a proportional reduction of the non-parole period.

Orders

330I reiterate that I propose the following orders in respect of the application for leave to appeal against conviction:

1. Leave to appeal in respect of grounds 1 to 14 refused.

2. Leave to appeal in respect of ground 15 granted.

3. The appellant's conviction for the offence of conspiracy (count 42) quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.

4. The appeal otherwise dismissed.

331I propose the following orders in respect of the application for leave to appeal against sentence:

1. Leave to appeal against sentence allowed.

2. Aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with non-parole period of 5 years quashed.

3. In lieu, sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 8 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 8 months to date from 29 April 2011. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 28 December 2015.

4. Pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the sentences that would have been imposed for each of the offences against ss 38 and 61J Crimes Act 1900 had separate sentences been imposed are the same as indicated by the District Court.

332SCHMIDT J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2759922,Enders v Erbas & Associates Pty Ltd [2012] NSWDC 129,"Judgment

1These are reasons for rulings I have given earlier today granting leave to the defendants to file a Further Amended Defence to the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim and in relation to the defendants' application to strike out particulars of the Reply.

2The defendants by notice of motion, initially returnable 31 August 2012 but heard by agreement between the parties today, sought orders as follows:

(1)Pursuant to s 64 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the first and second defendants have leave to file their defence to the second further amended statement of claim in the form of Annexure 'A' to this Motion.

(2)That the following paragraphs of the plaintiff's Reply be struck out pursuant to r 14.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW):

(a)Paragraph 2(ii)(c);

(b)Paragraph 2(ii)(d);

(c)Paragraph 2(ii)(f);

(d)Paragraph 2(ii)(g).

(3)Such further or other orders as the court thinks fit.

(4)The plaintiff pay the first and second defendants' costs of this application.

3The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation on 1 July 2011, for a publication asserted to have been made by the defendants on 5 July 2010. The text of the matter complained of consists of an email sent by the second defendant to the employees of the first defendant. That email, which attached a work calendar for the period commencing 31 May 2010 to 11 July 2010, stated:

""To All,

In one month, I quickly counted 24 sick days, 21 late comers and 26 days of holiday as attached. This is equivalent of 3 people not here continuously throughout the month. This also means that the rest of the people here will be doing their jobs so that we can produce adequate to pay everyone's salary.

This is not fair to the company and the ones who come on time every time. We will be looking at this very seriously in the next days. It costs us big dollars per day of productivity. This is not acceptable.

Today only, 5 people sick and 1 on holidays. It hurts management to run the projects.

We will talk about this at our first staff meeting.""

4The plaintiff is identified by her first name in the attached work calendar.

5The imputations pleaded by the plaintiff, in their current form, are:

(a)The plaintiff is a malingerer.

(b)The plaintiff unjustifiably took time off by falsely pretending she was sick.

(c)The plaintiff does not act fairly to her employer.

(d)By unjustifiably taking time off work the plaintiff does not act fairly to other staff.

(e)[Imputation deleted]

(f)The plaintiff hurts management in the running of projects by unjustifiably absenting herself from work.

6Before setting out reasons for my rulings, I shall first outline the procedural history of this defamation action and the circumstances in which the defendants first pleaded, then abandoned, then sought to replead particulars of qualified privilege which included the particulars for which leave to amend is now sought.

Procedural history

7After the first return date, the matter was listed on 23 September 2011 for a hearing of an application by the defendants to have the proceedings struck out. On 23 September 2011, the following orders were made in the Defamation List:

(1)Plaintiff is to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim within seven days.

(2)Defendant is to file an Amended Defence to the Further Amended Statement of Claim within 21 days thereafter.

(3)Listed for further directions in the Defamation List on 4 November 2011.

(4)Each party to pay its own costs of the application today.

8The parties were unable to tell me today whether these orders were made as a result of a hearing of objections to the form of the pleadings, and whether there was any capacity argument. Counsel for the defendant told me that the defendant has new legal representation, and counsel for the plaintiff did not appear on the occasion in question. Mr McHugh said that the previous counsel's submissions stated that the court ordered the plaintiff to serve an amended pleading identifying the matters relied upon in support of the contention that there had been ""bilateral publication in this jurisdiction of the matter complained of"" (written submissions of the defendants, 7 October 2011, paragraph 1). 

9An Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 30 September 2011. The matter was relisted on 7 October 2011 so that further objections could be dealt with in relation to the pleadings including the pleading of republication. Given the deletion of imputation (e) from the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim (see paragraph 5 above) it is possible a ruling on capacity occurred either on 23 September, or 7 October, or both. Counsel then appearing for the defendants provided the court with the written submissions referred to above, outlining asserted pleading errors of the plaintiff. There is no judgment, but the orders made were as follows:

(1)Plaintiff to file a Further Statement of Claim addressing such matters as the plaintiff sees fit within 7 days.
(2)Vacate the directions made on 23 September 2011 and replace those directions with the following:
(a)The defendant is to file and serve an Amended Defence by 4 November 2011.
(b)The plaintiff is to file and serve any Reply by 9 November 2011.
(c)Listed for further directions in the Defamation List on 11 November 2011.
(3)Costs reserved.

10These proceedings were next before the court on 11 November 2011. The defendants filed a Defence and a timetable was entered into for service of a Reply and discovery. The defendant had pleaded reliance upon profitability interest as one of the bases for a qualified privilege defence at common law and pursuant to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). The discovery issue was stood over to 17 February for argument. On 17 February costs were reserved and the matter stood over to 24 February 2012. Although there is no judgment or formal order, the plaintiff must have successfully argued that documents be discovered on this issue, given the inclusion of an award of costs of ""the argument on 24.2.12"" in the orders made by the list judge on 27 April.

11The categories of documents for discovery by the defendants included, relevantly:

""...

(10) Plaintiff's employment files and records.

(11) Income tax returns, balance sheets, and profit and loss accounts of the defendant from 1 July 2008 to date.""

12However, on 3 April 2012, the solicitors then acting for the defendants, wrote to the plaintiff stating:

""Our clients propose no longer to rely upon any profitability interest as a basis for their defence of qualified privilege.

We note that the Court's order on 24 February 2012 that our clients give discovery of income tax returns and profit and loss accounts of the first defendant from 1 July 2008 to date (the ""profitability documents"") was made solely on the basis that such documents were relevant to our clients' defence of qualified privilege based on the profitability interest.

As our clients propose no longer to rely upon that element of their defence of qualified privilege, the profitability documents no longer have any relevance to the issue that are in dispute in these proceedings.

Accordingly, our clients propose to apply to the Court for an order varying the 24 February 2012 discovery orders, so as no longer to required [sic] discovery of the profitability documents.

Please confirm that, when the matter is next before the Court, your client will consent to the filing of the enclosed amended defence, and that, in the interim, your client does not press discovery of the profitability documents.

If we do not receive such confirmation within 7 days, we will apply to have the matter restored to the list for the purpose of immediately determining the applications foreshadowed herein.""

13The defendants were granted leave to file this amended defence on 27 April, subject to payment of costs thrown away and ""costs of the argument"" on 24 April 2012. The parties handed up short minutes relating to the administration of interrogatories and on the next return date (1 June 2012) a hearing date for a jury trial of 4 - 5 days was allocated. In fact neither side had sought a jury trial and, when the matter was listed before me on 8 June 2012 for pre-trial management, the parties requested that this order be amended accordingly.

14At the pre-trial directions hearing before me on 8 June, the parties were asked to identify any outstanding issues. The defendants have sought leave to amend the defence to reinstate the previously deleted particular. These are the matters for determination today. The plaintiff opposes leave to amend being granted, or alternatively seeks discovery of documents going beyond those sought in February, namely documents going back to 2006, and documents in addition to tax returns and profit and loss documents. The defendants have also raised objections to the form of the Reply.

The defendants' application for leave to amend the particulars of the defence

15These proceedings are fixed for hearing on 22 October 2012 for hearing. As a general rule, all interlocutory steps should have been attended to by parties seeking rulings, as part of case management in the Defamation List. The parties sought rulings on one or more occasions, and it was following one of these occasions that the defendants abandoned reliance upon the particulars which they now propose to reinstate.

16In Lee v Keddie [2011] NSWCA 2, an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of the Defamation List Judge to allow certain amendments was dismissed. There are factual similarities with the present case; both were set down for hearing at the time of the application, both were claims arising from publications by a plaintiff and defendant in an employer/employee relationship, and in both cases a defence of qualified privilege was pleaded. In Lee v Keddie the particulars the subject of the application for leave were allegations that the defendants, prior to publication of the matter complained of, asked the plaintiffs to behave dishonestly in order to help the defendants meet complaints by the firm's clients about their conduct as solicitors (at [3]). It was common ground that if these amendments were permitted, the hearing date would have to be vacated. 

17Although Ms Evans submitted that an adjournment of the hearing was possible if this claim was particularised, it is unlikely that the provision of the financial information to support the proposed particulars would trigger an adjournment or even extend the time for the trial. By contrast, in Lee v Keddie, a previous trial date had already been vacated for unrelated reasons (problems with the representation of the plaintiffs) and a second adjournment of the trial was considered particularly undesirable.

18Allsop P stated at [7]:

""[7] The reasons of the primary judge for refusing leave were, in my view, compelling. A three week hearing date would have been vacated having already been vacated in August last year. The matters the subject of the paragraphs in question contain allegations of the utmost seriousness. They had not been part of any pleaded case although, interlocutory steps of discovery had been sought for material which would have underpinned them. Those requests were some time ago abandoned.""

19Allsop P went on to note at [11]:

""Justice is justice to both sides and relevant is the timely and appropriate administration of justice. Matters of the most serious kind have been raised in a relevant sense four years after the defamation and three years after the case began. Matters which go to the heart of the question of malice which was always at the forefront of the plaintiffs' case in reply was pleaded from the outset, that is, malice was pleaded from the outset. The subject matter is a matter that was always to the knowledge and within the knowledge of the plaintiffs. No aspect of language could have affected their understanding of what they say had been said to them by the defendants.""

20Another case where a very late application for leave to amend was also refused was Sharma v Shandil [2011] NSWCA 155. The defendant had abandoned the defence of qualified privilege in its entirety at the trial, but then sought to reinstate the defence two weeks after the evidence had closed. The court noted that it had been open to the defendant to seek to reopen the case at the time, and that the defendant had not done so. This is suggestive of a more flexible view to late amendment than that taken in Lee v Keddie.

21Allsop P in Lee v Keddie at [10] referred to AON Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175 (""AON""). Counsel for the plaintiff has also relied upon this decision in the application before me. Ms Evans first drew my attention to the lack of explanation for the proposed amendment.

22In AON, the High Court noted the importance of an explanation of the reasons for late amendment. The explanation here seems to be that the position was reconsidered after the defendants retained new solicitors and new counsel. This was, I note, the explanation offered (and rejected) in Lee v Keddie, and it is not an explanation that would, by itself, be considered sufficient.

23In oral submissions, Mr McHugh stated that there had been problems with the conduct of the proceedings, and that the informal way the matter had been conducted in the Defamation List had been a problem for both parties. He drew my attention to his instructing solicitors' letter of 12 August 2012 referring being ""in the dark"" because of ""a dearth of particulars and even interrogatories"" on both sides, and suggesting agreement between the parties to overcome these difficulties (Exhibit E to the affidavit of Stephanie Borg).

24While the Court of Appeal has warned that rulings on imputations in the Supreme Court should be the subject of not only orders but reasons for decision (Ahmed v John Fairfax Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 6 at [102]), this expectation does not necessarily apply to inferior courts, particularly where the scope of the claim is modest: Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 at [42] - [43]. Decisions of the District Court are of interest to the parties, but of no precedent value (Bristow v Adams at [7]). The matter complained of in Bristow v Adams was, similarly, a publication of limited extent arising out of disputes in the workplace, circulated to fellow employees, so these observations by the Court are of particular relevance here.

25As to the claim that the orders do not reflect rulings, the degree to which the parties should require orders reflecting decisions on case management issues is a matter for the parties. The defendants were content to go along with an informal procedure of dealing with disputes about pleading and legal issues, and should not be entitled to complain about it now. 

26However, the proposed amendments do not represent a significant change of position, as was the case in AON. In the present case, the amendment sought is to reinstate particulars already provided, and to provide discovery along the lines of what had previously been agreed. The subject matter is an issue of relevance, given the content of the matter complained of. The interests of justice favour permitting the amendment, provided that adequate discovery is given, and there is time for interrogatories to be administered. This brings me to Ms Evans' second argument.

27The second matter raised by Ms Evans was that that the delay to discovery and interrogatories is of significance and could result in an adjournment of the trial date. The parties entered into a consent timetable on 27 April 2012 concerning discovery and interrogatories which has not been adhered to. A strict timetable should resolve this problem, and this has been included in the orders that I have made.

28Ms Evans' third basis for objection to the grant of leave to amend was made on the basis that the qualified privilege defence, particularly the s 30 defence, was hopeless. She drew my attention to s 30(3)(h), namely the failure of the defendants to provide the substance of the plaintiff's side of the story, or to have made a reasonable attempt to do so.

29I do not accept this submission. A summary finding would be made as to the availability of a defence of qualified privilege only in exceptional circumstances: Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wiese (1990) 4 WAR 263; (1990) A Def R 50-095; S, DJ v Channel Seven Adelaide Pty Ltd [2008] SASC 108; Walker v Veda Advantage Information Services & Solutions Ltd [2011] QSC 316. In response to the submission that the plaintiff was not given an opportunity to reply (s 30 (h)) and include that response in the publication, the s 30 defence succeeded in LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah [2011] NSWCA 370 at [138], where no opportunity to reply (other than a simple denial by one plaintiff) was given when allegations of attempting to steal from a shop were made.

30Ms Evans submitted that, if leave were granted, the defendant should provide more documents than had been the subject of agreement when the orders of 24 February 2012 were made. She sought documents going back to 2006, when the plaintiff was first employed. The defendants have offered to provide documents evidencing the work being performed by the staff of the first defendant and its due dates at the relevant times, but submit that to discover documents going back to 2006 would be excessive.

31I have accepted the defendants' argument, for two reasons. Firstly, the 2008 date was that originally determined by the parties in February 2012 as the appropriate cut-off date. Secondly, the issue of discovery may have been dealt with during the informal argument in the defamation list which resulted in case management orders and, if so, I would be reluctant to go behind any such determination.

32The defendants have accordingly been granted leave to amend, conditional upon production of the documents the parties previously agreed should be discovered.

The defendants' application to strike out particulars contained in the Reply

33The defendants seek orders striking out particulars 2(ii)(c), (d), (f) and (g). These particulars are as follows:

(c) Defendants' failure to admit publishing the matter complained of.

(d) Defendants' conduct in terminating the plaintiff's employment by way of redundancy when she had recovered from her illness sufficiently so as to be able to work.

(f) Wrongful failure of the defendants to apologise.

(g) Defendants' conduct in defending the matter complained of by alleging that the profitability of the defendants' business justified publication of the matter complained of about the plaintiff.

34The objections fall into two main categories:

(a)Particulars relating to the conduct of the litigation by the defendants (particulars 2(ii)(c), (f) and (g)); and

(b)The inclusion of a claim of post publication conduct asserted to evidence improper motive which may result in the trial being a ""mini-trial"" as to the defendants' motive for terminating the plaintiff's employment (particular 2(ii)(d)).

35I shall deal with the objections to particulars 2(ii)(c), (f) and (g) first. 

The conduct of litigation by the defendants, including the conduct of the trial

36As Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law & Practice at [18,040] point out, conduct on the part of the defendant subsequent to the publication of the defamatory material, including the manner in which the trial is conducted, may be relied upon in relation to malice, although the court is wary at drawing inferences of improper motive from legitimate conduct such as defending the proceedings. That the inference is open is, however, clear from the remarks made by Jordan CJ in Guise v Kouvelis (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 419 at 422-423, where cross-examination of the plaintiff by counsel was regarded as capable of reinforcing inference that the defendant was animated by ill will towards the plaintiff, an ill will which continued and received a new manifestation at the trial.

37As the manner of conduct of proceedings is a recognised basis upon which improper motive may be pleaded, I am reluctant to strike out these particulars. Whether or not improper motive may be established will be a matter for the trial. Accordingly, particulars 2(ii)(c) and (g) will not be struck out.

38However, particular 2(ii)(f) (""Wrongful failure of the defendants to apologise"") is a hopeless particular, for the reasons explained by Levine J in Harrigan v Jones [2000] NSWSC 814 at [42]-[43]:

""[42] Particular (i): ""Wrongful failure to retract and apologise"". Here we are not concerned with any failure to apologise. Here we are not concerned with any failure to apologise being available as a component for ordinary compensatory damages (Clarke v Ainsworth (1996) 40 NSWLR 463). Nor are we concerned with a failure to apologise being improper, unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides in support of a claim for aggravated damages. What is here asserted is that Mr Jones was actuated by express malice by reason of what is said to have been a wrongful failure to retract and apologise for that publication actuated by that state of mind. These are the matters to which proper particulars should be directed if the plaintiff, in the end, proposes to assert express malice on the part of Mr Jones by reason of this failure to apologise. This the plaintiff has clearly failed to do. In Waterhouse/2GB at 68F Hunt J dealt with similar allegations on the question of absence of good faith but in the context of the protected report defence. His Honour's general observations there are apposite.

[43] This is a hopeless particular and without more cannot be said to point in a substantive way to the availability of what is asserted as a matter going to malice in any event.""

39Particular 2(ii)(f) will be struck out. While I have granted leave to the plaintiff to provide further particulars for the Reply, these particulars should not include a revised form of 2(ii)(f), or particulars similar to those struck out by Levine J in Harrigan v Jones.

The inclusion of a claim of post publication conduct (particular 2(ii)(d))

40The objection to particular 2(ii)(d) is that it may result in the hearing becoming a ""mini-trial"" as to the defendants' motive for terminating the plaintiff's employment by redundancy despite her recovery from cancer.

41Conduct on the part of a defendant at any stage up to and including the trial may be relied upon as evidence of malice. The circumstances of termination of the plaintiff's employment clearly falls within that category. Whether or not this issue dominates the trial can be dealt with by appropriate trial rulings.

Other issues

42In paragraph 8 of the defence, the defendants plead that any damages awarded to the plaintiff should be reduced ""or further and alternatively set-off under s 21 Civil Procedure Act"" by reason of the plaintiff's delay in complaining of the alleged republication and by failing to complain of the publication or seek redress prior to instituting these proceedings and/or filing in these proceedings a Further Amended Statement of Claim.

43Section 21 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides:

""21 Defendant's right to set-off 

(1) If there are mutual debts between a plaintiff and a defendant in any proceedings, the defendant may, by way of defence, set off against the plaintiff's claim any debt that is owed by the plaintiff to the defendant and that was due and payable at the time the defence of set-off was filed, whether or not the mutual debts are different in nature. 

(2) This section extends to civil proceedings in which one or more of the mutual debts is owed by or to a deceased person who is represented by a legal personal representative. 

(3) This section does not apply to the extent to which the plaintiff and defendant have agreed that debts (whether generally or as to specific debts) may not be set off against each other. 

(4) This section does not affect any other rights or obligations of a debtor or creditor in respect of mutual debts, whether arising in equity or otherwise. 

(5) This section is subject to section 120 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996. 

(6) In this section, ""debt"" means any liquidated claim.""

44The statutory right of set-off was reintroduced by the Civil Procedure Act 2005, following the repeal of earlier provisions on the basis that the only right of set-off should be an equitable right of set-off (Sydmar Pty Ltd v Statewise Developments Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 289 at 292). The NSW Law Reform Commission Report 94 (2000), ""Set-off"", recommended a reintroduction of the statutory right where it is restricted to ""mutual"" debts involving liquidated claims due and payable when the defence is filed: see Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (LexisNexis) at [21.5]. The statutory right of set-off does not extend to unliquidated claims. 

45In addition, while rights of cross-claims and indemnities pursuant to legislations such as the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) apply to defamation actions, the entitlement of a defendant to claim a set-off under the Civil Procedure Act 2005 is novel. The particulars provided are matters which would go to mitigation of damages, not to a set-off.

46I note these matters have been raised in the course of argument and that Mr McHugh had indicated that his clients would probably abandon this claim. Nevertheless, I have reserved the entitlement of the plaintiff to bring an application to strike out this portion of the pleading, so that the issue can be properly ventilated by a hearing on the merits.

47Another issue which may cause problems at the trial, but which was not referred to by the parties, is the determination of malice by joint tortfeasors where it is asserted that the malice of one infects the other so that both defendants are liable: Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331; Dougherty v Chandler & Ors (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 370 at 375-376; Egger v Viscount Chelmsford [1965] 1 QB 248. In LVMH, supra, at [66], Bergin A-JA referred to but did not decide the issue. 

48The present case has the additional complication of being one where it is likely (unlike LVMH, where liability by the NSW Police for statements of police officers was not in dispute) that vicarious liability issues may arise: Hay v Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers (1906) 3 CLR 1002 at 1011 - 12 per Griffiths CJ; Tobin & Sexton Australian Defamation Law and Practice [18,045]. A careful delineation of malice by each defendant is a matter to which the parties may wish to give consideration prior to the trial.

Orders

(1)Grant leave to the defendants to file the Further Amended Defence to the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim on the following provisos: 

(a)The defendants are to discover by Thursday 30 August 2012 at 5:00pm the documents identified in category 11 of the Short Minutes of Order dated 24 February 2012, namely income tax returns, balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of the first defendant from 1 June 2008 to date. 

(b)The defendants are also to discover by that date documents setting out the work being performed by the staff of the first defendant and its due dates at the relevant times (page 2 of the letter of the solicitors for the defendants dated 10 August 2012), as well as occupational health and safety work practices records and related documents. 

(c)The plaintiff's entitlement to bring an application to strike out the s 21 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) set-off claim is preserved.

(2)Pursuant to orders 1(a) and (b), the defendants are to provide copies of all discovered documents to the chambers of Ms L Evans by the due date and time.

(3)Waive the requirement for the defendants to provide a verified supplementary list of documents on condition that an index of these documents is provided.

(4)Any further particulars of malice must be provided by 5:00pm Thursday 30 August 2012 and any application to strike out those particulars may be brought on 31 August 2012 or such other times as are convenient to the parties.

(5)Matter stood over for directions to Friday 31 August 2012 at 10:15am before Gibson DCJ.

(6)Paragraph 2(ii)(f) of the Reply is struck out.

(7)Defendants' application to strike out paragraphs 2(ii)(c), (d) and (g) is dismissed.

(8)Defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the notice of motion (but this does not include the costs of the mediation).

(9)The notice of motion is otherwise dismissed.

SUMMARY OF CASE AND CONCLUSIONS
3In March 2003 Ms Janet Clyne, the appellant, was employed by Australia Post as a Post Service officer at the Spit Junction Post Office.  On 25 March 2003 she reported that a robbery had occurred whilst she was working at a counter at the Post Office.  She said that a man, whose appearance she described in some detail, presented her with a note saying that he had a gun and wanted the money she was counting.  She handed the money to the man who then fled.  Ms Clyne reported the robbery to another Post Office employee, the police were called and Ms Clyne provided a statement.
4In June 2003, an informant, Mr Daniel Munn, was interviewed by Detective Senior Constables Young and Cosgrove at North Sydney Police Station.  Mr Munn informed them that Mr Jamie Young had told him that he had robbed the Mosman Post Office (a reference to the Spit Junction Post Office) with the assistance of an employee (on the basis of the description given, clearly Ms Clyne) who ensured that the closed circuit television (""CCTV"") was not recording at the time of the robbery. 
5Subsequent police enquiries revealed that:
(a) There were numerous telephone contacts between Ms Clyne and Mr Young in the days before and after the robbery, including contact one hour prior to the robbery.
(b) The CCTV equipment at the Post Office was not operating at the time of the robbery.  It had been serviced in January 2003 and found to be working effectively.  It was Ms Clyne's responsibility to ensure that it was operating.  
(c) No other employee observed the robbery or the robber.
(d) At the time of the robbery, Ms Clyne's register contained six times the acceptable cash level stipulated in the Australia Post cash management plan.
6On 15 October 2003 Ms Clyne was arrested by Detective Cosgrove for ""stealing"" but was released from North Sydney Police Station within about an hour.  On 15 December 2003 police investigations were suspended ""due to lack of additional or other corroborative evidence to further implicate either CLYNE and/or YOUNG"" (Police Complaint Directive Memorandum dated 23 October 2006).
7On 2 October 2006 Ms Clyne commenced the present proceedings against the State of New South Wales claiming that it was vicariously liable for the conduct of the North Sydney police officers who wrongfully arrested her on 15 October 2003 and falsely imprisoned her for the short period that she was held at the police station on that day.  
8Service of Ms Clyne's statement of claim led to a ""Police Complaint Directive Memorandum"" dated 23 October 2006 from Detective Sergeant Flaherty to Detective Cosgrove requiring him to submit a comprehensive report stating his knowledge of the matter.  Thereafter the police conducted further investigations into the robbery and on 16 August 2007 served a Court Attendance Notice on Ms Clyne identifying Detective Cosgrove as the prosecutor of an offence under s 156 of the Crimes Act 1900 of ""steal property of master/employer"" at the Spit Junction Post Office on 25 March 2003.  Mr Young was served on 21 August 2007 with a Court Attendance Notice in relation to an offence of larceny arising out of the same incident. 
9After an eight day hearing in the Local Court of the criminal proceedings against Ms Clyne spread over April, August and December 2008, the charge against her was dismissed by Magistrate Marsden on 10 December 2008.  In August 2008 Mr Young had pleaded guilty to the charge against him.
10Ms Clyne then amended her Statement of Claim in the present proceedings to claim damages against the State for malicious prosecution by Detective Cosgrove.  The injuries that Ms Clyne alleged she sustained as a result of police misconduct include post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression.
11On 14 June 2011 the hearing of the present proceedings commenced before Fullerton J sitting in the Common Law Division of the Court.  On 22 June 2011, her Honour, on the application of the State under Part 29 r 10 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (""UCPR""), entered judgment for it on Ms Clyne's malicious prosecution claim (Clyne v State of New South Wales (No 1) [2011] NSWSC 629).  On 24 June 2011, again on an application by the State, her Honour entered judgment for it on Ms Clyne's wrongful arrest and false imprisonment claims (Clyne v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 630).  Rule 29.10 permits the Court to give judgment for a defendant after the conclusion of the plaintiff's case on the ground that ""on the evidence given, a judgment for the beginning party could not be supported"".  The applications here were made at the conclusion of Ms Clyne's case.
12Ms Clyne has sought leave to appeal against those judgments, contending that:
(1) The primary judge erred in refusing to disqualify herself for apprehended bias, principally said to arise out of her Honour raising matters at the hearing that were adverse to Ms Clyne's case and had not been raised by the State.  
(2) Her Honour erred in rejecting Ms Clyne's tender of police documents relating to the criminal background of Mr Munn and Mr Brad Hinsby (another informer) and the transcript of the Local Court proceedings against Ms Clyne.
(3) Her Honour erred in concluding that Ms Clyne did not adduce evidence capable of supporting her allegations of wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.
(4) Her Honour erred in finding that Ms Clyne did not lead evidence from which a conclusion could be drawn that Detective Cosgrove did not have reasonable and probable cause for his prosecution.
13For reasons given below, I do not consider that any of these contentions is well-founded.  As a result, Ms Clyne's applications for leave to appeal should be dismissed.  I have dealt with the issue of bias first, in conformity with the decision in Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55; 229 CLR 577 at [117].
THE RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES
Apprehended bias
14In Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; 244 CLR 427 the plurality observed:
""[31]  It has been established by a series of decisions of this court that the test to be applied in Australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (in this case, in the form of prejudgment) is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide ...
[32]  As the plurality in Johnson v Johnson explained, '[t]he hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge's conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by some judges of the capacity or performance of their colleagues'"" (Citations omitted).
Wrongful arrest and consequent false imprisonment
15At the time of Ms Clyne's arrest in 2003, s 352(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 permitted any police constable or other person to arrest without warrant any person in the act of committing or immediately after having committed ""an offence punishable, whether by indictment, or on summary conviction, under any Act"".  Section 352(2) was relevantly in the following terms:
""(2) Any constable may without warrant apprehend,
(a) any person whom the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed any such offence, 
...
and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law"".
16Section 356C and 356D in Part 10A of the Act relevantly provided as follows:
""356C  Detention after arrest for purposes of investigation
(1) A police officer may in accordance with this section detain a person, who is under arrest, for the investigation period provided for by section 356D.
(2) A police officer may so detain a person for the purpose of investigating whether the person committed the offence for which the person is arrested.
...
(4) The person must be:
(a) released (whether unconditionally or on bail) within the investigation period, or
(b) be brought before a Magistrate, authorised officer or other person or court within that period, or if it is not practicable to do so within that period, as soon as practicable after the end of that period.
(5) A requirement in another Part of this Act, the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the Bail Act 1978 or any other relevant law that a person who is under arrest be taken before a Magistrate, authorised officer or other person or court, without delay, or within a specified period, is affected by this Part only to the extent that the extension of the period within which the person is to be brought before such a Magistrate, authorised officer or other person or court is authorised by this Part.
...
356D Investigation period
(1) The investigation period is a period that begins when the person is arrested and ends at a time that is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, but does not exceed the maximum investigation period.
(2) The maximum investigation period is 4 hours or such longer period as the maximum investigation period may be extended to by a detention warrant.""
17The appeal was argued upon the basis that if the arrest of Ms Clyne was lawful, she would fail on both her false imprisonment and wrongful arrest claims.  
Malicious prosecution
18The elements of malicious prosecution were summarised in the plurality judgment in A v State of New South Wales [2007] HCA 10; 230 CLR 500 at [1] as follows:
""For a plaintiff to succeed in an action for damages for malicious prosecution the plaintiff must establish:  (1) that proceedings of the kind to which the tort applies (generally, as in this case, criminal proceedings) were initiated against the plaintiff by the defendant; (2) that the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff; (3) that the defendant, in initiating or maintaining the proceedings acted maliciously; and (4) that the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause.""
19Their Honours also observed:
""[38]  ... The question is whether the prosecutor had reasonable and probable cause to do what he did; not whether, regardless of the prosecutor's knowledge or belief, there was reasonable and probable cause for a charge to be laid. The question involves both an objective and a subjective aspect.
...
[56]  Even if a prosecutor is shown to have initiated or maintained a prosecution maliciously (for example, because of animus towards the person accused) and the prosecution fails, an action for malicious prosecution should not lie where the material before the prosecutor at the time of initiating or maintaining the charge both persuaded the prosecutor that laying a charge was proper, and would have been objectively assessed as warranting the laying of a charge.""
MATERIAL AVAILABLE TO THE POLICE
At the time of the arrest
20To the summary in [5] above of the material available to the police at the time of Ms Clyne's arrest should be added the following.  
21The police records included the following note of information supplied by Mr Munn on 21 May 2003:
""[Mr Munn] was informed [by Mr Young] that an employee of the post office would ensure the video CCTV was not recording at the time of the intended offence.  The informant [Mr Munn] was asked to act as a second principal by keeping 'a look out'.  The offer to participate in the robbery was declined.
The informant later had a conversation with the offender [Mr Young] who boasted about the commission of the offence.  The offender stated he had attended the post office and met the female employee at the counter who handed him the proceeds of the robbery.  The informant stated that the female employee was 41 years of age and currently on stress leave and would be seeking criminal compensation"".
22The record of an electronically recorded interview with Mr Munn on 13 June 2003 included the following statement by Mr Munn:
""[Mr Young] said ... if you want to make some money just come over with me to the Post Office at Mosman, I know the girl that works there.  She's told me that the cameras were down, so all we got to do is walk in and pick up a bag off her and then meet her after work and split the money with her"".
23Mr Munn also informed police that the woman from the Post Office, whom he knew to be named 'Janet or Jeannette', received a large proportion of the money taken from the Post Office and that the woman had told Mr Young that ""she'd get compo ... she'd get paid for going on stress leave"" (Judgment [15] and [16]).
24Further, the police ascertained that Mr Young's appearance was completely different to the description of the robber given by Ms Clyne.  The difference was so great that there was no reasonable possibility of a mistake on her part.  
At the time Ms Clyne was charged 
25After Ms Clyne's commencement of the present civil proceedings, and prior to her being charged, by means of service on her of the Court Attendance Notice, with the offence of ""steal property of master/employer"", the police took the following presently relevant steps:
(a) Mr Young was questioned at length in an electronically recorded interview.  He denied any involvement in the robbery.
(b) A signed statement was obtained from Mr Munn identifying Mr Young as a person ""who approached me in the year 2003 and asked me to participate in a staged robbery at Post Office on the North Shore"".  Mr Munn had not previously been prepared to sign a statement.  In an interview on 10 June 2007 Mr Munn indicated that, contrary to his previous position, he was now willing to give evidence against those allegedly involved in the theft (Judgment [29]).  
(c) A statement was obtained on 6 August 2007 from Mr Luke Mason, an employee of Australia Post, stating, inter alia, that:
Mr Young had been employed by Australia Post as a Postal Delivery Officer in the Spit Junction area between November 2001 and May 2002.An earlier attempted armed robbery had occurred at the Spit Junction Post Office on 27 August 2002.  In that incident Ms Clyne had been handed a note by a person stating that he had a gun and that money should be put in his bag.At the time of the reported robbery on 25 March 2003, Ms Clyne had Post Office cash in her register well in excess of that which was appropriate under normal procedures.No Australia Post employee other than Ms Clyne reported seeing the incident on 25 March 2003.The CCTV equipment at the Spit Junction Post Office was regularly serviced and no malfunction had been reported prior to the incident.  The hold-up alarm was activated on 25 March 2003 but Mr Mason did not say at what time that occurred.
(d) A statement was obtained from Mr Julian Hill who was the manager of the Spit Junction Post Office in March 2003.  Mr Hill supplied information concerning the maximum amount of cash that Ms Clyne should have had in her register and the operation of the CCTV security system.  He was not aware of any malfunction of the system after it was serviced in January 2003.  He said that the regular servicer of the system tested it on 26 March 2003, after the robbery, and found no defect.
26It is unnecessary to refer to the steps taken by the police between 16 August 2007, the date of service of the Court Attendance Notice upon Ms Clyne, and the conclusion in December 2008 of the hearing of the criminal proceedings against her as Ms Clyne's malicious prosecution claim in the present proceedings relates only to the initiation of the prosecution of Ms Clyne and not to its maintenance thereafter.  Her counsel confirmed this on the hearing of the appeal.  It is also apparent from Ms Clyne's Outline of Submissions at first instance dated 23 June 2010 [19].
THE JUDGMENTS AT FIRST INSTANCE
The judgment concerning the wrongful arrest and false imprisonment claims
27The primary judge referred to her discussions with Ms Clyne's counsel concerning the way in which these claims were put and concluded as follows:
""[34]  ...  Mr McAuley [counsel for Ms Clyne] did not articulate, or articulate with sufficient clarity, that his client's case of wrongful arrest was to be maintained on the basis that at the time of arrest police used their powers for an improper or collateral purpose. The closest he came to putting his client's case in a way that was consistent with her arrest (and subsequent detention) being unlawful was in the context of my enquiring of him as to how Particular 4.6 should be read and understood in light of his submissions that she was arrested for questioning. Mr McAuley submitted as follows: 
She wasn't arrested bona fide for the purpose of investigating if [she] committed an offence. She was arrested for an extraneous purpose, not bona fide purpose, namely for the purpose of questioning her with a view to obtaining admissions. And that's not a purpose which comes within section 352(2). 
[35]  It was on the basis of this further refinement of the plaintiff's case, which Mr McAuley assured me was the case he put on his client's behalf after careful consideration, that Mr Menzies [counsel for the State] then made a fresh application for judgment under Part 29 r 10"".
28Her Honour's conclusion that judgment should be entered for the State on these claims involved accepting the State's submissions as follows:
""[38]  Mr Menzies submitted that in circumstances where it was conceded that the arrest was on the basis of the police officer's reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff had committed the offence of larceny, and where it was common ground that upon her arrival at the police station she was entered into formal custody in accordance with the protocols provided by Pt 10A of the Crimes Act for the express purpose of investigating her involvement in the offence for which she was arrested by formally questioning her, the arrest was entirely lawful and in complete accordance with Part 10A of the Crimes Act .
[39]  In the context of the application for judgment under the UCPR he submitted that in these circumstances there was no evidence capable of supporting the plaintiff's case that the arrest was unlawful, or that she was falsely imprisoned consequent upon an unlawful arrest, and that judgment should be entered in the defendant's favour"". 
29A point raised by the State's Notice of Contention on appeal was that her Honour referred to the State's application in relation to the wrongful arrest and false imprisonment claims as being under r 29.10 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.  Both parties agreed that the application was in fact made under r 13.4 to strike out the Statement of Claim (or at least what remained of it after judgment was given for the State on the malicious prosecution claim) on the basis that it did not disclose any reasonable cause of action.  Nothing turns on her Honour's misunderstanding on this point.
The judgment concerning the malicious prosecution claim
30The primary judge noted that the State did not contend that the first two elements of the tort of malicious prosecution (the institution of criminal proceedings by the defendant and their termination in favour of the plaintiff) had not been established and noted that proof of the presence of malice (the fourth element) was insufficient if an absence of reasonable and probable cause (the third element) was not established (Judgment [39] - [41]).  Her Honour then observed:
""[41]  ...  Accordingly, even were I satisfied that there was some evidence of malice, evidenced by the informant's attitude toward the plaintiff when he served the Court Attendance Notice as deposed to by the plaintiff and her partner and/or by the suggestion that the proceedings were commenced by the informant as a 'payback' for her bringing proceedings for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, that would not be enough to support a verdict in her favour.""
31In relation to the subjective aspect of the element of absence of reasonable and probable cause (see [19] above), the primary judge concluded:
""[50]  The defendant submitted that there is no evidence at all to support the proposition that Detective Cosgrove did not honestly form the view that there was a case against the plaintiff which warranted or justified prosecution. He submitted that there was an abundance of evidence to support the fact that he held that honest belief. The plaintiff's counsel did not submit that there was any direct evidence of an absence of an honest belief but that, since the decision to charge the plaintiff was not based on a sufficiency of evidence, that supported an inference that he did not in fact have a honest belief that the evidence warranted setting the criminal law in motion. 
[51]  I am not persuaded that there is any force in the plaintiff's submission. Having regard to the weight of the evidence available to Detective Cosgrove at the time of service of the Court Attendance Notice, the inference that he did not have such a belief is simply untenable. For this reason alone the defendant's application for judgment in its favour must succeed. When separate consideration is given to the objective aspect of the allegation of absence of reasonable and probable cause I am compelled to the same conclusion.""
32Her Honour said the following in relation to the objective aspect:
""[53]  The plaintiff conceded that the body of circumstantial evidence available to police at the time of the service of the Court Attendance Notice, namely contact between the plaintiff and Jamie Young on the day of the robbery; the fact that the cash she had in her till far exceeded the office imposed limit and the fact that the CCTV equipment under her control was not functioning at the time of the alleged robbery, was sufficient to raise a suspicion of her criminal involvement in the theft, but that it was a weak circumstantial evidence case. That much might fairly be said. In fact, were that the only evidence it might well have supported a finding that the prosecutor acted without reasonable or probable cause in laying a charge based upon it. However it was not the only evidence. It is clear beyond question that the mainstay of the case against the plaintiff was the evidence of Munn. While it is equally as clear that Detective Cosgrove had concerns about his reliability as an informant, this was balanced against the fact that he provided police with information that was not in the public domain in 2003 and in 2006 expressed his willingness to give evidence concerning those matters without reward or inducement. Counsel openly conceded the circumstantial evidence case against the plaintiff was ""bolstered"" by the direct evidence of Munn but maintained the submission that the prosecution of the plaintiff suffered from a fatal deficiency which he was not able to identify. In these circumstances, his submission that there is a sufficiency of evidence to support a finding in the plaintiff's favour that the prosecution was commenced without reasonable or probable cause simply lacks any force with the corollary that the defendant's application for judgment must succeed.""
33The primary judge accordingly entered judgment for the State on the malicious prosecution claim.
34I turn now to the resolution of the application for leave to appeal. 
FIRST ISSUE - APPREHENDED BIAS
The course of the hearing at first instance
35The statement of claim current at the date of the hearing at first instance, the Fourth Amended Statement of Claim, listed as one of the particulars of Ms Clyne's malicious prosecution claim that she ""did not commit any offence of stealing on 25 March 2003"" ([9.1]).  In its defence, the State denied the allegation of malicious prosecution but, appropriately, did not respond specifically to the particulars.  The result was that the matter particularised was in issue in the proceedings, although such an issue is not, at least usually, appropriate to raise in a malicious prosecution claim (see Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Limited v Smith [1938] HCA 2; 59 CLR 527).
36In her evidence in chief, Ms Clyne was asked by her counsel whether she had participated in any way in the robbery on 25 March 2003.  She denied any involvement.
37Ms Clyne was cross-examined about a number of topics relevant to the robbery, including her friendship with Mr Young, her telephone contact with him, the CCTV at the Post Office, the maximum cash that she ought to have had in her register at the time of the robbery, the visual appearance of Mr Young, her conversations with Mr Young about whether he was involved in the robbery and his guilty plea.  In addition, the following exchanges occurred:
""Q. You see, let me suggest this to you.  Could this be the case, that you'd had some conversation with James Young at some point about an idea for a robbery, that it may even have just been a joke?
HER HONOUR
Q. The question is put:  have you ever discussed with James setting up a robbery of the post office, whether seriously or mucking about?A. No, not jokingly, not - never.
...
Q. Was this the case, that your conversations with Mr Young [after the robbery] were to the effect that each of you were [sic] to protect each other, to remain silent, not give the game away?A. There wasn't any game.
Q. Was this the case, that, shortly after the day of the robbery or, indeed that very evening, you met with Mr Young at a hotel on the North Shore and there divided the proceeds?A. No"" (Transcript 15/06/11, pp 129 and 133).
38In the course of discussion between counsel and the primary judge concerning the tender of the Facts Sheet used in relation to Mr Young's guilty plea, the following interchange occurred:
""MENZIES:
As we understand it, in fact unnecessarily, my learned friend put in issue the guilt of the plaintiff.  So, if I appear to be dancing around the proposition, it is because I am concerned that I don't do more than I need to or more than is permissible.
But, obviously, the authorities are pretty plain that, ultimately, guilt is irrelevant.  In this case, for reasons which are clear to my learned friend, he put in issue guilt, both pleaded it and then asked questions about it.
That being so, that issue, to some extent, becomes open, but I am not trying to re-run proceedings which have already been determined.
HER HONOUR:  No.  It is an important point of distinction.  I can see why the issue was pleaded and why you are dealing with it self-evidently, but of course Miss Clyne is entitled to the full benefit of having been acquitted"" (Transcript 15/06/11, p 136).
39Counsel for the State subsequently put to Ms Clyne in cross-examination that the description she gave police of the robber was ""a complete fabrication"", which she denied (Transcript p 138).
40The cross-examination to which I have referred in [37] - [39] above in my view confirmed the existence of an issue between the parties as to whether Ms Clyne was involved in the robbery.
41Each party engaged an expert to deal with the issues arising out of Ms Clyne's claim that she had suffered psychiatric injury as a result of police misconduct.  Dr Chanaka Wijeratne was engaged by Ms Clyne and Associate Professor Jonathan Phillips by the State.  The experts conferred with each other on questions agreed by the parties, and produced a document setting out their findings.
42Shortly prior to the two experts giving concurrent oral evidence, the following exchange occurred between the primary judge and counsel for the State:
""HER HONOUR:  ... Mr Menzies, I take it that you will ask both of the doctors to comment upon the way the plaintiff presented to Dr Wijeratne following the second robbery in the context of what I assume to be the defendant's case; namely, that she was in collusion with the robber.  Because Dr Wijeratne - and Dr Phillips accepts his diagnosis that she was, following the second robbery, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Now, both doctors have proceeded on the given or hidden assumption that she was traumatised when the robber came in and she having certainly no advance notice of it, and that her trauma relates to the fact that she was robbed as a victim.  But you are going to have to grapple with that diagnosis and how that diagnosis obtains in the event that you persuade me, as I expect you will, on the question of causation - that you will seek to persuade me on the probabilities that she was in collusion, and if I were satisfied of that on the probabilities as a foundation to the causation question, whether or not the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis obtains or whether it has to be in some way revisited.  Because that's a rather critical question, isn't it?
MENZIES:  Yes, your Honour.  The matters that really have to be taken up with both the doctors is, one, that.  Two is the effects of medication upon her presentation to various people at various times.  Three, the relevance of her other criminal history.  Four, the relevance of her alcohol history, particularly the 97-98 period and subsequently.  So there seem to be those four areas which need to be expanded upon. The way that I intend to do it would be simply to invite them to make some further assumptions, and then consider their evidence in light of those further assumptions.
...
HER HONOUR:  A person might, I assume suffer trauma in clinical terms consequent upon arrest, independent of whether the arrest was justified or unjustified.
MENZIES:  Indeed.
HER HONOUR:  And in the event that the arrest was both lawful and justified as a matter of fact because she was in fact in collusion with the robber, what happens to her claim in that instance, do you say?"" (Transcript 16/06/11, pp 227 - 228).
43Soon after, the following exchange occurred between the primary judge and counsel for Ms Clyne:
""McAULEY:  That interchange was, I think, useful, with respect, in clarifying some of the issues, but I should say that I will object to any question which operates on the assumption that there was collusion between Mr Young and the plaintiff.
HER HONOUR:  Why?
McAULEY:  Because I say that any such question would be inconsistent with the acquittal.
HER HONOUR:  I think what I should tell you is that you should take that objection; I will overrule it.
McAULEY:  Thank you, your Honour.
HER HONOUR:  But in the event that I am persuaded by you in the fullness of time that it is a proposition that cannot be revisited in this proceeding, then that question will fall away.  Otherwise we're going to have the doctors here until--
McAULEY:  No, I don't want that to happen.  I want to deal with this expeditiously.  So I just wanted to highlight that"" (Transcript 16/06/11, p 231).
44In the course of the experts' concurrent oral evidence, the primary judge posed two questions for the experts that asked them to assume that there had been collusion between Ms Clyne and the robber.  In response to a further objection from Mr McAuley, her Honour said:
""we'll return to resolve that in the course of the proceedings, don't think that you should not, if you wish, take up that question with either of the doctors and explore it further.  That's not going to undermine your objection in any way Mr McAuley"" (Transcript p 250 - 1)
45After Professor Phillips responded to her Honour's questions, Mr Menzies QC (counsel for the State) indicated that he wished to ask a question, said to have arisen out of Professor Phillips' response, upon the assumption that Ms Clyne was ""interested in benefiting from a compensation claim"".  Both experts responded and questions were put to them upon the further assumption that Ms Clyne had a criminal history.
46The day after the experts' evidence concluded, counsel for Ms Clyne sought to tender evidence as to what occurred at the hearing in the Local Court of the criminal charge against Ms Clyne.  In response to questions from the primary judge, counsel indicated that the material formed part of Ms Clyne's case that she was innocent of the criminal charge brought against her (Transcript p 264).  Counsel nevertheless contended that the State could not allege in the proceedings before her Honour that Ms Clyne had colluded with the robber because that would be to ""go behind the verdict in [Ms] Clyne's favour in the Local Court"" (Transcript p 265).  Counsel accepted on appeal that this submission was not well-founded and that the verdict of acquittal did not preclude the issue of collusion being raised in the civil proceedings (see generally Helton v Allen [1940] HCA 20; 63 CLR 691; J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence, 8th ed (2010) LexisNexis Butterworths [5215]).
47After a lengthy discussion between the primary judge and counsel, Mr McAuley indicated that he no longer sought to prove Ms Clyne's innocence as part of his case (Transcript p 285) and, after further discussion, counsel for the State responded by withdrawing any suggestion that Ms Clyne had colluded with the robber.  The primary judge then confirmed that the questions asked of the experts ""on an assumed basis that Ms Clyne was in collusion with the robber"" would be disregarded (Transcript p 300).
48On 22 June 2011, the seventh day of the hearing, the primary judge delivered her judgment in favour of the State on Ms Clyne's malicious prosecution claim.  After counsel for Ms Clyne then explained her case on wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, the primary judge suggested to counsel for the State that he withdraw the State's application for judgment on those claims because the application looked ""problematic"".  The State then withdrew the application.  
49On the next morning however, counsel for the State said that he needed confirmation of the way in which Ms Clyne put her case on those claims.  Lengthy discussion in which her Honour sought clarification of that case then ensued.  After a short adjournment, counsel for Ms Clyne applied for her Honour to disqualify herself, saying:
""McAULEY:  I'm instructed to make an application that your Honour disqualify yourself.  The basis of the application is on the basis of bias.  The evidentiary material upon which I rely is the question by your Honour when the experts Dr Phillips and Dr Wijeratne were before the Court, and your Honour's questions in relation to the alleged collusion.
The second evidentiary basis is the suggestion by your Honour yesterday that Mr Menzies withdraw his application.  It wasn't a situation where Mr Menzies withdrew his application, as it were, on his own initiative, the suggestion coming from your Honour.
And thirdly, the interchange with the exchange that's occurred this morning in relation to the plaintiff's case.
HER HONOUR:  Yes, that application is refused"" (Transcript 23/06/11, pp 381 - 382).
50Counsel for the State then made an application that ""the Statement of Claim be struck out on the basis that it doesn't reveal a cause of action"" (Transcript p 382).  The primary judge delivered judgment on that application on 24 June 2011.
Consideration 
51On appeal Ms Clyne contended, on the same three bases relied upon at first instance, that the primary judge should have disqualified herself.  She also contended that her Honour erred in giving no reasons for her refusal of the disqualification application.
52Ms Clyne's first complaint was, and is, that her Honour raised with the experts the issue of possible collusion of Ms Clyne in the robbery (see [42] above).  In light of the way in which Ms Clyne's case had been conducted to that point, there was in my view no error in her Honour doing that.  The statement of claim, the defence, Ms Clyne's evidence in chief and the State's cross-examination of her (see [40]) combined to indicate that there was an issue between the parties as to whether Ms Clyne had colluded in the robbery.  It was appropriate for her Honour to ensure that the experts' oral evidence did not pass without this issue being addressed, to avoid the expense and inconvenience of recalling the experts at a later time.  In taking this course her Honour was complying with ss 56 - 58 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 which require ""the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the dispute or proceedings"".  
53A related complaint made by Ms Clyne on appeal was that following the primary judge's questions to the experts upon the assumption of collusion, the State was permitted to question the experts on the assumption that Ms Clyne had been motivated by a desire to benefit from a compensation claim (see [45] above).  Her Honour did not rule against Ms Clyne's objection to this occurring:  she had made it clear that Ms Clyne's various objections would be determined at a later point.  That point was never reached as the issue of collusion (and therefore of Ms Clyne's motivation) was withdrawn from the proceedings (see [47] above) and the relevant questions to the experts came to be disregarded.  Again in my view the primary judge's conduct was unimpeachable.
54Even if, contrary to my view, the primary judge was mistaken in considering that collusion was an issue in the proceedings, there was undoubtedly enough in the parties' conduct to provide a reasonably arguable foundation for such a view.  In those circumstances, there is no substance at all in Ms Clyne's contention that her Honour's conduct of the hearing in this respect (or indeed in any other respect) might have given an appearance of bias to a fair-minded lay observer (see the test referred to in [14] above).
55Likewise, the primary judge's suggestion that counsel for the State withdraw his application for judgment was entirely proper in light of the information that counsel for Ms Clyne had at that stage supplied to her Honour about Ms Clyne's case.  Again, the primary judge was complying with ss 56 - 58 of the Civil Procedure Act:  in this instance by discouraging a party (not, it should be noted, Ms Clyne) from pursuing an apparently unmeritorious application.
56The third reason Ms Clyne gave to her Honour for the disqualification application was similarly without foundation.  It was entirely proper for her Honour to attempt to clarify the nature of Ms Clyne's case.
57I also reject Ms Clyne's submission that the primary judge erred in not giving reasons for her rejection of the disqualification application.  The application was so clearly ill-founded that no reasons were required.  Indeed little more could have been said in response to the application than that her Honour, in attempting to clarify Ms Clyne's case, in dissuading counsel from running what she then perceived to be a groundless application and in ensuring that the expert witnesses addressed all relevant issues in the proceedings, was simply performing her duties under ss 56 - 58 of the Civil Procedure Act.  This would have been apparent to any fair-minded observer of the proceedings and did not need to be spelt out.
SECOND ISSUE - THE REJECTION OF EVIDENCE
Evidence of the criminal background of the two informers
58The primary judge rejected the tender of voluminous documents relating to the criminal records of Mr Munn and Mr Hinsby, in effect, upon the basis that the documents could not reasonably establish that the information provided to police ""was so wholly unreliable ... that the police should not have placed any reliance upon it"" and that it was therefore irrelevant (Transcript p 24).
59Ms Clyne's complaint about the rejection of this evidence, so far as it related to Mr Munn, should in my view be dismissed upon the basis that the evidence otherwise before her Honour demonstrated that the police were aware that when Mr Munn supplied information to them he was on bail for robbery and had an extensive criminal history (NSW Police Service COPS entry).  Further detail concerning that record would not have assisted Ms Clyne's case.  The primary judge was therefore correct to treat it as irrelevant.
60Police obtained statements from Mr Hinsby, a cousin of Mr Young, on 29 October 2007 and 25 February 2008, after the criminal charge was laid against Ms Clyne and well after her arrest.  If police obtained any information from Mr Hinsby prior to that time (which is not suggested by the parties' chronologies) it did not, and does not, play any significant role in determining the propriety of the police conduct in arresting and charging Ms Clyne.  As a result, the primary judge rightly rejected evidence about Mr Hinsby's past as irrelevant.
Transcript of the Local Court proceedings
61Counsel for Ms Clyne was not able at first instance (Transcript p 308) or in his Written Submissions on appeal ([30]) to proffer any plausible reason why the tender of the transcript of the Local Court hearing in 2008 would have assisted Ms Clyne in demonstrating that the police acted improperly in arresting her in October 2003 and charging her in August 2007.  In these circumstances, her Honour was right to reject the tender of the transcript.
THIRD ISSUE - WHETHER WRONGFUL ARREST AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT
62Ms Clyne's argument on appeal was put as follows:
""[T]he trial judge mis-stated the applicant's case on wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, failing to acknowledge the applicant's case on wrongful arrest - that she was not arrested bona fide in accordance with s 352(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), with the intention of taking the applicant before an authorised justice to be dealt with according to law, but for the purpose of questioning, which turned into harassment and bullying at North Sydney Police Station"" (Written Submissions [56]).
63As is apparent from [11] above the primary judge identified, and rejected, the submission to this effect made by Ms Clyne at first instance.  Her Honour was correct to do so as s 352(2) (quoted in [15] above) neither explicitly nor implicitly authorised arrests only if they were effected for the purpose of taking the person arrested before an authorised Justice.  It simply required the constable to in fact take the arrested person before a court.  However if some other statutory provision came into operation before the arrested person was taken before a court, the obligation to take the arrested person before a court might be displaced.  Consistently with ss 356C and D, the arresting officer's intent at the time of arrest might lawfully have been only to question the person and deal with him or her as required by s 356C(4), that is, release the person or bring him or her before an authorised Justice.  I agree with the view to this effect expressed by Adams J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Nicholls [2001] NSWSC 523; 123 A Crim R 66 at [15] - [16].
64Ms Clyne's submission quoted in [62] above must therefore be rejected.  Even if Ms Clyne established that the arrest was ""for the purpose of questioning"", that would not have invalidated it.  Furthermore, the ""harassment and bullying"" referred to in the submission was not alleged to have been the, or a, purpose of the arrest.  The latter point is emphasised by the use of the words ""turned into"" in the submission.  As the primary judge said at [33]:
""[A]t no time did [counsel for Ms Clyne] seek to make the case that at the time of arrest it was the intention of the police officer to question the plaintiff informally in the intimidating environment of detention with a view to extracting admissions from her, and that for that reason that her arrest was affected for the improper purpose of questioning her in that particular way"".
65In my view the material in the possession of the police at the time of Ms Clyne's arrest (see [5], [20] - [24] above) clearly constituted reasonable cause for suspicion that Ms Clyne had committed a relevant offence (see s 352(2)).  Counsel for Ms Clyne, quite properly, made the following concessions in this respect at first instance:
""MCAULEY:  They had a suspicion and I'm happy to concede that police officers investigating a matter quite properly act on suspicions.
HER HONOUR:  And do you concede that they had available to them at the time of her arrest reasonable evidence to ground a reasonable suspicion that she was implicated in the robbery?
MCAULEY:  I wouldn't phrase it quite that way.  I would say that there was a suspicion which was such that it was appropriate to further investigate the matter.  That's how I would phrase it.
HER HONOUR:  And it was entirely appropriate to further investigate the matter by putting the allegations to Mrs Clyne?
MCAULEY:  Yes"" (Transcript 21 June 2011, p 337).
66On appeal counsel argued that his concessions stopped short of admitting that the relevant suspicion was reasonable.  It seems to me that this was implicit in the concessions but in any event there can be no doubt that the suspicion was reasonable.  
67As there is no other challenge to the primary judge's decision concerning the wrongful arrest and false imprisonment claims, Ms Clyne's contention that the primary judge erred in finding that a judgment for Ms Clyne on those claims could not be supported on the evidence before her must be rejected.
FOURTH ISSUE - MALICIOUS PROSECUTION CLAIM
68It is not easy to identify precisely what Ms Clyne's argument is concerning the primary judge's conclusion on this claim.  At its highest, it appears to be a contention that because the investigation was suspended for some years and only restarted when Ms Clyne commenced the present civil proceedings against the State, an inference should be drawn that the police only charged her, to use the primary judge's expression (Malicious Prosecution Judgment [41]), as ""payback"" for her bringing the civil proceedings.  As her Honour noted, this contention might support an argument that the police acted maliciously but Ms Clyne would still need to show an absence of reasonable and proper cause for the prosecution in order to succeed on her claim (ibid).
69As the plurality in A v State of New South Wales confirmed, the element of reasonable and probable cause is concerned with the sufficiency of the material before the prosecutor ""to warrant setting the processes of the criminal law in motion"" (at [71]).  At least where, as here, the complaint relates to the institution of criminal proceedings, as distinct from their maintenance up to and during trial, the focus is not on whether the police possessed admissible evidence enabling them to prove that the person charged has committed an offence (see Thomas v State of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 316; 74 NSWLR 34 at [105]).  After charge, ordinarily much work will occur in the collection and preparation of evidence for trial.  The relevant question is whether the material available at the time of charge warrants those ""wheels"" being put in motion.  Ms Clyne did not in fact contend that the decision to charge her lacked a reasonable basis because, although the material possessed by the police might have been sufficient to generate a reasonable belief in Ms Clyne's guilt, much of it (particularly the hearsay evidence of Mr Munn) would not have been admissible against her at a hearing of the criminal charge.
70The primary judge concluded that ""[h]aving regard to the weight of the evidence available to Detective Cosgrove at the time of service of the Court Attendance Notice, the inference that he did not have [an honest belief that the evidence warranted setting the criminal law in motion] is simply untenable"" (Judgment [51]).  On appeal Ms Clyne has not given any plausible reason for regarding that conclusion as erroneous.  There was considerable material available to the police at the time of Ms Clyne's arrest (see [65] above) and it was to some extent supplemented by the time she was charged (see [25] above).  As her Honour concluded, Ms Clyne's case did not provide any reason for thinking that Detective Cosgrove did not believe that he had sufficient material to warrant charging Ms Clyne.  The fact that the police may have been prompted to pursue the matter by the commencement of Ms Clyne's civil proceedings does not in my view indicate otherwise.
ORDERS
71For the reasons I have given, an appeal by Ms Clyne would be bound to fail.  As a result, I propose that her application for leave to appeal be dismissed with costs.
72MEAGHER JA:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

		24 August 2012",2012-08-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2759933,"R v WOTHERSPOON, Anne Maree [2012] NSWSC 1641","Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The accused, Ms Anne Wotherspoon, is charged with murder and with robbery in company.  It is unnecessary to examine the Crown case.  It is sufficient to say that she is alleged to have been a party to a joint criminal enterprise to rob the deceased in the course of which the deceased met her death.  The issue of her fitness to be tried is before me and the resolution of that issue appears to be clear.  I have reports from two respected forensic psychiatrists, Professor David Greenberg, engaged by the Crown, and Dr Richard Furst, engaged by the defence. 
2What emerges from those reports is that the accused has a history of mental illness, described by Dr Furst as treatment resistant schizophrenia.  That history is well documented in the reports.  Both doctors interviewed the accused on two occasions and on each of those occasions each doctor observed her to be exhibiting psychotic symptoms, describing bizarre and disturbing delusions.  It does seem that such medication as she has been persuaded to take has only to a limited extent relieved her condition. 
3On both occasions each doctor found her to be unfit to be tried, giving their reasons at some length in their reports.  It is sufficient for present purposes to extract the relevant portions of their recent reports, which are to much the same effect as their earlier reports. Professor Greenberg saw the accused on the second occasion on 18 August this year and provided a report on 19 August.   On the question of fitness to be tried he reported the following:
""I assessed Ms Wotherspoon with regard to Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48 and Keseavarajah vs R (1994) 123 ALR 463 criteria.
Ms Wotherspoon understood in rudimentary terms the nature of the charges.
She was unable to understand the available pleads (sic) to her at this time.  She did not understand what guilty or not guilty meant.  She did not understand the consequence of such pleads.
She did not understand the nature of an oath or the consequences of perjury.
With regard to the roles of the functions of the various officers in the Court, she stated that her lawyer helped her and he tells the truth. She stated that her lawyer is Mark Mansell who works for Legal Aid in Newcastle.  She did not understand the role of the prosecutor.  She stated that the Judge sentences people but did not fully understand the role of the Judge.  She did not understand the role of a jury; how many members sat on a jury or how they were selected.  She understood that she was the accused.  She stated that a witness tells the truth 'about anything to Judge'.  Ms Wotherspoon did not understand the purpose of the future Court hearings.  She stated that 'they' wanted her in gaol and would lock her up forever.
I am of the opinion that Ms Wotherspoon could not appreciate the substantial affect of evidence given in Court at this time because of her acute psychotic mental illness.
I am of the opinion that Ms Wotherspoon would be unable to instruct legal counsel at this time because of the current nature of her severe mental illness.
I am therefore of the opinion that on balance Ms Wotherspoon is currently unfit to plead and unfit to stand trial.""
4Dr Furst in his most recent report was of the same view.  He had been treating the accused over a period of time, I  should add.  He saw the accused for the second time quite recently, on 22 August, and provided a report of 24 August.  He expressed his view in this way:
""Ms Wotherspoon has limited appreciation of her legal situation, mental illness and the role of the Court.  She has features of a chronic treatment resistant schizophrenic illness and remains a mentally ill person in the acute setting of the Long Bay Hospital.  It appears that her progress over the last 10 months has been very limited, with no real resolution of her acute delusions and auditory hallucinations.
She would probably struggle to work with her legal counsel, pay attention to what is said in Court, and give coherent instructions.  Her capacity to make out her defence in Court, if any, would be impaired by delusions about the 'Mafia' and various other paranoid themes.
I remain of the opinion that Ms Wotherspoon would struggle to participate in a trial in a meaningful sense because of the severity of her psychotic illness, her ongoing paranoid delusions and her tendency to incorporate her legal regenerative (sic ""representative"") and various other legal actors in the court into her delusional system
Having regard to the standards of Presser (1958) VR 45 and Kesavarajah (1994) 74 A Crim R 100, I was of the opinion that Ms Wotherspoon remains unfit to be tried.  Given her limited progress over the last 15 months at the Long Bay Hospital and the chronicity of her schizophrenic illness, it is unlikely that she will become fit to be tried in the next 12 months.""
5I should add that Ms Wotherspoon has the benefit of being represented by very experienced senior counsel, Mr Rosser QC. He told me from the Bar table that he and his instructing solicitor have faced the very difficulties of which the psychiatrists speak.  To put it shortly, he said that they were unable to obtain rational instructions from the accused in preparation for her trial.  It is abundantly clear that she is unfit to be tried, and I so find.  My formal orders are these:
6I find the accused unfit to be tried.   In accordance with section 14 (a) of the Mental Health Forensic Provisions Act 1990, I refer the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  In accordance with section 14 (b) (iii) of the Act, I remand the accused in custody until the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to section 16 of the Act.
7I direct the Registrar of the Supreme Court to provide the following documentation to the Mental Health Review Tribunal within 14 days: 
(a)a copy of my finding and reasons; (b)a copy of the orders I made; (c)a copy of the transcript of proceedings; (d)copies of the psychiatric reports; and(e)a copy of the Crown Case Statement.

2759945,King v R [2012] NSWCCA 185,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2HALL J:  I agree with the reasons and conclusions of R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  Mr Anthony King sought leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by her Honour Judge Tupman in the District Court on 25 August 2011 for an offence of conspiring with others, between 27 July and 11 December 2003, to import prohibited imports, namely a commercial quantity of ecstasy.  The offence was contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (as it existed at the time of the offence) and s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) and the maximum penalty was life imprisonment.  The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.
4The applicant had been arrested in the United Kingdom in December 2003.  The delay in sentencing was largely because of his efforts to contest extradition to Australia which ultimately occurred in February 2010.  A plea of guilty was entered in October 2010.
5After hearing the application on Friday 17 August 2012 the Court announced its decision that leave to appeal was refused.  These are my reasons for joining in that decision.
6The applicant proposed three grounds of appeal which invoke the parity principle:
1. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in sentencing the Appellant to a sentence of 16 years, with 10 years non-parole, which was disparate to the sentence and non-parole periods imposed on the Co-offenders to an extent beyond what was appropriate to Her Honours findings. 2. The sentence and non-parole period imposed by Her Honour was in error in failing to observe a proper parity or relativity with that imposed on the Co-offender Henry.
3. The sentence and non-parole period were manifestly excessive having regard to the [sic] Her Honour's findings and the sentences imposed on the Co-offenders.
7Notwithstanding the formulation of the grounds, Mr James QC made clear at the hearing that the challenge to the sentence was confined to the non-parole period.  He further clarified that such challenge was based solely upon an unacceptable level of disparity between the applicant's non-parole period and that of two co-offenders (Mohamad Alchikh and Peter Henry).  Their respective sentences were:
Applicant:   16 years - non-parole period 10 years
Alchikh: 12 years - non-parole period 7 years 3 months
Henry:  11 years - non-parole period 7 years
8There is an abundance of cases in which the parity principle has been discussed and explained and it is unnecessary to embark upon the same exercise here.  The most recent and authoritative discussion is to be found in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28]-[34]; [105]-[106]. 
Facts
9Given the nature of the grounds of appeal it is unnecessary to explore the facts in all their detail.  I will largely confine my remarks to the activities of the applicant and the two co-offenders who are relevant to the parity issue. Except where indicated, the following is drawn from the judge's sentencing remarks.
10There was a drug trafficking syndicate based in the United Kingdom and Australia which imported about 165,000 ecstasy tablets weighing almost 32 kilograms into Australia in December 2003.  A police investigation of the syndicate had been underway for the previous 6 months.
11The drugs were imported in a shipping container inside the doors of six refrigerators as part of a larger importation of 54 refrigerators.  There had been two previous ""dummy runs"" importing of refrigerators.  The drugs were intercepted upon arrival in Melbourne.  Arrests occurred after syndicate members retrieved an inert substance that police had substituted for the drugs within the fridge doors.
12The applicant travelled to Australia in September 2003 for a week for the purpose of meeting with others to discuss the plan to import the drugs.  He had previously consulted with others in the United Kingdom in relation to funding and sourcing drugs for the importation. The judge found that at this stage of the planning, the applicant was ""in something of an equal role"" with two other men, referred to as Cerisola and Salhani; the applicant was responsible for the organisation, Salhani for the money and Cerisola for sourcing the drugs.
13Peter Henry was a citizen of the United Kingdom who had come to live in Sydney in November 2002 (AB 293).  He was described by the judge as the applicant's ""trusted friend and associate"".  The applicant frequently discussed the planned importation with him and knew Henry would be in a position to organise others in Sydney to facilitate it.  Her Honour said, ""[t]o that extent [the applicant] was playing a very significant role at that stage in this importation, in fact setting it up or organising its inception.""
14Mohamad Alchikh, a Sydney based conspirator, travelled to London in October 2003 to discuss the plan with the applicant and Salhani.  By this time the applicant had decided to secrete the drugs inside refrigerator doors, as opposed to a previous plan to secrete them inside cranes. It was the applicant who had the contact in London that enabled the refrigerators to be purchased and his involvement included arranging the two earlier ""dummy run"" importations.  He had conversations with Alchikh and Henry about the success of these ""dummy runs"".  The judge said that she found the terms of these conversations had the ""flavour of Alchikh and Henry reporting the outcome to [the applicant]"". 
15The judge also found that the applicant was ""integrally involved in organising for the refrigerators with the concealed ecstasy to leave the United Kingdom on 2 November 2003 on their way to Melbourne."" 
16Reference was then made in the sentencing remarks to the preparatory activity of various syndicate members in Australia for the arrival of the drugs, such as liaising with freight forwarders, leasing factory premises, transportation and the like.  The applicant was in constant contact with Henry discussing these various arrangements and activities.  Again, her Honour found that these conversations had the ""flavour of Henry reporting day-to-day activities"" to the applicant.  
17At this point of her remarks the judge observed that the applicant and Henry each stood to gain the benefit from 35,000 of the 165,000 tablets and were to each obtain ""roughly the same financial gain"". But whilst the judge said that this was a relevant matter in determining their roles, she added that ""it is not determinative"". Reference was made to a claim by the applicant that he stood to gain £120,000 and, later, to a contention by the Crown that his gain would have been significantly greater.  The dispute was not resolved, her Honour being content to find that ""[w]hatever the amount that he was to receive, it was clearly for financial gain and it was a relatively large amount.""
18On 27 November 2003 there was a discussion between the applicant and an undercover operative who had infiltrated the syndicate in relation to the supply of ecstasy tablets.  The applicant told the operative that there was a consignment already on its way to Australia.  They also discussed further supplies of large quantities of the drug.  The terms of the conversation led the judge to the ""impression"" that the applicant was ""in control"" and ""a key organiser of this drug importation"". 
19Reference was then made to conversations and activities of syndicate members related to clearing of the shipment through customs, and transporting it to a location in Melbourne and ultimately to Sydney.  In this context her Honour referred to Henry as having ""played a significant and pivotal role in this syndicate"". His activities included organising for another person (referred to as Warner) to come to Australia to assist once the drugs arrived in Sydney.
20The shipment arrived in Melbourne on 3 December 2003.  The applicant had another conversation with the undercover operative about the latter paying $500,000 for the drugs.  What were thought to be the drugs were transported to Sydney (the substitution of the inert substance by police having occurred in Melbourne).  Two syndicate members set about retrieving the substance and took it to a proposed meeting with Henry to provide it to him. It was at that point that arrests were made.
21The judge turned to the question of the applicant's role.  She accepted a Crown submission that he was ""a key organiser whose role was critical to the success of the importation and that he was either the syndicate's principal or, at the least, a very senior member.""  She noted that invariably in such cases there no evidence of ""one overarching principal"".  Her Honour found:
As I have already said, it seems to me that there would appear to have been at least three people operating in the United Kingdom somewhat equally, involved at a senior level, namely Salhani organising the funding, Cerisola sourcing the drugs and [the applicant] overseeing the organisation of the importation from the United Kingdom.  I accept that he did that in large part through Henry who was already in Sydney and who was a trusted friend.  But it seems to me, on the evidence, that [the applicant] played a greater role in this importation than Henry, even though of course Henry was pivotal.
Equally with Henry so was Alchikh a pivotal member of this syndicate.  [The applicant] also undertook some of his organisation of this importation from the United Kingdom by contact with Alchikh. (ROS 9 - 10)
22A number of ways in which the applicant's role was thought to be ""pivotal"" were then set out, before her Honour said:
Without in any way diminishing Henry's role, which as I have said was also pivotal, the role played by [the applicant], it seems to me on that basis, was more significant and as a result the sentence that he receives should be greater as a result of his increased role. (ROS 11)
23The findings made by the judge as to the role played by the applicant, relative to that of other members of the syndicate, were not subject to any challenge in this Court.
Subjective matters
24There is no challenge to any of the conclusions reached as to the applicant's subjective circumstances and no attempt has been made to claim that they are relevant to the grounds of appeal.  One matter worthy of note, however, is that her Honour received evidence of assistance the applicant had provided to authorities while he was incarcerated in the United Kingdom.  The details are presently unimportant but the ultimate result was that her Honour reduced the sentence she otherwise would have imposed by 20 per cent for the combination of the applicant's late plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities.  The sentence of 16 years would otherwise have been one of 20 years.
25Another subjective matter of note is that the applicant had what was described as ""a lengthy relevant criminal history including one conviction with imprisonment in the United Kingdom for a conspiracy to supply drugs in 1990 and another conviction for importing illegal drugs in 1991 for which he received a sentence of twelve years.""
26The challenge to the sentence on parity grounds is confined to the length of the non-parole period, so it is also appropriate to note that the judge referred to the fact that the applicant had been held in maximum security since his arrest in 2003, a lengthy period of time albeit largely as a result of his various attempts to avoid extradition.  Her Honour said that she took this into account in determining the appropriate non-parole period.  It was also stated later in her remarks that:
The appropriate non-parole period should reflect the minimum period of time which justice requires that he serve to reflect all of the circumstances of the offence.  It must also take into account factors involving the offender himself and the nature of his incarceration and in this case ... this includes the whole time being spent in maximum security and that for the last eighteen months it was well away from his family and friends.  The non-parole period should also allow for a reasonable period on parole, no doubt eventually in the United Kingdom, hopefully with supervision, in an attempt to reintegrate him into the law abiding community. (ROS 23-24)
The judge's approach to parity
27It is significant that her Honour was well aware of the relevance and importance to the sentencing exercise of the parity principle.  She said:
I then turn to what is the appropriate sentence given these findings in relation to the objective criminality and the subjective circumstances of the offender.  The significant issue is that of parity or relativity.  There is no strict parity with any of those others who have been sentenced.  They all are different in one way or the other, either in relation to their role, the offence for which they have been sentenced, whether or not it was after a plea of guilty or following trial and similar issues.  I have, however, been provided with and have read the remarks on sentence in relation to those six others who have been sentenced to finality in New South Wales for this importation.  They include Alchikh, Hands and Alkarim sentenced by Judge Woods, Henry and Gravett sentenced by me and Swansson sentenced by Judge Zhara.
It is argued that, as I have said, I should regard this offender as being on equal footing with Henry and pay significant regard to that and the sentence that Henry received in determining the appropriate sentence.  I have already addressed the issue in relation to their respective roles.  However, whilst his role is more significant for the reasons I have found, the sentences should bear some relativity.  Further, when comparing Henry's sentence, I also take into account that he was being sentenced not for the same offence of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of ecstasy, but for the offence of aiding and abetting and attempt to possess these drugs.  That is the basis on which I sentenced him.  In those sentence proceedings I found that on the facts of Henry's case this differentiation in charge did not, to any great extent, diminish Henry's objective criminality and, of course, the maximum penalty for the offence was the same.  However, there is some difference between the two.  Not only did this offender play a larger role than Henry, further Henry was sentenced for something which is, in its own terms, somewhat less serious.  I was also, in the Henry case, constrained by the sentence originally imposed by Judge Woods after trial initially, that is overall an eighteen year term with a non-parole period of eleven years.
I am mindful, and take into account too, the sentence imposed on Alchikh in circumstances where he pleaded guilty to exactly the same offence of conspiracy to import.  He was given a thirty-three per cent overall discount which led to an overall sentence of twelve years with a non-parole period of seven years and three months.  His role was found to be very significant but it seems to me, for the same reasons as I expressed in relation to Henry, he too played a somewhat smaller role than this offender in this particular offence.  Alchikh's was an early plea of guilty and the sentencing judge allowed him a discount of twenty per cent for that plea.  It follows that the sentencing judge must have used eighteen years as the appropriate starting point also for Alchikh.  That is the same starting point originally used by Judge Woods for the first sentence of Henry.  I take that into account.  I reduced that when sentencing Henry ultimately to a lower figure for the reasons that I set out, namely the plea of guilty, albeit late, and the actual offence for which he has been sentenced. (ROS 21-23)
Sentencing of Mohamad Alchikh
28Mohamad Alchikh was sentenced by his Honour Judge Woods QC on 31 August 2005.  He had pleaded guilty to a charge in the same terms and with the same maximum penalty as the applicant with the only differences being matters of particulars (the commencement date of the conspiracy and explicit nomination of co-conspirators). 
29According to the remarks on sentence of Woods DCJ, Alchikh's role was ""to arrange the importation, to organise the warehouse, then others of [the applicant's] associates were left in a position of being able to take the drugs ... out of the refrigerators with the intention no doubt of selling them in Australia to a person or persons unknown"" (AB 177).  His Honour also found that ""his role was that of an organiser of the importation rather than of the proposed on-sale of the drugs thereafter.  He was in frequent contact with Salhani, an old friend of his, and [the applicant's] offsider.  He actually went to England to liaise with the head of the conspiracy, [the applicant]. ... He expected some major reward from the conspiracy, namely the foregoing of any debts he had to [the applicant]"" (AB 179 - 180).
30Alchikh had ""no relevant prior convictions"". There was a plea of guilty in the Local Court and significant (""but not major"") co-operation with authorities. The latter included that a statement by him had been used in the extradition proceedings against the applicant. 
31Woods DCJ determined that all objective and subjective circumstances called for a sentence of 18 years.  He allowed for a reduction of one-third on account of Alchikh's plea of guilty and assistance to authorities, resulting in a term of 12 years.  In relation to the non-parole period, his Honour noted that Alchikh had been freed through administrative error whilst on remand but had voluntarily surrendered himself back to custody, and that he had been held for almost 20 months in ""high level protective custody"".  For those reasons his Honour reduced the non-parole period he would otherwise have imposed from 8 years to 7 years 3 months. 
Sentencing of Peter Henry
32Tupman DCJ sentenced the co-offender Peter Henry on 14 August 2009.  He had pleaded guilty at a point at which his third trial was in jeopardy in the fourth week because of illness to jurors.  He had previously been convicted after trial of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of ecstasy and sentenced by Woods DCJ to 18 years with a non-parole period of 11 years.  The conviction and sentence were quashed on appeal.  A second trial resulted in a jury being unable to agree.  The Crown ultimately accepted a plea to a charge of aiding and abetting others to possess a commercial quantity of a prohibited import.  The period referred to in the charge was confined to 12 to 17 December 2003.  However, the charge carried the same maximum penalty as the conspiracy of life imprisonment.
33Tupman DCJ accepted from the facts before her in Henry's case that the applicant was ""a principal of this syndicate and the UK based organiser of it"".  She referred to the sentencing remarks of Woods DCJ which included that Alchikh ""played a significant role in the importation of these drugs including being involved in the financing of it and recruiting others to assist in the importation"".  She determined that Henry was ""the Sydney based co-ordinator of those who would in fact take possession of these drugs.  ...[He] was trusted by [the applicant] to undertake this important organisational role as something in the nature of a deputy to him"".
34As to the relative seriousness of offences, her Honour said:
I come to sentence him not for conspiracy to import, however, but for aiding and abetting and [sic - an] attempt to possess those prohibited imports.  The offence before me I accept almost in its terms, is qualitatively less serious than an offence for conspiracy to import.  However, I accept that whilst somewhat less serious, the distinction is not large. (AB 289)
So, whilst this offence before me is different to that sentenced by Judge Woods and, in fact, ought be regarded as less serious, therefore leading to a lower sentence than that originally imposed, the sentence imposed by Judge Woods is nonetheless relevant for consideration. (AB 290)
35Once again, subjective matters were not raised by the applicant as an issue in his parity argument.  However, it should be noted that Henry had no relevant previous convictions.
36Tupman DCJ resolved that a sentence of imprisonment of 11 years was called for.  She referred to the prevailing assumption of a non-parole period of 60 to 66 per cent of the total term for Commonwealth offences (see however Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 532-534, [36]-[44]).  Her Honour determined that the non-parole period would be 7 years which was ""a little less than sixty-six per cent, having chosen to do that to reflect the fact that he is serving his term of custody away from family and friends and thus somewhat more onerously than otherwise"" (AB 295).
Argument on the application
37The following points were raised in the written submissions by Mr James QC on behalf of the applicant in written submissions and some were further developed in oral submissions:
(a) When imposing the non-parole period the judge did not take into account parity (AWS [6] and [10]).
(b)  The non-parole period did not show any relativity or parity to that imposed on Henry.  Henry's non-parole period of 7 years is 3 years shorter than the applicant's notwithstanding the relative roles and, apart from the applicant's onerous conditions of custody, her Honour ""appeared to find"" that other considerations were ""on a par"" (AWS [10]).
(c) The applicant's non-parole period does not reflect parity with the sentencing of Alchikh who received a non-parole period of 7 years 3 months against a total term of 12 years (AWS [11]). 
(d) The charges against the applicant and Alchikh on the one hand and Henry on the other were not significantly different (AWS [12]).
(e) There was an ""inexplicable difference in relative non-parole periods without express explanation"" (AWS [13]).
(f) ""The difference between the Henry head sentence and [the applicant's] head sentence was 10% (18 years v 20 years) therefore it would be objectively expected, all other things being roughly equal, the difference in non-parole periods should be approximately the same, 10% i.e. King should have received a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months to 8 years which would properly make allowance for the onerous nature of his imprisonment as that applies particularly to the non-parole period applying the principles in Hill v The Queen and Jones v The Queen [sic].""  (AWS [13])
(g) Although her Honour did not expressly refer to a non-parole period usually being 60 per cent to 66 per cent of the total term it appears that this is what has occurred and in consequence the parity principle has been infringed.  (AWS [13])
38An alternative submission was that ""the non-parole period is manifestly excessive"".  I take it to mean that it is excessive, according to the parity principle, when compared to the non-parole periods imposed upon Henry and Alchikh but not otherwise.  If that understanding is incorrect, I am nevertheless of the view that, as against a head sentence of 16 years (which was not challenged in the written or oral submissions), a non-parole period of 10 years for a principal offender in the importation of prohibited drugs in the quantity involved here is in no way ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"":  Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [25].  I record that I am of the same view in relation to the head sentence.
The proposed appeal has no merit
39It is significant that the sentencing judge was alive to the parity principle.  Not only did she pay regard to the judgments on sentence in relation to six co-offenders, she was the sentencing judge in respect of one of the two in question.  It is apparent from the lengthy quotation from her sentencing remarks set out earlier (at [27]) that careful attention was given to the need to impose a sentence which was just, having regard to the sentences imposed on the others.  There is no merit in the applicant's first point (above at [37] (a)).
40The second point (above at [37] (b)) ignores the fact that Henry was sentenced for a different and less serious offence to that for which the applicant was sentenced.  It was an aiding and abetting offence over a period of 5 days as opposed to a conspiracy over a period of almost 5 months.  For those reasons alone it is incorrect to say, in my view, that the charges were ""not significantly different"" (above at [37] (d)).  Further, the activity in which the applicant was involved in during that longer period was clearly more extensive and at a higher level in the importation syndicate in comparison to Henry's activity.
41The written submissions for the applicant seem to assume that there should be a close similarity of non-parole periods for offenders who received total sentences of 16 years (in the applicant's case), 12 years (Alchikh) and 11 years (Henry).  The respective non-parole periods were fairly equivalent as a percentage of the total terms (60 to 66 per cent).  Why they should have been fairly equivalent in duration despite the significantly longer head sentence imposed upon the applicant was not explained aside from the point which follows.
42The argument founded upon Henry's sentence being 18 years, and thus only 10 per cent less than the applicant's, is wrong.  18 years was the starting point that Woods DCJ had adopted in formulating the sentence in respect of a conviction that was quashed.  20 years was the starting point adopted for the applicant's sentence.  What is relevant is that Henry's sentence was 11 years and the applicant's was 16 years.
43Aside from that aspect, the premise underlying Mr James' submission seems to be:  If the starting point for the sentence imposed upon offender A is X per cent higher than that for offender B, then the non-parole period for offender A should be only X per cent higher than B's non-parole period.
44There was no quantification of the amount of reduction of Henry's sentence on account of his plea; the judge referred to it as showing a belated willingness to facilitate the course of justice so for present purposes it might be assumed that the sentence would otherwise have been about 13 years.  If the premise underlying the submission is valid, then against Henry's non-parole period of 7 years 3 months, the applicant's non-parole period should have been just over 11 years.
45The final point advanced by the applicant was that her Honour felt bound by the previously approved ""norm"" of a non-parole period being 60 to 66 per cent of the total term for Commonwealth offences.  There is no basis for this submission.  The submissions to her Honour by the Crown made specific reference to Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen (AB 33).  Her statement that ""the non-parole period should reflect the minimum period of time which justice requires that he serve to reflect all of the circumstances of the offence"" was, in fact, the precise words used in the statement of principle by the plurality in Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 629.  This principle was subsequently affirmed in Deakin v The Queen [1984] HCA 31; (1984) 58 ALJR 367 at 367, Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 531, and, of course, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen at 533 [40].
Conclusions
46Contrary to the submissions for the applicant, there is nothing in what her Honour Judge Tupman said (or did not say) that would suggest she adopted a mechanistic or formulaic approach, or that she considered herself bound to fix a non-parole period which bore any particular relationship to the total term of the sentence.
47I cannot discern any error in the manner in which the sentencing discretion was exercised.  There was a correct application of sentencing principles and all relevant matters were taken into account in setting both the total term and the non-parole period.  This included the need, of which her Honour was conscious, to set appropriate terms relative to the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders.  
48If the applicant harbours any grievance concerning any aspect of the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders, it is not an objectively justifiable one.
49As the proposed appeal was completely lacking in merit I agreed that leave should be refused.

2759946,SUNADA v R; JARU v R [2012] NSWCCA 187,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  Mr Ilham Sunada and Mr Basir Jaru, the appellants, appeal against their conviction of offences under s 232A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), charged in the Indictment as follows:
""Between about 29 January 2010 and about 4 February 2010 in and between the waters between the Republic of Indonesia and the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Australia, [Mr Sunada and Mr Jaru] facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people, namely a group of eighty four people who were non-citizens and travelled to Australia without visas that were in effect, and they did so reckless as to whether those people had a lawful right to come to Australia"".
2The now-repealed s 232A(1) was in the following terms:
""(1) A person who:
(a) organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of 5 or more people to whom subsection 42(1) applies; and
(b) does so reckless as to whether the people had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia;
is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction, by imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both"".
3At the appellants' trial in the District Court, the trial judge on two occasions directed the jury to the following effect:
""It is enough if the Crown can prove that the accused knew that they were coming to Ashmore Reef, however called.  The Crown does not have to prove that they knew that it was part of Australia"" (Summing-Up pp 12 and 17).
4At the conclusion of the Summing-Up, counsel for Mr Sunada submitted to the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, that this direction was erroneous.  His Honour declined to alter his direction.
5In their grounds of appeal against conviction filed on 3 May 2012, the appellants contended that the trial judge's direction was erroneous.  On 29 June 2012 the Victorian Supreme Court delivered judgment in PJ v R [2012] VSCA 146, holding that proof of an offence under s 233C of the Migration Act requires proof that the accused intended that relevant persons be brought to a destination that was a part of Australia and that the accused knew was a part of Australia ([5] and [44]).  Section 233C was inserted into the Migration Act on 1 June 2010, at the time that s 232A was repealed.  Section 233C(1) relevantly provides as follows:
""(1) A person (the first person) commits an offence if:
(a) the first person organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of at least 5 persons (the other persons); and
(b) at least 5 of the other persons are non-citizens; and
(c) the persons referred to in paragraph (b) who are non-citizens had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia"".
6There are differences between the repealed s 232A and the current 233C but the Crown submits that there is no presently relevant distinction.  Indeed, in light of the decision in PJ v R, the Crown submits that the direction given here by the trial judge was erroneous, and significant.  It does not submit that despite the misdirection, no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred.  As a result, it submits that the appellants' appeals should be upheld and their convictions quashed.  
7As the Crown has pointed out, this Court should follow PJ v R, being a decision of another Australian intermediate appellate court on materially identical Commonwealth legislation, unless it is convinced that the decision is plainly wrong (Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492; Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 at [134]).  The Crown does not submit that PJ v R is wrong.  Indeed it accepts its correctness.  PJ v R is a carefully reasoned decision dealing comprehensively with issues arising out of legislation which, for present purposes, we regard as materially indistinguishable.  As we do not consider the decision to be plainly wrong, we propose to follow it and quash the appellants' convictions.
8The Crown submits that an order for a re-trial would not be appropriate and that this Court should enter verdicts of acquittal in favour of the appellants.  It points particularly to the fact that the appellants have already served a large proportion of their sentences.  On 27 September 2011 the appellants were sentenced to five year terms of imprisonment, with three year non-parole periods, both periods to date from 4 February 2010, when the appellants were taken into custody.  As they remain in custody, they have completed almost two years and seven months of their three year non-parole periods.  Some time would inevitably elapse before a re-trial took place and the Crown has advanced no reason why, if the appellants were convicted at that trial, their sentences would be any longer than those imposed at the first trial.  Assuming they remained in custody pending a re-trial, before their re-trial occurred they would serve considerably more time in prison than the non-parole periods imposed on 27 September 2011. 
9This is a compelling reason to accept the Crown's submission that a re-trial should not be ordered.  Accordingly, verdicts of acquittal should be entered.
10The orders that the Court makes are that the convictions of the appellants of offences under s 232A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 at the trial concluding on 23 September 2011 be quashed and that verdicts of acquittal of the appellants be entered in relation to the charges of those offences.

		28 August 2012",2012-08-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759953,R v HE R v SE [2012] NSWSC 1024,"SENTENCE

1The offenders, HE and SE, who are brothers, each stand for sentence on one count of affray pursuant to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Each of the offenders pleaded guilty to the offence on 10 February 2012 after the Crown accepted that it did not have a case against them on a charge of murder, for which the offenders were to stand trial, along with others, commencing 30 January 2012.

2The agreed statement of facts is identical in each case. Each of the offenders acknowledged the basis upon which they would be sentenced by signing a copy of that statement of facts.

3On 25 June 2009 at approximately 9 pm there was an incident at the Bankstown Centro shopping centre involving two groups of young men who were broadly aligned with the offenders family, on the one hand, and the Mariam family, on the other. The incident involved minor violence and some threats. Police and security officers ejected both groups from the centre. The members of the two groups then engaged in a series of phone calls, in the course of which various friends and relatives were ""recruited"" to meet later that night to settle the dispute. In the course of the phone calls, expressions such as ""punching on"" and ""I'm going to smash you"" were used, although not by either of the offenders.

4The offenders' older brother contacted the owner of a white van who drove to the offenders' residence where the older brother entered the front seat. The two offenders entered the rear of the van. The offenders' older brother told the owner of the van that his brothers would be dropped off at a friend's house. However that did not occur. At the time of these events HE was 16 years of age and SE was 15 years of age.

5The van drove to another house in Yagoona where two further males entered the van. After the driver of the van asked what was going on and was told that they were going to ""punch on"" in a park in Revesby, the driver of the van asked to be taken back to his house. At this point in time one of the occupants of the van saw that the offenders' older brother had a handgun in his possession. There is no evidence that this gun was fired in the course of the evening.

6Further telephone calls were made between the offenders' older brother and members of the Mariam group. Eventually the agreement was to meet in the car park of the KFC in Milperra. Before going to the car park the occupants of the van picked up a cousin of the offenders, who brought with him a rifle covered in a sheet. At some stage the rifle was shown to other members of the group in the rear of the van. Someone stated that it was purely to frighten the opposition. Whilst the offenders saw the rifle, they did not know that the rifle was loaded.

7When the van pulled up at the car park at about 10:25 pm the members of the Mariam group were already present. The two offenders left the van and moved towards the other group. The offenders' older brother left the van and ran to a Honda containing members of the Mariam group and started fighting with one of them. Other occupants of the van emerged carrying a length of wood and a spanner type object. These were used to do extensive damage to the Honda. The offenders intended to participate in the affray.

8A member of the Mariam group began shooting at the offenders' group. The offenders themselves immediately took cover. Another occupant of the van took the rifle from the van and began to return fire. Very shortly thereafter the offenders and other members of the group retreated to the van and left the carpark.

9As the result of the discharge of a firearm by a member of the Mariam group, a truck driver, Robert Knight, was struck by a bullet and killed as he drove his truck down Milperra Road approximately 200 m from the car park. 

10Two members of the Mariam group were also injured by the discharge of firearms, one seriously. That participant, Rami Abdulhardi, was sentenced on 27 April 2012 for his role in the affray. 

11Mr Abdulhardi pleaded guilty to the affray some two weeks after the offenders entered their pleas. His role was of a limited nature in that he was not armed, he did not directly engage in any violence, and he was shot almost as soon as the affray commenced. In addition, Mr Abdulhardi was sentenced as an adult offender. He received a sentence of 3 years and 7 months, including a non parole period of 2 years.

12The immediate question that arises is whether the offenders ought be dealt with according to law or pursuant to Division 4 of Part 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. If not dealt with according to law, the available penalties are those that apply to the Children's Court jurisdiction. The decision under s 18(1) of the Act must be made having regard to the seriousness of the indictable offence concerned, the nature of the indictable offence concerned, the age and maturity of the person at the time of the offence and at the time of sentencing, the seriousness, nature and number of any prior offences committed by the person, and such other matters as the court considers relevant. 

13Neither of the offenders have any prior criminal history. Notwithstanding that fact and their respective ages and level of maturity at the time of the offence, I am of the view that they must be dealt with according to law. The principal factors in that determination are the gravity of the offence and the fact that affray represents a most serious breach of public order. The objective seriousness of the offence deserves close consideration, for these purposes and for the purposes of the sentencing exercise generally.

14When sentencing Mr Abdulhardi, I said :-

One only has to relate the circumstances surrounding the commission of the affray to appreciate its objective gravity. The level of violence meted out in the course of these events and the premeditated assembly of 11 young men in a public place, adjacent to a major arterial road in western Sydney, at about 10:30pm on a week night, for the sole purpose of settling a score that seems to have arisen during a petty assault earlier that day, marks this affray as a particularly serious example of the offence. 

Notwithstanding that the events outlined above took place over a relatively short period of time (including the discharge of firearms over a matter of minutes), it bore all the hallmarks of a complete disregard for, indeed a contempt for, the rule of law. It was an abhorrent and despicable display of male aggression. 

15I adopt these remarks and would only add the following. There was considerable debate during the sentencing hearing about the extent to which the Court could have regard to the fact that the discharge of firearms resulted in the death of an innocent bystander in assessing the gravity of the offence. That is an issue that has been considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in similar cases. 

16Most relevantly, in Stevens v R [2007] NSWCCA 152, Price J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing) said at [25] to [27] :-
In determining an appropriate sentence for an offence of affray contrary to section 93C of the Crimes Act an offender's conduct is to be considered in the context of the conduct of a co-offender. The level of violence used and the scale of the affray is relevant. An offender however, may only be sentenced for that part of his conduct and the conduct of the co-offender which give rise to the offence of affray and not that conduct which resulted in some other offence being committed by him or by the co-offender; see R v Huynh [2000] NSWCCA 18; R v Eleter [2003] NSWCCA 130 and R v Fajka [2004] NSWCCA 166.
His Honour found as I have mentioned that the applicant and Davis were the aggressors. Furthermore it was open to the judge to find that they had attacked both victims with extreme violence. The attack by Davies upon Mrs Herring with a tyre lever was part of the co-offender's conduct which gave rise to the offence of affray. In my view, the nature and extent of the physical violence was an objective factor relevant to the seriousness of the offence.

17Most recently in Khanwaiz & Ors v R [2012] NSWCCA 168 , Beech-Jones J said (Basten JA and Harrison J agreeing) :-

50. Further the significance of the distinct element of the affray charge, namely the effect of the attack upon persons at the scene, cannot be understated. Offences such as s 93C have a wider focus that just the impact on the direct victim of the unlawful violence. Section 93C is located within Part 3A of the Crimes Act which deals with public order. Attacks of the kind participated in by Noman can undermine the public's confidence in the security of their streets and homes. His Honour recognised this is in the sentencing judgment when referring to the ""separate policy considerations effectively requiring separate assessments of the criminality and issues of accumulation"" with the affray offences.

18It is axiomatic that in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the offenders for the affray, they are not to be punished for the manslaughter of Mr Knight. By the acceptance of the pleas to the affray, and the agreed statement of facts, the Crown acknowledged that neither of the offenders actually inflicted any violence or were aware of the presence of loaded firearms, which would have brought with it their acknowledgement of the possibility of the discharge of those firearms and the death of another person. 

19In other words, they stand to be sentenced on the basis of their individual and relatively minor roles in the commission of the offence. That, however, does not preclude the Court from taking into account, for the purposes of assessing the objective gravity of the offence, the fact that the discharge of loaded firearms was a feature of the affray. That feature of the offence demonstrated the extent to which members of the public were put in fear for their personal safety.

20This analysis brings me to another controversy during the sentencing proceedings. The offenders' counsel objected to the reception by the Court of a victim impact statement from Mr Knight's daughter, on the basis that it did not meet the definition of a statement relating to a ""primary victim"" of the offence of affray. The statement was not read. It was received provisionally pending the resolution of the objection.

21This issue is governed by s 26 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It defines a victim impact statement as :-

a statement containing particulars of: 
(a) in the case of a primary victim, any personal harm suffered by the victim as a direct result of the offence, or 
(b) in the case of a family victim, the impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family. 

22""Primary victim"" is relevantly defined as a person against whom the offence was committed. ""Family victim"" is defined as :-
in relation to an offence as a direct result of which a primary victim has died, .... a person who was, at the time the offence was committed, a member of the primary victim's immediate family, and includes such a person whether or not the person has suffered personal harm as a result of the offence.

23It is therefore abundantly clear that Mr Knight was not a person against whom the affray was committed. It cannot be said that his death was a direct result of the affray, in the sense that these participants envisaged that the discharge of firearms was likely or probable. Strictly construed, the statement by Mr Knight's daughter is not receivable by the Court for the purposes of sentencing these offenders. 

24Returning to the objective gravity of the offence, the Crown submitted that this affray was ""towards the worst case"", including as it did a measure of planning and premeditation, the fact that the participants were variously armed with firearms, pieces of timber and spanners, that it was a large group, that it occurred in full view of numerous members of the public in a public car park and that it involved the actual use of violence. The Crown further submits that the offence calls for a sentence towards the upper range for offences of this kind.

25I have previously commented in the course of sentencing Mr Abdulhardi that the range of sentences imposed for this offence have not perceptibly changed since the maximum penalty was doubled in December 2005. For the same reasons that I articulated on the previous occasion, the offenders nonetheless have a legitimate expectation that they will receive sentences in accordance with the existing sentencing practice. 

26To the extent that the gravity of the offence is affected by its short duration and the fact that it occurred late at night, after the various retail outlets on the perimeter of the car park had closed, those factors are of some, albeit, limited significance. The relatively short period of time during which the affray took place, in the order of minutes, was no doubt the product of the repeated discharge of at least two firearms and the wounding that resulted to two of the Mariam group. The participants in the affray were in exposed positions in the car park. The longer they remained there, the more likely it was that they themselves would be injured. Notwithstanding that the fast food outlets were no longer trading, there were members of the staff of those outlets who were waiting in the car park to be collected by friends and relatives. Moreover, adjacent to the car park, there was a service station and 711 store which was, at the time of the affray, trading with members of the public. All of these people were potentially put at risk of serious injury. That risk materialised in the death of Mr Knight.

27In the result, it is not necessary to embrace the Crown's description of the offence as one approaching the worst case. It is always possible to envisage circumstances that would render the offence more objectively serious, although that does not preclude a finding that an offence is in the worst case category. This affray did not take place at a time or in a place that engendered in a large number of members of the public fear for their personal safety. That does not detract from my assessment of the offence as objectively a particularly serious example of affray.

28The nature and gravity of the offence would, in the case of adult offenders, elevate general deterrence in the sentencing exercise. However, the principles established by the common law and s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act are capable of ameliorating that factor. The extent of that amelioration depends in part upon the degree to which the offenders' realised that what they were embarking upon when they arrived at the carpark was a most serious offence. The other considerations prescribed by s 6 are nonetheless relevant to the sentencing exercise in each case.

29I turn to a consideration of HE's role in the offence and his subjective circumstances. 

30The offender did not give evidence and what information there is disclosing his comprehension of the events of that night is contained in a Juvenile Justice report (Exhibit D). It is said that on the afternoon of the offence, he was at home with his younger brother SE when his eldest brother, HEK, informed him of the incident at Bankstown with another group of boys. HEK told the offender that he was going to meet up with this group at a park in Revesby. The offender agreed to go with his brother on the understanding that they were to discuss the problem. However, the offender acknowledged that if a fight broke out, he was prepared to participate in it. The offender expressly disavowed any coercion brought to bear by his older brother.

31The offender stated that he did not participate in any of the conversations in the van and that he was not aware at any time that there were guns in the van. The offender left the van in the carpark with others and commenced to walk towards the opposing group with the intention of participating in the affray. As soon as he heard gunshots, he took cover.

32The offender only became aware of the death of Mr Knight a few days later when he was watching television. He reported that this came as a shock to him and that he was affected by TV coverage of the family grieving for the death of Mr Knight. The offender told the Juvenile Justice officer that he regularly thinks about Mr Knight and the impact of his death on his family.

33No doubt, the offender's level of maturity exposed him to a degree of influence from his older brother. In addition, there was a degree of stress within the family owing to the serious illness of the youngest child with leukaemia between 2007 and 2009. The offender's father and mother spent days at a time at hospital, leaving their other children at home without support and guidance. It is perhaps understandable that in those circumstances, the offender's older brother assumed a greater degree of authority. 

34However, this offender is not without intelligence. He is described by his principal at Condell Park high school as ""an outstanding student"". He was considered a candidate for tertiary education, was well liked by his peers and teachers and was always polite. It is therefore puzzling, given that his prospects were promising and he was largely ignorant of his older brother's peers, that he would consciously involve himself in an event that he knew could turn violent.

35Having regard to these matters, the need for the penalty to reflect general deterrence is somewhat attenuated. Moreover, the offender's acknowledgement to the Juvenile Justice officer that he takes responsibility for the offence and that he recognizes its gravity augurs well for his rehabilitation and demonstrate a level of maturity that was obviously lacking at the time of the commission of the offence. The offender returned to school to complete the HSC on his release to bail on 2 September 2010, and secured employment in a roofing company thereafter. He is currently scheduled to commence tertiary studies at the University of Western Sydney. These are powerful indications that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are promising and that the interests of the community in ensuring that he continues with a law-abiding life may be better served by the imposition of a sentence that allows those aims to be realised. Specific deterrence plays no role in sentencing this offender.

36The Crown maintained in its submissions that that the offender exhibited no remorse for the offence. I am satisfied from the contents of the Juvenile Justice report that the offender demonstrates a capacity to empathise with the family of Mr Knight. The absence of any clear statement of remorse, whether on oath or of a hearsay nature, is explicable by the offender's repeated denial of knowledge of the presence of guns. In that respect, he maintains he is not responsible for the death of Mr Knight, a fact that is established by his plea to affray. His remorse for his involvement in the affray itself was interpreted by the Juvenile Justice officer from the offender's comments, rather than by any direct statement of remorse.

37The last matter that ought to be addressed relates to the admission by the legal representatives of this offender and his brother SE in the course of a bail application on 2 September 2010 of the offenders' involvement in the affray. It is submitted that such an acknowledgement of guilt ought to result in the application of the maximum discount for the plea of guilty. Whatever instructions were given to the offenders' legal representatives approximately 14 months after the commission of the offence, the fact remains that no plea of guilty was entered until the commencement of the trial. The statement by the Court in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 in relation to the principles applicable to the assessment of a discount for the plea of guilty does not accommodate the submission in this case.

38In any event, in the view that I have formed as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed, this is not a matter that requires resolution.

39I turn to the subjective circumstances of SE and his appreciation of the role he played in the commission of the offence.

40This offender gave no evidence in the course of the proceedings. Once again, what little information there is in relation to his appreciation of the gravity of the offence is to be derived from a Juvenile Justice report which is Exhibit E.

41It is said that this offender was aware that his older brother had a dispute with another young person on the day of the offence. He was aware that his brother, HEK, and the young person arranged to meet to sort out the disagreement. The offender agreed to go with his brother to act as support. He agreed that he was prepared to engage in a physical fight if the need arose.

42The offender reported that he was unaware of any of the discussion that occurred whilst he was in the van and he denied seeing or being aware of any firearms in the van. On arrival at the carpark, he left the van with a piece of wood and approached the occupants of the Honda. He reported that he intended to scare them with the piece of wood and that he had no intention of using it as a weapon. He admits that he was willing to engage in a physical altercation if that was necessary to assist his brother. He immediately returned to the van as soon as shots were fired.

43When discussing the offence with the officer, the offender stated he wished that he had not been involved. He accepted that he had made a poor decision, that he was immature at the time and did not comprehend or consider the consequences of his actions. His young age and the factors that bore upon his decision to participate in the offence lessen to some extent the emphasis on general deterrence. Nonetheless, on his own admission, his role in the offence was more active than that of HE, in that he armed himself with an implement capable of causing injury.

44The offender also reported his sorrow for Mr Knight and his family. He said that he had experienced nightmares arising out of the incident. According to the Juvenile Justice officer, this offender was visibly upset during this discussion. The offender also expressed regret for the additional stress that he had visited upon his family.

45I need not repeat the observations that I have made above in relation to the impact of the stressful conditions then applying in the offender's family. This offender was one year younger than HE during the period of his younger brother's illness. Moreover, his educational history was not so promising, in that he experienced difficulties during the early years of his secondary schooling. He was suspended on several occasions for aggressive behaviour towards the students, intimidating behaviour towards teachers and refusal to follow directions. These problems resolved to the extent that the offender was able to complete his year 10 certificate at Condell Park high school.

46After leaving school the offender obtained an apprenticeship as a carpenter and remained there until he was arrested on 21 April 2010. On his release to bail on 2 September 2010 he worked in various places before obtaining employment installing aluminium doors and windows in January 2011. He remains employed in that role. He has enrolled at TAFE to undertake further study in his adopted trade.

47The offender's maturation since the commission of the offence no doubt improves his prospects of rehabilitation. His present employment and his acknowledgement of responsibility for engaging in a violent altercation suggest that he is capable of adopting and maintaining a constructive crime free life. It must be acknowledged that, like his older brother HE, his remorse for the offence is qualified. Specific deterrence is not a factor that needs to be addressed.

48I see no reason to distinguish between the offenders in terms of penalty, despite the slightly higher criminality exhibited by SE in the commission of the offence. That circumstance is offset to some extent by SE's relative immaturity. In all other respects, the offenders stand in the same position. They have each served a period of 16 months on remand and have been subject to strict bail conditions for a period of two years.

49Taking all of these matters into account, I propose to sentence as follows :-

50HE, you are convicted of the offence of affray. I direct that you enter a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of three years, to date from today, expiring 29 August 2015, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. You must appear before the court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond, and you must be of good behaviour for the duration of the bond.

51SE, you are convicted of the offence of affray. I direct that you enter a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of three years, to date from today, expiring 29 August 2015, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. You must appear before the court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond, and you must be of good behaviour for the duration of the bond.

		12 November 2012",2012-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2759954,R v Mahmoud Mariam [2012] NSWSC 1023,"SENTENCE

1The offender, Mahmoud Mariam, stands for sentence on a charge of manslaughter and a charge of affray following verdicts of guilty on 28 May 2012. The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The offence of affray carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.

2The following represents a summary of the events giving rise to the offences that were the subject of a three-month trial.

3At about 9pm on 25 June 2009, a juvenile male (HEK) was involved in a physical assault with another young man at Bankstown's Centro shopping centre. Adam Mariam, the offender's younger brother, was also present as a friend of the young man who was assaulted. The assault was interrupted by security staff and by police. Both groups of young men were escorted from the premises. HEK was unsatisfied with the outcome of the confrontation.

4Over the following hour, numerous telephone calls were made between associates and family members of the two opposing camps, namely the Mariam group and HEK's group, as well as between members belonging to each group. During these telephone calls, arrangements were made to meet in order to pursue the earlier conflict. During these calls, members of each group recruited other people to participate in the planned confrontation. This offender volunteered his services in response to his younger brother's complaints about his friend's treatment at the hands of HEK. 

5At about 10:15pm, three members of the Mariam group, including this offender and Rami Abdulhardi, travelled to the vicinity of the car park in a Mazda. This offender was armed with a loaded Ruger pistol. They parked near a roundabout on Starkey Drive and walked from the vehicle into the car park adjacent to a Hungry Jack's food outlet. The trio was seen by a number of employees of that outlet. They changed direction and walked towards the Aldi store on the northern edge of the car park. They remained in view of the Hungry Jack's employees until those employees left the parking lot shortly thereafter.

6Shortly afterwards, a Honda car occupied by the offender's two younger brothers, pulled into the car park and parked between KFC and Hungry Jack's. Those persons remained in the car.

7A short time later, at about 10:25pm, a white van carrying HEK's group entered the car park and parked alongside the Honda. At this point in time, the high beam of the Honda was activated, whereupon this offender and Mr Abdulhardi started walking towards the white van.

8Almost immediately, the offender began shooting at the opposing group. He repeatedly discharged his firearm in a generally southerly direction. As many as 10 cartridges were fired indiscriminately in a matter of minutes. One of them travelled across the carpark, through a border of foliage and trees, across Milperra road, ultimately striking a truck driver, Mr Knight in the right side of the head, killing him instantly. Another projectile appears to have injured the offender's younger brother, who was shot in the arm adjacent to the Honda. Mr Abdulhardi received gunshot wounds to the stomach, most probably from the return of fire by Adel Elkobaili, who had emerged from the van. Other occupants of the van, who had commenced to assault the occupants of the Honda before they realised they were under fire, took cover.

9Very shortly after these events, the van left the scene. The offender initially went to the assistance of his brother, who was taken to hospital. Mr Abdulhardi was left lying on the ground in the carpark where the police found him a short time later. The offender fled the scene at high speed, pursued by two police vehicles. It was the Crown case, which the jury accepted, that he threw the Ruger from the car as it sped away. The gun was later recovered with an empty magazine. Ultimately, the offender was arrested at his home and remained in custody until 14 July 2009 when he was released to bail. He re-entered custody on 15 February 2010 following the imposition of a three month term for a driving offence. That term expired on 14 May 2010. 

10It is relevant to note that the jury acquitted Adel Elkobaili of all offences, including affray, and that the only way in which those verdicts can be reconciled with the guilty verdicts returned against this offender is on the basis that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Adel Elkobaili was not acting in self-defence. The corollary of that proposition is that the jury found as a fact that Mahmoud Mariam was the first to discharge a firearm. That finding appears to me to be consistent with an acceptance by the jury that the combined actions of the Mariam group constituted a form of ambush, to which Adel Elkobaili responded. The offender, through his counsel, accepts that he is to be sentenced on the basis that he was responsible for the death of Mr Knight by the unlawful and dangerous discharge of the pistol in the circumstances I have outlined.

11The objective gravity of the manslaughter is, in my view, high. The Crown submission that the offence involved the deliberate and repeated firing of a firearm in a public place with a view to furthering a conflict between two groups of young men in which the offender played no part is well founded. This was not a manslaughter that arose in circumstances where a physical altercation results in the unintentional death of one of the participants. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender took the loaded firearm with the intention of using it, albeit not necessarily with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death on any person. The fact remains however, that all of the offender's actions on the night in question were demonstrative of a premeditated plan to surprise the members of the opposing group with a pre-emptive show of force.

12In these circumstances, there is very little additional criminality represented by the commission of the affray. I recognize that the affray brings with it the additional element of placing members of the public in fear for their personal safety. As I observed when sentencing Mr Abdulhardi, one only has to relate the circumstances surrounding the commission of the affray to appreciate its objective gravity. The level of violence meted out in the course of these events and the premeditated assembly of 11 young men in a public place, adjacent to a major arterial road in western Sydney, at about 10:30pm on a week night, for the sole purpose of settling a score that seems to have arisen during a petty assault earlier that day, marks this affray as a particularly serious example of the offence. 

13Notwithstanding that the events outlined above took place over a relatively short period of time (including the discharge of firearms over a matter of minutes), it bore all the hallmarks of a complete disregard for, indeed a contempt for, the rule of law. It was an abhorrent and despicable display of male aggression. That said, any appreciable accumulation of the sentence for the affray on the sentence for the manslaughter risks an element of double punishment.

14The Court acknowledges the very moving and profound expression of grief expressed by Mr Knight's son and daughter at the senseless death of a treasured father, grandfather and husband. It is understandable that they desire punishment of a far greater order than it is within the power and discretion of the Court to impose. Despite an eloquent and heartfelt expression of condolence on the part of the offender's counsel during the sentencing proceedings, it remains true to say that the offender himself has at no stage expressed the slightest remorse for the death of Mr Knight. He chose to place evidence of his personal circumstances before the Court in the form of an affidavit, as was his right, yet nowhere did he address the consequences of his offending, other than the impact it had on himself and his family.

15The offender offered through his then legal representatives on 16 May 2011 a plea to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. That offer was rejected by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The offender's legal representatives at trial made a further offer on 20 February 2012 to plead to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. That offer was also rejected by the Director. In those circumstances, notwithstanding the offender's vigorous defence at trial, he is entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed for the manslaughter in accordance with the principles established in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 and R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129. I would assess the discount at 15%.

16The offender will turn 29 on 14 September 2012. His parents came to Australia from Lebanon in 1978. The offender's father has owned and operated a car repair business in Bankstown for the past 24 years. His mother also works in the family business from time to time. The offender has four brothers, one older, and three younger.

17The offender undertook secondary schooling at the Sydney Adventist College in Strathfield. He completed his HSC in 2001. He married his wife on 10 September 2004. They have two children, aged six and two. The offender commenced working with his father in the panel beating business in late 2004. In 2009 they purchased a property from the offender's father in which they lived. The offender's wife sold the family home after the offender was taken into custody. The offender's wife and his two children currently live in rented accommodation in Bankstown.

18The offender's wife provided a letter to the Court (Exhibit 4) which outlines the hardship and depression she has suffered since her husband went into custody. It was not submitted that her hardship, such as it is, qualifies as exceptional circumstances for the purposes of mitigating the sentence that is otherwise appropriate to the objective and subjective criminality.

19The offender has undertaken an apprenticeship through TAFE in automotive panel beating. The offender also undertook a part-time course in business management at TAFE and a travel agency course. On his release, the offender has available to him full-time employment in his father's business. He has expressed a wish to undertake employment in the travel and tourism industry.

20The offender's criminal history consists of two counts of robbery in company in 2001, for which the offender received a community service order and a two-year bond. He was called up in relation to a breach of the bond in June 2003. He received a 12 month suspended sentence of imprisonment. In 2009 he came before the court for an offence of drive vehicle recklessly or furiously or speed/manner dangerous. He initially received a sentence of six months imprisonment which was reduced on appeal to a sentence of three months imprisonment. Those driving offences were referable to the offender's flight from the scene and his pursuit by police after the commission of the instant offence.

21The circumstances of these offences demand considerable emphasis on the principle of general deterrence. Specific deterrence also has some limited significance, in view of the offender's criminal history and the absence of any evidence of his capacity for insight into his behaviour. To my observation, he wears his contempt for the law as a badge of honour. I therefore regard his prospects of rehabilitation as moderate at best. The aggregate punishment to be imposed for the offences of manslaughter and affray must, in my view, reflect the fact that the offender was a mature adult who consciously and arrogantly engaged in the most mindless display of violence in the presence of a number of much younger men and vulnerable members of the public. I see no sound basis for a finding of special circumstances.

22In all of these circumstances, and taking into account the 19 days the offender was bail refused on these offences, I propose to sentence the offender as follows :-

23Mahmoud Mariam, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non parole period of 5 years and 9 months, to date from 24 July 2010, expiring 23 April 2016, with an additional term of 2 years, expiring 23 April 2018.

24You are further convicted of the offence of affray. I sentence you to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment, to date from 24 April 2010, expiring 23 April 2013. 

25You are eligible for release on 24 April 2016.

2759958,R v Seymour [2012] NSWSC 1010,"Remarks on Sentence 

1HIS HONOUR: Krystal Jade Seymour has been found guilty by a jury of the manslaughter of her mother, Donna Marie Seymour on 24 November 2010. The jury acquitted her of the deceased's murder. 

2The offender stabbed the deceased once with a kitchen knife in the back of the left upper arm, severing the brachial artery which is a major blood vessel. The deceased died from blood loss due to the stab wound. The deceased was 48 years old at the time of her death.

3The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. 

4It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. 

5Although the jury was directed that a verdict of manslaughter was available if the Crown was unable to exclude the reasonable possibility that the offender killed the deceased under provocation, or that a verdict of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act was open in the event that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, I am satisfied that the verdict of manslaughter was returned because the Crown was unable to exclude the reasonable possibility that the offender personally believed her conduct was necessary to defend herself. However, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing of the deceased was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as the offender perceived them to be. Accordingly, the offender is to be sentenced upon the basis that her liability for manslaughter arises because her conduct amounted to excessive self defence. Both Mr Crown and Mr Smith, the offender's counsel, do not suggest otherwise. 

6The offender had been living with her two year old son in the deceased's home at Girraween. She had been out with friends and the deceased had been at home looking after the child. The offender returned to the home in the early hours of the morning on 24 November 2010. The offence was committed shortly before 3.45am. 

7In order to make findings of fact that are consistent with the jury's verdict, it is necessary to recite very briefly some of the evidence in the trial and to refer to submissions made by counsel. 

8Mr Smith contended that the offender's relationship with the deceased was turbulent. He invited me to find that the deceased was verbally abusive towards the offender and at times physically violent towards her. 

9Brooke Seymour, one of the deceased's daughters, gave evidence that in 2010 the deceased had attacked the offender who was holding her son. Miss Seymour said the deceased scratched, punched and slapped the offender after an argument had taken place in the lounge room and kitchen of the home. 

10David Johnson told the jury that he had seen the deceased kicking the offender around her middle section, when the offender was about 14 or 15 years old. Mr Johnson testified that the offender telephoned him in about April 2010, telling him that she had been arguing with her mother and that she wanted to travel to Queensland. He heard a smacking sound and no one talked on the telephone for a few minutes, but he heard two women arguing. The offender picked up the phone and said that she wanted to go to Queensland but her mother did not want her to come. Mr Johnson heard a voice in the background saying ""You're going nowhere."" The offender rang back the following day, telling him that her mother had hit her child who was in her arms and had thrown her out of the house. Mr Johnson saw the offender at the Formule 1 hotel and observed that she had a bruise on her face and was cuddling the child. 

11Mr Crown was critical of Mr Johnson's evidence and contended that he was not a reliable witness. Although Mr Johnson was a colourful character, I did not find him to be dishonest or unreliable. His evidence was in part supported by the photos (trial ex 1) and the hotel receipt dated 8 April 2010 in the offender's name (trial ex 2). 

12Jason Jonathon gave evidence of the deceased and the offender arguing and calling each other names. He observed the deceased following the offender and blocking her path when she tried to pass. Patricia Seymour, the deceased's mother, recalled verbal arguments between mother and daughter, with the deceased mainly shouting at the offender. 

13Nicole Seymour, another of the deceased's daughters, gave evidence of the deceased and the offender having arguments and of the deceased chasing the offender to her room. She said that there were occasions when she witnessed the deceased smashing things in anger whilst she was shouting at the offender. She agreed that the arguments between the offender and the deceased had worsened towards November 2010 because the deceased had become more argumentative and lost her temper more quickly, but said that she had not seen the deceased physically touch the offender. Ms Seymour said that she was aware that her mother had been using drugs for a little over ten years, but the deceased's drug use had increased ""severely"" towards November 2010. The deceased was, she said, injecting a lot of ice and speed. 

14I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the relationship between the offender and the deceased had involved verbal abuse and acts of physical violence by the deceased towards the offender. The last occasion of physical violence before 24 November 2010 had been in April of the same year. 

15Mr Crown submitted that the offender's account as to what happened at the time of the stabbing, provided in the second interview conducted by Detective Wiedemann (the second interview) should not be accepted. The Crown referred to the inconsistency in the three versions provided by the offender during this interview. When responding to submissions made by Mr Smith about the deceased's amphetamine consumption, the Crown argued there was no evidence that established that the deceased had been violent in the incident that had led to her death. 

16On the other hand, Mr Smith contended that the court should proceed to sentence on the basis of the version of events proffered in the second interview by the offender, wherever that version is consistent with the jury's verdict. Mr Smith argued that the deceased's amphetamine intoxication pre-disposed her to violence. Although the deceased had an injury to her leg, it was submitted that the court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased's movements were restricted to the extent that they impacted upon the objective seriousness of the offence. 

17A Certificate of Analysis (trial ex P) of the deceased's blood disclosed that amphetamine, methylamphetamine, delta - 9 THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and methadone were detected. Mr Farrar, a forensic pharmacologist, gave evidence that if the deceased was in the excitatory phase of amphetamine absorption that some people can behave very violently at the type of level that was present. He described the concentration of methylamphetamine as being about mid-range. However, the amount of methadone detected was extremely high and indicated that the deceased would not have been capable of expressing aggressive behaviour physically as much as if she was methadone free. Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist, described methylamphetamine as a stimulant drug that can provide feelings of relative invincibility. 

18Debra Portelli, the deceased's sister, said that she last saw the deceased about a month before her death. She described her sister as not being in very good health, that she had a bad ulcer on her left shin and a fused right knee. The deceased did not walk quickly when she saw her. Ms Portelli saw her sister having difficulties arising from a sitting position and would use her hands to push herself up. In cross-examination, she agreed that her sister was not in a hurry on the occasions she had seen her. 

19Dr Packham testified that he had seen the deceased on a number of occasions at Westmead Hospital. The deceased had been on a methadone program of 200 milligrams daily and had a previous history of narcotic addiction. Dr Packham said that the deceased had blockages of the veins in the upper legs, so that both legs were swollen and she had chronic swelling and hardness of the lower legs. A fusion of the right knee meant that she could not straighten this knee completely. 

20Dr Packham explained that the deceased had adjusted to these longstanding problems. He said that whilst she would not have been able to run or move rapidly upstairs, she could walk without too much difficulty and could have hurried if she'd wanted to on a flat surface. He agreed that the deceased was capable of moving quickly over 3 to 10 metres within a house. Dr Packham told the jury that the deceased had chronically abused drugs for many years and was accustomed to using a very large dose of narcotic. He did not think that being affected by drugs, would have impacted upon her ability to get around as she was accustomed to it and had been taking drugs for years. 

21I am not persuaded that the deceased's physical difficulties prevented her from moving quickly towards the offender. As to the effect that the offender's methylamphetamine consumption may have had upon her, Nicole Seymour's observation was that the deceased had become more argumentative and was more prone to lose her temper. Sadly, the deceased was a chronic drug abuser. Although her methadone ingestion may have diminished to an extent the effect of methylamphetamine absorption, I am not satisfied that it had no impact upon the deceased's behaviour after the offender returned home. It is more probable than not that the use of methylamphetamine increased the level of the deceased's anger and aggression towards her daughter. 

22The offender did not give evidence during the trial, but had participated in two electronically recorded interviews with police that were played to the jury. In the first interview the offender lied, telling the police officers that she had spent the night at the home of Joseph Tannous. During the second interview (trial ex CC), the offender relevantly gave the following answers: 

""Q23. ...can you please tell us what happened last night at the house at Girraween, please.

A.I got home and I was sitting in the kitchen and I was making, I was trying to make a sandwich. I just wanted to make a sandwich and go to bed, and I don't know why she got angry and she come up and she charged at me and she head-butted me and then I didn't know really, I don't know, I had a knife in my hand and I just, I just turned around and I just stabbed her. I didn't mean to do it.""

...

Q112....So she gets up and charges at you. What happened then? 

A.I turned around and I hurt her. 

Q113....Did she do anything to you?

A.No, she went to, but before she did, I didn't give her the chance this time. 

Q114....What did she go to do to you?

A.I don't know, just hit me, I don't know. She raised her hand, I don't know what she was going to do with it. 

Q115...Did she strike you last night?

A.She didn't end up, she, she could have, like she went to, but I like, I, I didn't let her, like I don't know, usually she hits me or she will attack me, and I won't do anything, and last night, I don't know, I just, I just turned around and I didn't mean to hurt her.""

...

Q527...When you had a fight with your mum and you stabbed her in the shoulder what did you have as an intention in your mind, what did you think you were going to do, why did you --

AIt was just a reaction, it was nothing in my mind, as she, as she like charged me, I didn't know what she was going to do to me, it was just a reaction. 

Q528Did you intend to kill your mother? 

ANo way, no, I loved my mum, no, we fight but I loved her, I loved her...""

23Detective Wiedemann asked the offender when was the last time her mother had hit her and the offender replied that it was probably a few months ago when her mother attacked her and her son in her room at Girraween and her little sister was there. The offender went on to explain that the deceased had attacked her, had thrown her son at her and dived on her. She had scars on her back from where the deceased had dug her nails in: Q & A 117-128. This account is consistent with the evidence of Brooke Seymour. 

24Other accounts given by the offender of what had happened included Joseph Tannous's recollection to police that the offender told him when they met at Girraween Park between 4 and 4.30am that T 310 45 T 311 2: 

""...her mother screamed out, she come in to headbutt her again. She was scared. She turned. When she turned she doesn't know - she (sic) - knife in her hand. 

...

And she said, you know, the knife went through her arm and she - blood start come out."" 

25Detective Wiedemann gave evidence of a conversation that he had with the offender at Merrylands Police Station at about 3.30pm on 24 November 2010, which included the following T 342 24-29: 

""I said, 'Will you tell us what happened?' She said, 'I came home and was trying to make a sandwich and Mum charged at me. I had a knife in my hand and I turned around and stabbed her. I didn't mean to stab her. I just wanted her to stop.' I said, 'Where did you stab her?' She said, 'Her arm,' making a gesture indicating her left upper arm."" 

26The jury heard the recording of a triple-0 call made by the deceased at about 3.45am. The deceased told the operator that she was bleeding to death. The offender is heard in the background to be saying:

""She pushed me, she pushed me.""
...
""And fucking pushed me."" 

...

""I fucking hate you, I wish you'd fucking die. 

""I fucking hate you.""

...

""You fucking die. Die. You dog.""

...

You fucking attacked me..."" 

27During the second interview, Detective Sergeant Wiedemann asked the offender about the triple-0 call:

""Q477If you are prepared to, can you describe to us what you may have said to your mother at that time and after you had the fight with her and she was stabbed?

AI really don't know what I said to her, I was just so angry, I don't know. 

Q478...You said that to me before, you were angry. 

A Only because she come charging at me, otherwise I was fine, I was ---

Q479O.K.

A---making a sandwich, I was hungry. 

Q480If I tell you that the other person on that recording said, ""I hope you die, bitch"" can you tell me anything about that?

AI could have, I might have said that to her, I could have. 

Q481O.K. 

ABut I don't recall it. 

Q482Was that, and you said that you were angry at the time.

AI didn't mean to do anything to her."" 

28Shortly after the triple-0 call, the offender placed her son in a pram and left the home, taking the knife with her. Ambulance officers arrived at the scene at about 3.55am but had to await the arrival of police at about 4.00am. When the police entered the house, the deceased was found in the family room, but was dead. 

29The stab wound had passed through the back of the left arm and penetrated through the triceps muscle for a distance of about 8 to 9 centimetres. The knife blade continued through the arm severing the brachial artery and cutting the adjacent brachial vein and exited through the front of the arm, just below the armpit. As a consequence of the severing of a major blood vessel, the deceased bled to death. 

30After the offender met Mr Tannous in Girraween Park, he took possession of the knife and threw it onto the roof of a nearby toilet block. 

31It is plain that the various accounts provided by the offender as to the actions of the deceased shortly before her death are not consistent and I do not accept all of what the offender said in the second interview. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased head-butted her or pushed her. I find that when the offender returned home, she went to the kitchen to make a sandwich and for that purpose had a knife in her hand. While the offender was in the kitchen, the deceased who had been lying on a fold up bed in the family room, became angry with the offender. The deceased arose from the bed and rushed towards her daughter, raising her hand as if to hit her. The offender turned and stabbed her mother with the knife once in the left upper arm. 

32It was part of the offender's case at trial that the stabbing was accidental and that she did not intend to hurt the deceased. Any suggestion of accident was demolished by the acrimony manifested by the offender towards the deceased during the triple-0 call and her failure to render assistance. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately stabbed the deceased. 

33Mr Crown invited me to find that the offender had an intention to kill and the matters to which he referred, included the force with which the blow was struck, the offender's aggressive demeanour during the emergency call, the lack of assistance and the offender's ""consciousness of guilt"" given her flight from the scene. However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender stabbed the deceased with the intention to kill. There was no further violence by the offender after the single blow was struck to her mother's arm. Should the offender have intended to kill the deceased, she could readily have continued the stabbing, but did not do so. Furthermore, the extent of the wound does not in the present case determine the question of the offender's intention. Dr Duflou gave evidence that a very sharp pointed knife would require a minor amount of force to enter the skin. He explained that once the skin has been entered, unless the weapon strikes a bone or possibly cartilage, no additional force was necessarily required. The kitchen knife (trial ex K) is sharp and pointed. It remains a reasonable possibility that the offender's expressions of anger towards the deceased in the triple-0 call resulted from the deceased's attack upon her and their turbulent history. 

34I find beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time the offender deliberately stabbed the deceased, she did so with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm upon her. 

35Consistent with the jury's verdict, I find that the offender stabbed her mother as she genuinely believed that she was under attack and it was necessary to do what she did in order to protect herself, but the force she in fact used was excessive in the circumstances. 

36Mr Smith contended that the offender's action was only 'marginally' excessive. Mr Crown argued that this contention should be rejected, that it was the offender who had initiated a physical response and introduced a knife into the incident and the threat posed by the deceased was minor, given her age, her impaired physical condition and lack of a weapon. 

37Contrary to the Crown's contention, the offender did not introduce the knife into the offence, but had been using it for culinary purposes prior to the deceased's aggression towards her. Regrettably, the offender in fear that her mother would physically assault her, resorted to the knife that she had in her hand. The offender did not at any stage maintain that she was in fear of her life. 

38The use of the knife was disproportionate to the threat that the deceased posed to the offender and was unreasonable in the circumstances as the offender perceived them to be. Although the deceased's disabilities had not prevented her from previously assaulting the offender, none of the assaults had been life threatening or had occasioned serious bodily harm or had a weapon been used. A factor that increases the objective seriousness of the offence is that the offender did not fear for her life, but responded with the use of a knife. I do not agree with Mr Smith's contention that the offender's response was only 'marginally excessive'. 

39One of the arguments advanced by Mr Smith was that there was no evidence to suggest that it was readily apparent to the offender how badly the deceased was bleeding at the time she left the house. Furthermore, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the offender overheard the deceased tell the operator in the triple-0 call that she was bleeding to death. 

40During the second interview, Detective Wiedemann, relevantly, asked the offender:

""Q514...Following stabbing your mother was there much blood in the room?

AYes there was. 

Q515 Do you know, was the blood concentrated to just the kitchen area or was it, was the blood spraying around?

A...I don't know, I just seen it on the floor of the kitchen. 

Q516 Is that when your mother was standing or had she fallen over at that stage?

AShe did not fall over when I was there. 

...

Q518What was she doing when you were there? 

AShe was on the phone last time when I left, but she was still standing, still standing. 

...

Q521 ...When you left the house she was still standing, O.K. What did you think would happen with the injury she had? I mean she's bleeding ---

AI didn't know, I honestly didn't know and I swear to you, I promise to God, I didn't know she was going to die.""

41I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was aware that the deceased had been seriously wounded, but would accept that she was unaware that her mother would die from the stab wound. I find that the offender's failure to render any assistance at all to the deceased after the stabbing increases the objective seriousness of the offence. 

42Mr Crown invited me to find as an aggravating factor that the offender's two year-old child was present in the room at the time of the offence. Section 21A(2)(ea) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the commission of the offence ""in the presence of a child under 18 years of age"" is an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. The evidence relating to the child is confined to the offender's answers in the second interview. The offender told Detective Wiedemann (Q & A 74) that her son was asleep on the lounge, that when she picked up her son following the incident that he was asleep (Q & A 504-505). During oral argument, Mr Crown referred to the circumstances of the offence and the loudness of the offender's language on the triple-0 call recording, so as to suggest that the child must have been woken by what had occurred. 

43Mr Smith cited what was said by Howie AJ in Gore v R; Hunter v R [2010] NSWCCA 330; (2010) 208 A Crim R 353 at [104] that s 21A(2)(ea) is ""principally aimed at the deleterious effect that the commission of a crime, particularly one of violence, might have on the emotional wellbeing of a child."" Mr Smith argued that in order to find that the offence is aggravated by reason of the presence of the child, the court would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the child witnessed the offence, or at the very least its immediate aftermath. Mr Smith submitted that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the child was awake and conscious of what was occurring or had occurred. 

44I agree with Mr Smith's submissions. There is no evidence that the child was awake nor can a child be heard during the triple-0 call. I decline the Crown's invitation to take into account this factor of aggravation.

45There are a number of factors that mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence. The offence was not planned, but was committed on the spur of the moment, the offender reacting to the exigencies that she found herself in: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. She did not reach for or obtain a weapon, but used the knife that she was holding to make a sandwich. There was some provocation by the deceased: s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The deceased was the original aggressor and without her aggression, the offence would not have occurred. Furthermore, the offender desisted from inflicting further violence upon her mother after the single knife blow. 

46I do not think that to take into account the offender's aggression as provocation amounts to 'double counting' of matters in the offender's favour. As Rothman J observed in Salah, Dror v R [2009] NSWCCA 2 at [31] the ""subjective element [of self defence] may be present without the objective existence of aggression on the part of [the deceased]."" 

47The offender was born on 31 May 1986 and was 24 years old when the offence was committed. She is now 26 years old. Her prior criminal history reveals offences which were dealt with by way of convictions and fines in the Local Court. There is one previous offence that involved violence, being an assault of an officer in the execution of [his] duty for which the offender was fined $500 in the Bankstown Local Court on 6 March 2007. The offender's record of previous convictions is comparatively minor and does not disentitle her from considerations of leniency. 

48The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. Her subjective circumstances are drawn from a Probation and Parole report (ex B) and from the history provided in Dr Stephen Allnutt's report dated 20 October 2011 (ex 1). 

49The offender shares a common parent with five siblings, of whom she is the third eldest. Her parents separated, but her father remained supportive until his death in 2003. She lived with her mother, but was with her grandmother ""on and off"". The offender related to Dr Allnutt that her relationship with her mother was difficult as she was unavailable, would not listen, would scream and swear at her and had multiple partners and boyfriends. 

50The offender told Jake Docker, the author of the Probation and Parole report, that her childhood was ""characterised by physical and emotional abuse and witnessing domestic violence and illicit drug use by adults and care givers."" Mr Docker reported that contact with the offender's maternal grandmother ""revealed that throughout her childhood, [the offender] was denied basic essentials and had poor adult pro-social modelling."" He stated, ""it would appear that the offender had a problematic childhood and her family environment was less than positive.""

51The offender was educated to Year 8 or Year 9 level, but experienced difficulties at school. She attended a special needs primary school and had learning problems. During her late teens, she used cannabis daily and was a regular user until she entered into custody. She had used heroin for a few months and methamphetamines intermittently. The offender has had three significant relationships resulting in three children. The first two children have been in the care of their biological father and the youngest child was in the offender's care prior to the present offence. Mr Docker reported that the offender ""has had no gainful employment in the community and prior to her current incarceration was in receipt of parenting benefits"": (ex B p1).

52I accept Mr Smith's submission that the offender's upbringing was deprived and dysfunctional and provides a context against which the offence might be viewed. 

53In his report (ex 1 pp5-6), Dr Allnutt considered that the offender ""was manifesting symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder characterised by a depressed mood with disturbances in sleep, reduced appetite, lethargy, reduced motivation, impaired self-esteem, loss of interest in activities [and] an anhedonia with a history of panic attacks."" It appeared to Dr Allnutt (ex 1 p3) that this depressive disorder had its onset in approximately 2005/2006 which was after a suicide attempt and admission to Cumberland Hospital. She had through the years been prescribed a number of medications including Valium and was taking Seroquel 200mg to assist her with her sleep whilst in custody. Dr Allnut noted that the depression persisted after the birth of the offender's child and the offender continued with limited support and ongoing conflicts with the child's father. The offender told Dr Allnutt that she had found living with her mother to be stressful and her depression had worsened overtime. Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the offender's functioning ""was mildly to moderately impaired secondary to ongoing depressive symptoms""(ex 1 p6). 

54Dr Allnutt in a second report dated 16 August 2012 stated (ex 3 p 3): 

""Taken in isolation her depression could have made (sic) more prone to have a negative perception of her circumstances and to irritability and short temperedness and more prone to aggressive outbursts."" 

55The offender is currently taking Effexor 225mg and Seroquel 200mg daily. Dr Allnutt considered that the offender continued to manifest symptoms consistent with a depression. 

56In oral evidence, Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that the offender's depression would have been a contributing factor in the commission of the offence. He explained that ""it is not an uncommon experience for most of us when we feel down, sad, miserable, or depressed we are more likely, if we have a bad day and someone does something to us, to react in an impulsive manner or aggressive manner"": (POS T 15 45-48). 

57During cross-examination by Mr Crown, Dr Allnutt gave evidence that a person who is suffering from depression can go out on the town and appear to enjoy herself, but agreed that a depressed person can be less likely to engage in social behaviour. He agreed that it was possible that depression was not a feature of the offending, but in re-examination said that he considered on balance that the depression had made a contribution. Dr Allnutt could not say to what degree the depression had contributed to the offence. It was, however, a clinical depression of a severity, for which medication would be prescribed. 

58Mr Crown submitted that Dr Allnutt's evidence was unsatisfactory and it had not been established that the depression, if suffered by the offender, was a contributing factor in the commission of the offence. 

59It is hardly surprising, given the offender's deprived background and unhappy relationship with the deceased, that she was suffering from an ongoing depressive illness at the time of the offence. I accept Dr Allnutt's opinion that her depression made her more prone to negative perceptions and to impulsive or aggressive reactions. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender's depression was a contributing factor to the spontaneous use of the knife in her belief that its use was necessary to protect herself from her mother's attack. The offender's moral culpability for her offending is reduced by reason of her depression: R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCA 255 at [23]. 

60Mr Smith submitted that the offender's emotional distress in the second interview, which she continued to manifest during the trial, demonstrated that she was remorseful. Mr Smith also pointed to the statement in the Probation and Parole report that ""[the offender] was able to verbalise her remorse for her actions."" 

61Mr Crown submitted that the offender had not demonstrated remorse for the offence and had not offered a plea to manslaughter at any stage. 

62Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i)(i)-(ii) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that she has accepted responsibility for her actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. 

63The offender did not demonstrate any remorse at the time of or shortly after the stabbing. She did not help or try to obtain any assistance for her mother, but abandoned her. By the time of the second interview, it is apparent that she had come to appreciate and to regret that her mother had died. The following passage in Dr Allnutt's report discloses her present attitude (ex 3 p2): 

""...she missed her mother terribly...she stated 'there are no words I can use to describe how I feel about what happened to my mother'; she did not want to hurt her and had no intention to hurt her; she wished she could turn it around; it made her feel sick when she thought about it."" 

64I accept that the offender regrets having killed her mother and acknowledges her tragic loss. The offender, however, continues to maintain that she did not intend to hurt the deceased. By failing to recognise that she deliberately stabbed the deceased with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm, the offender has not fully accepted responsibility for her actions. I take into account to this limited extent, remorse as a mitigating factor. 

65Although the offender manifests limited remorse, her comparatively minor criminal record, her relative youth and the positive steps taken whilst in custody strongly suggest that she is unlikely to re-offend in this way again. The offender has been in employment and has not been the subject of any custodial administrative or disciplinary charges. The certificates in exhibit 4 demonstrate the education workshops and programs that have been completed. She has been consulting a psychiatrist and is taking medication to address her depression. I consider that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g)-(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, personal deterrence does not have a significant role to play in my sentencing task. 

66During oral submissions, Mr Smith conceded that Dr Allnutt's evidence did not go so far that the court ""could arrive at a view that [the offender] is an inappropriate or less appropriate vehicle for general deterrence"": (POS T 39. 40-45). Notwithstanding this concession, the circumstances of the present offending reduce the weight that I give to general deterrence in the sentence. 

67Mr Smith did, however, submit that the offender was likely to find her time in custody more difficult by reason of her depressive illness. The offender has been receiving treatment whilst in custody for her psychiatric illness and is taking medication. It is clear that the offender's depression can be adequately managed within the prison system and that imprisonment will not be a greater burden for her by reason of that condition. The principles in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 are not enlivened so as to mitigate the offender's sentence: see also R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395. 

68A victim impact statement from Debra Portelli the deceased's sister was read to the Court. The contents of the statement cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.

69The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value, which the community places upon the preservation of human life, is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Donna Marie Seymour has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 

70My attention was drawn to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for offences of manslaughter (ex 5), but the limited use that may be made of these statistics is further diminished by the wide embrace of offending that might amount to the crime of manslaughter: R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 at [27]-[30]. 

71Having considered all possible alternatives, I am satisfied that no penalty other than full time imprisonment is appropriate. The offender was arrested on the day of the offence and has remained in custody ever since. The sentence will commence on 24 November 2010. 

72In my view, an appropriate sentence is one of 6 years 6 months imprisonment. I find special circumstances being the offender's separation from her young son, the need for continuing psychiatric treatment and for assistance to overcome her substance abuse issues. 

73Krystal Jade Seymour for the offence of manslaughter I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months which is to commence on 24 November 2010 and is to expire on 23 May 2014. I set a balance of term of 3 years which is to commence on 24 May 2014 and will expire on 23 May 2017. 

74The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 23 May 2014.

2759969,R v Skinner; R v Elliott [2012] NSWDC 138,"SENTENCE

1Appearing for sentence are two offenders, Shane Skinner and Gregory Elliott. They are each to be sentenced for an offence of conspiring to commit an armed robbery with each other and with two others who I will sentence at a later date, Nathan Hardy and John Genua. In addition Mr Skinner is to be sentenced for an offence of possessing a prohibited firearm, namely a shortened rifle without being authorised to do so. When I sentence him for the conspiracy matter he asks that I take into account a further offence on a Form 1 namely that he allowed himself to be carried in a stolen conveyance. Mr Elliott is to be sentenced for other offences as well apart from the conspiracy. He committed two substantive offences of armed robbery, one on 3 October 2009 and one on 16 October 2009 and when I sentence him for the first of those substantive matters he asks that I take into account some offences of take and drive a conveyance.

2In each of Mr Skinner's and Mr Elliott's case the Form 1 matters involve such minor criminality when compared with the matters on the indictments that they can effectively be ignored.

3Police had been monitoring various telephones and became aware that four men, these two offenders, plus Genua and Hardy were planning an armed robbery. They monitored a number of telephone calls in which the various co-conspirators indicated their willingness to participate in the offence and in which various aspects of the offence were planned. However at about 12.45 pm on 10 November 2009 conversations were captured which didn't accord with the physical surveillance then being undertaken by police. I mention this circumstance because it was the evidence of Mr Skinner, in sentencing proceedings, that whilst he had agreed to participate in the armed robbery with the other three men, when Hardy and Elliot failed to turn up as planned he abandoned the idea and asked to be taken to a railway station so he could go home. Given that the Crown did not cross-examine Mr Skinner to suggest that he had not in fact abandoned the conspiracy, and given the evidence I have just referred to, I propose to sentence Mr Skinner on that basis. 

4So, pursuant to what I have just found is Mr Skinner's intention to go home, he and Genua entered a stolen motor vehicle and drove off. Shortly afterwards it was stopped by police officers. Genua was driving with Skinner in the passenger seat. After the two offenders were arrested police discovered, in the front seat well where Skinner had been seated, a shortened Remington rifle secreted in a black bag. That is the subject of the second offence for which Mr Skinner is to be sentenced. They also located material belonging to the offender Genua including a balaclava and a small replica pistol. 

5Elliott and Hardy were separately arrested and the vehicle in which they had been travelling was searched. In that vehicle police found another replica pistol, another balaclava and a white face-mask.

6Mr Elliott did not give any evidence that he had abandoned the conspiracy. There is nothing at all to suggest that Mr Elliott had any change of heart at all.

7Shortly before the events I have just described Mr Elliott committed two other very serious offences of armed robbery. The first of those was committed on Saturday 3 October 2009. On that occasion Elliott and others robbed an employee of a foreign currency exchange service. The employee unlocked the currency exchange kiosk where she worked. She was prevented from closing the door by the offender who entered the kiosk behind her. He then presented a shortened shotgun and Mr Elliott's co-offender also entered the kiosk. 

8It is difficult to imagine the fear that the employee must have felt but things must have only got worse when the offender actually pointed the shotgun at her whilst pulling her right shoulder down towards the safe and demanding that she open it. She did open the safe and Mr Elliott then placed the shotgun on the floor and removed a large amount of cash which was inside. 

9As if that was not enough, Mr Elliott's co-offender took the unfortunate employee's personal handbag as well as a significant amount of cash from the safe.

10Mr Elliott and his co-offender, together with a third man who was apparently acting as a lookout, ran away and then drove off in a car. 

11All of those events were captured on CCTV surveillance footage and Mr Elliott was identified by the employee when a number of photographs were shown to her. The offenders stole close to $28,000 in Australian currency and the equivalent of about $14,500 in foreign currency. The getaway vehicle was of course stolen and that offence appears on the Form 1. 

12The next offence for which Mr Elliott is to be sentenced was committed a relatively short time later on 16 October 2009. This time the offender and other men targeted a jeweller's shop in Rockdale. Mr Elliott and two co-offenders came into the shop, pulled out hammers from the bags they were carrying, and immediately commenced smashing the glass jewellery display cases. Staff members were present at the time and Mr Elliott pulled out a shortened shotgun and ordered one of the employees to lie down. The employee didn't. He picked up a small coffee table and struck at each of the co-offenders before he threw it towards Mr Elliott's face. Mr Elliott responded by threatening to shoot the employee as a result. 

13Meanwhile another employee threw an office chair at the offenders which caused them to retreat briefly. They continued however to remove the jewellery and place it into the bags they had brought with them. One of the employees then pushed a display case over onto one of the co-offenders and climbed over it, cutting his own right wrist in the process. Once again Mr Elliott pointed the shotgun at the employee, but he was not to be deterred, trying to apprehend the offenders as they ran away. As they did so they left behind two of the three bags they were carrying, the two hammers, and other items. Other witnesses nearby tried to physically restrain the men but they got away. The employee who had cut his wrist required medical treatment. 

14Once more this entire incident was captured on CCTV surveillance footage and once more Mr Elliott was identified as being the man with the shotgun during the robbery after one of the employees was shown a number of photographs. The total value of all the stolen jewellery, both taken by the men and left behind was between $5000 and $6000. 

15The circumstance that no shots were fired by any of the robbers in order to deter the victims from what they were doing tends to suggest that the firearms may have been unloaded. Of course the victims of the robbery were not to know that, but it goes without saying that had there been evidence to establish that the firearms were loaded, this very serious offence would have been even more serious.

16Again the vehicle that was used was a stolen motor vehicle and the second matter on the Form 1 relates to that offence.

17Thus Mr Elliott conspired to commit an armed robbery which appears to have been thwarted only by the intervention of the police and had earlier committed two very serious and violent armed robberies in which entirely innocent people had a sawn off shotgun pointed at them by Mr Elliott. The criminality of this offender is very high indeed. 

18Both men have criminal histories but there is a substantial difference between them. Mr Skinner has never before been dealt with for an offence as serious as the present. He has been a regular offender in the past but has never yet been sentenced in the District Court. 

19All of his offending appears to be related to his addiction to drugs. He is now 38 years of age. He told the Probation and Parole Service that he had a disruptive upbringing. His parents separated when he was seven and he had no contact with his father for the following seven years. They have now re-united and his father is one of his strongest supporters visiting him regularly in gaol and giving evidence on his behalf in a very impressive manner. 

20But things were not always as rosy. At 15, after re-uniting with his father shortly before hand, the offender moved in with his father but then left the family home and had no fixed address. He then commenced his lifestyle of illicit drug use and criminal activity. There have been times in the past where the offender has been able to stay off drugs but, as is obvious, there have always been relapses into drug use and criminal offending. 

21Since going into custody the offender says he has not used any illegal drugs. He has been subject to regular urinalysis and there has been no report of any such testing revealing that what the offender said was untrue. He expressed a commitment to rehabilitation. He attempted to get bail after being accepted into various residential rehabilitation programs but was unable to take up those offers because his bail applications were unsuccessful. 

22He has made the decision, and it seems to be a genuine one, to change his lifestyle on the understanding that if he doesn't do it now he will end up living a wasted life. 

23He is serving his sentence on protection because he was assaulted in prison whilst serving a previous sentence and it is safer for him to be on protection than in the general prison population. However the conditions under which he has been kept in custody are vastly different than those applying to the general prison population. For example at Parklea, where he is at present, he spends less than four hours each day out of his cell and is unable to work in the various industries which are available to the general prison population. It is highly likely that he will serve the rest of his sentence on protection and there is a risk that any further time in custody would also be served under harsher conditions of custody than apply to the general prison population. 

24He expressed his remorse for what he had done and explained that none of it would have happened had he not been a drug user. I am satisfied that Mr Skinner's desire to rehabilitate is genuine and that he has good prospects of doing what he hopes to achieve upon his release from custody. He has substantial family support as well as the support of experts in rehabilitation. He has been accepted into various residential rehabilitation programs and a release plan summary indicating the sort of assistance the offender will receive upon his release was tendered to me during the sentencing proceedings.

25He has spent more than two years in custody awaiting trial and sentence. His pleas of guilty arose in the following circumstances. A trial involving both him and Hardy commenced before me after they both pleaded not guilty. However the trial insofar as it concerned Mr Skinner was aborted after his counsel was unable to continue for personal reasons and so the jury was discharged as concerned Mr Skinner. Mr Hardy was found guilty by the jury and before Mr Skinner could face a re-trial he changed his plea and admitted his guilt. Mr Skinner gave evidence that he had resisted pleading guilty because he had abandoned the conspiracy before his arrest. He said that when it was explained to him that this did not effect the circumstance that he had committed an offence of conspiracy, he pleaded guilty. While that circumstance may be relevant to the question of the offender's remorse it does not effect the utilitarian value of the plea. Accordingly on that latter basis the sentence I impose upon him will be slightly reduced, in the order 10% to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas. 

26Mr Skinner does not fit comfortably into the typical case of armed robbery discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 ACrimR. He is not a young offender with little or no criminal history and the circumstances surrounding the conspiracy suggest that what was planned was a far more serious version of armed robbery than that contemplated by the Court of Criminal Appeal, in fact most likely the sort of armed robbery committed by Mr Elliott which did not involve Mr Skinner. 

27Mr Trevallion who appeared for Mr Skinner on sentence emphasised his client's desire and willingness to be rehabilitated. But it is a fundamental rule of sentencing that any sentence imposed on an offender must reflect the objective gravity of what he or she did. In this regard, given that the offence is one of conspiracy, it is important not to only focus on the actual acts of the offender but to also have regard to the circumstance that agreeing to commit a crime in itself is a significantly criminal matter. 

28I note that pursuant to the agreed facts, the offender first became a part of the conspiracy on the very day he was arrested. I note also that by early afternoon that day he had abandoned the conspiracy and was heading home. Thus the offender's involvement in the conspiracy was very short indeed. He also voluntarily ceased his own criminal behaviour. He was not the driver of the car which was used by Mr Genua as something of an offensive instrument in an effort to get away from police and no ammunition was found for any firearm. These are important matters in assessing the objective criminality of what the offender did. 

29It was Mr Trevallion's submission that the time that the offender has spent in custody is enough, given a finding of special circumstances in his favour. 

30I will make the finding of special circumstances based on the clear desirability for the offender to be given as much assistance as possible upon his release from custody and the circumstance that I expect he will only be granted parole if he then goes into a period of quasi custody as part of a residential rehabilitation program. 

31Another significant factor relevant to the circumstance as to whether the offender has spent enough time in custody already concerns the circumstances of that custody which are, as I have earlier indicated, are harsher than those of the general prison population. 

32In imposing sentence upon Mr Skinner I note that he is to be sentenced for conspiring to commit an armed robbery and faces a separate charge of being in possession of a firearm. In my view there is such a substantial amount of overlap between those two offences, that, together with the other matters I have referred to earlier, the sentences will be entirely concurrent

33I should also note that one of those offences carries with it a standard non-parole period. I have taken into account that standard non-parole period, as well of course as the maximum penalties for both offences, in formulating the appropriate sentences. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period for the possess prohibited firearm matter appear in these remarks on sentence. 

34I will announce the sentence I have decided to impose after dealing with the case of Mr Elliott.

35Mr Elliott is now 32 years of age. He also had an unstable early life, describing himself as an uncontrollable child who attended approximately 15 different primary schools. Because of his behaviour his mother sent him to live with various relatives but he would often run away. 

36He has a long association with antisocial peers, and has been a heroin user for a very long time.

37In the last 13 years, he has spent only eight and a half months out of gaol, and since the 3rd August 2000, a period of more than 12 years, he has been in the community for only 2 months. Exhibit H prepared by Mr Wilson who appears for Mr Elliott shows that Mr Elliott has had only the following periods out of custody since the 3rd January 1999, (when he entered adult custody for the first time):


two days, 
five months six days, 
six days, 
five days, 
four days, 
seven days and 
one month 19 days. 


38It was in that last period that the offender committed the three offences for which he must now be sentenced. 

39To say that that is a terribly sad state of affairs is obviously an understatement. Mr Elliott is clearly institutionalised. He has bleak prospects of being able to remain offence free when he is next released into the community without enormous support from Corrective Services. Unfortunately there is one particular circumstance which has a significant affect on the likelihood that Mr Elliott will get that enormous support and assistance in rehabilitation which he clearly needs. It concerns the fact that he escaped from custody in 2004 and is thus classified E1. A prisoner with that classification is not eligible for work release and the chances that he will be classified in a different manner, thus allowing him the benefits of things such as work release programs are not very good. It is not for judges to make the policy as to how prisoners are rehabilitated but it is undeniable that under current prison policies Mr Elliott will be released to the community, as one day he must, without it being possible for best efforts to be made to ensure that he does not commit further offences soon after release. 

40That this is not a matter of concern to politicians and the wider community is somewhat surprising. Even if what is best for Mr Elliott is put to one side, how about taking into account what is best for the community? As matters stand the prison authorities will not be doing what they can to prevent innocent members of the public being harmed by further offending of Mr Elliott. Any future victim of Mr Elliott's crimes is entitled to look towards the prison authorities and say ""why didn't you do what you could to rehabilitate Mr Elliott?"". From where I sit I doubt that a satisfactory answer could be given. 

41Being tough on prisoners, especially those who escape, is easy. It requires fewer resources to punish someone than it does to rehabilitate them. Even this morning a talk back radio host expressed the view that judges who say that there are too many people in jail are wrong. That same radio host often praises judges, including me on occasions, who impose lengthy sentences. But there is much more to protecting the community than sending people to jail for a long time. Protection of the community from further offending by people such as Mr Elliot requires that substantial efforts be made to rehabilitate them, to give them what they so desperately need to change their behaviour. Those efforts cannot be made in Mr Elliot's case because of the way prisoners who have escaped are treated in gaol. And it is Mr Elliot's future victims who will suffer.

42In this case, somewhat unusually, I have had the benefit of two psychological assessment reports prepared by the same psychologist some years apart. Dr Collins saw Mr Elliott in 2005 when a report was prepared in relation to offending mush less serious than at present. At that time she reported that Mr Elliott was an immature man with low cognitive function and significant psychological disturbance secondary to his poor background. She noted

""it is possible that Mr Elliott may mature out of some of his behaviours as he reaches his early 30's, however, this may only be achieved with ongoing supports upon his return to the community."" 

43The offender is now in his early 30's and when Dr Collins saw him in July this year she reported that Mr Elliott is now at a crossroads and he will either continue on his anti-social trajectory or mature out of his behaviour. Importantly, given what I have just said, about Mr Elliott's classification in gaol, she says 

""I do not believe that Mr Elliott will be able to make positive lifestyle changes without intensive support and supervision being put in place upon his return to the community."" 

44Clearly there is a risk that Mr Elliott will become one of those sad people whose only real home, and the only place they feel comfortable, is prison. Clearly the risk that Mr Elliott will become more fully institutionalised as his time in custody goes on and on is a highly relevant circumstance to the sentence I should impose upon him. 

45Despite the serious nature of his offending it may be better, not just for Mr Elliott, but also for the community, to be able to extend to Mr Elliott a significant measure of leniency, in particular as regards the effective non-parole period. 

46Mr Elliott's pleas of guilty was earlier than Mr Skinner's. I will discount his sentence by 15% to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas.

47Special circumstances are clearly to be found in this case. There is first the mathematical circumstance that he has effectively served a very long accumulative sentence. Secondly there is the realisation that every day that Mr Elliott spends in custody extends his institutionalisation and thirdly there is the circumstance referred to by Dr Collins, but blindingly obvious to everyone (apart perhaps from some talk back radio hosts), that if the community is to be protected from Mr Elliott committing further crimes, the best way of achieving that is by a very lengthy period of close supervision by the parole authorities upon Mr Elliott's release from prison.

For Mr Skinner:

48Taking into account the matter on the Form 1, for the offence of conspiring to commit an armed robbery the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, to date from 8 July 2010.

49For the offence of possessing a prohibited firearm the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years to date from 8 July 2010. 

50In each case I set a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The non-parole period will thus expire on the 7th of October 2012 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. Although it is not me who sets the conditions of Mr Skinner's parole it is my firm recommendation that he only be released to parole on condition that he immediately enter and remain at a residential drug rehabilitation program. 

For Mr Elliott:

51For the offence of conspiring to commit an armed robbery the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 10 November 2009 and a period of eligibility for parole of 2½ years.

52For the offence of armed robbery of The Change Group, taking into account the matters on a Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 10 November 2010 and a period of eligibility for parole of 4 years.

53For the offence of armed robbery of Timely Jewellery, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 3 years and a period of eligibility for parole of 4 years, to date from 10 November 2011.

54The earliest date the offender can be released to parole is 9 November 2014, with an effective overall sentence of non-parole period of 5 years and a head sentence of 9 years.

		04 September 2012",2012-08-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2759982,R v AMOS [2012] NSWSC 1021,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender, Luke Edward Amos, was indicted for the murder of Richard Thurman on 14 February 2009 at Ambarvale. He entered a plea of not guilty on 6 March 2012. The trial commenced on that date and continued until 11 April 2012, on which date, the jury returned a guilty verdict in relation to the count. By its verdict the jury found the offender shot the deceased 8 times causing his death. The Crown has submitted that this was deliberately done with an intention to kill.

2The sentence hearing took place on 20 July 2012. At the hearing the Crown tendered the following documents:

(1)  Exhibit A - a document in the nature of a victim impact statement in the name of Ms Gayle Dalley, dated 20 July 2012.

(2)  Exhibit B - which contains the following documents:

(i)  Impact statement of Ms Geraldine and Mr Tom Thurman;

(ii)  Victim impact statement of Ms Kim Thurman;

(iii)  Criminal convictions history of the offender;

(iv)  Custodial movements history of the offender;

(v)  Sentencing statistics.

3The offender was arrested on 3 February 2010. Accordingly, as at the date of the sentence hearing on 20 July 2012, he had been in custody for a period of 2 years, 5 months and 18 days. The Crown stated that this period should be taken into account and the sentence backdated to the time when the offender went into custody.

Facts at trial
4The Crown conveniently set out in its written submissions a statement of facts for the purposes of the sentence hearing based on evidence given at trial. Mr Stewart, of counsel, who appeared for the offender, stated that there was no dispute to the summary of facts as set out in the Crown's submissions. Accordingly, it is appropriate that I reproduce the following facts based on the Crown's summary:

""6. The Crown says that Luke Amos murdered Richard Thurman by shooting him 8 times with a .22 calibre semi-automatic rifle. The gun used has been identified as the rifle found in Travis Reid's bedroom after being thrown with two other guns over an adjoining fence by the offender. The offender claimed ownership of these guns to Queensland Police, and Ballistic tests in New South Wales confirmed that cartridge cases found at the scene of the murder, came from this firearm.

7. Peter Rafter, a co-accused, has pleaded guilty to Murder and has been sentenced, and has given evidence at trial, that although he only went to Thurman's premises to attempt to get back money he was owed by Thurman, he was aware that the offender was to rob Thurman using a loaded rifle with a silencer attached.

8. Christopher Wiggins, in his ERISP with police, says he drove Amos and Rafter to the scene, he waited in a hotel car-park, the offender came back after about an hour and he drove to pick up Rafter and then drove back to the offenders residence.

9. After the offender shot Thurman, Rafter says he was picked up by Wiggins, in the car the offender was critical of Rafter for running out and demanded they go back. Wiggins drove them back outside Thurman's house and then drove up around the corner and parked.

10. The offender and RAFTER then searched the house and took cannabis, cash, laptops and guitars.

11. Wiggins then later drove the others back to the offender's residence where they went upstairs and divided the proceeds from the house. He then drove the offender and Rafter back to Rafter's house where the offender AMOS had left his vehicle.

Indictment

12. The accused AMOS was charged with the murder of Richard THURMAN on 14 February 2009 at Ambarvale, in the state of New South Wales.

13.T he jury, by it's verdict, has found that the offender AMOS shot the deceased eight times, causing his death. The Crown says this act was deliberate and done with an intention to kill. AMOS was to be paid $2000.00 by RAFTER if a robbery of THURMAN was successful.

Background

14. The deceased Richard THURMAN was a 39 year old man who was involved in dealing moderate amounts of cannabis from his home at 9 Tisher Place, Ambarvale, which is a suburb out near Campbelltown.

15. During late 2008 Richard THURMAN was introduced to the accused RAFTER from Minto. RAFTER then became a ""middleman"" facilitating in the supply of cannabis to THURMAN who would then on-supply to the public.

16. RAFTER was sourcing cannabis from other suppliers including another male from the Minto area, James MIDDLEMISS. MIDDLEMISS had agreed to supply RAFTER with cannabis for $2,200 - $2,400 a pound.

17. RAFTER agreed to supply THURMAN with cannabis for $3,400, which is what THURMAN had told him he was previously paying. RAFTER began supplying THURMAN with cannabis at this rate on a regular basis and RAFTER would profit about $1,000 per transaction. Over the period of this arrangement RAFTER made a net profit of about $10,000.

18. Prior to Christmas in 2008 RAFTER obtained 3 pounds of cannabis from MIDDLEMISS on credit agreeing to pay him when he returned from holiday. In turn RAFTER supplied this cannabis to THURMAN who agreed to pay for it once he had on-sold it.

19. A short time later RAFTER spoke to THURMAN about the money owing. During this conversation THURMAN told RAFTER he wasn't going to pay for the cannabis as he had found out how much RAFTER was paying for the cannabis and he felt that he had been ripping him off.

20. Not long after this RAFTER began to get harassed by MIDDLEMISS and an associate who wanted the money, yet THURMAN continued to refuse to pay.

21. At one stage RAFTER heard that MIDDLEMISS had threatened to firebomb his house if the money wasn't paid.

22. Due to this threat RAFTER approached a friend about obtaining a firearm and was introduced to Luke AMOS (T.172.39):

Q. You just mentioned 303 rifles, how did they get to be in your possession?
A. I was talking to my mate and he introduced me to Luke, and Luke dropped them off at my house.

...

Q. But at some stage did you have a conversation with Luke? 
A. Yes.

Q. And when was that?
A. Oh the last conversation about that was being stressed out and that I wanted the money back.

Q. So did you discuss your need for the ammunition for the 303s? 
A. Yes.

Q. And was that with Luke? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And did you explain anything about that person?
A Yes.

Q. That person being?
A. He was a bit of a crazy person, he went in and out of mental institutions, a big boy.

Q. A big boy, large person, is that what you mean?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you tell him that is Luke, how much you had been buying the cannabis for and how much you had been selling it to Thurman for?
A. I told him that I sold it to him, I had been selling it to him for a while and he had always paid up until now and he found out that I was ripping, oh I wasn't really ripping him off, but over-charging.

Q. And did Luke make any suggestions?
A. Yeah, that's when me and Luke came to an agreement that he would help me get the money back. I told him if he helped me I would give him two grand out of whatever was collected.

...

Q. Where did that conversation take place?
A. I can't remember whether it was at my mate's house or at my house, but we were talking about it and we came to an arrangement that he would help me get the money back.

Q. Just before you get to that stage, when you were talking to Luke, did you tell him what your problems were?
A. Yes.

Q. You had heard, had you not, in fact from one other person, something in relation to fire bombing, what did you hear?
A. I heard that if the debt wasn't going to get paid, that they would fire bomb the house.

Q. Did you explain that to Luke?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you tell him who owed the money to you?
A. Yes, I did.

Q. To Luke, yes?
A. I just told him.

...

HIS HONOUR

23. AMOS supplied RAFTER with two .303 rifles. RAFTER then told AMOS about his problems with retrieving the money from THURMAN and AMOS offered to get the money for him if he could get a ""cut"". RAFTER agreed that if AMOS could get the money from THURMAN he would give him two grand ($2000.00). He then told AMOS where THURMAN lived. A week later the offender AMOS and RAFTER discussed how the offender could get into THURMAN's house when THURMAN had never met him.

24. They decided that RAFTER would visit THURMAN and try to get the money from him whilst the offender waited outside. It was agreed that if RAFTER wasn't out of the house in 5-10 minutes the offender would come in and rob both THURMAN and RAFTER, making it look like RAFTER had nothing to do with it.

25. RAFTER told the offender AMOS that he would need something to scare THURMAN into giving him the money as he was a big bloke.

26. On or about 12 February RAFTER offered to supply THURMAN with a half pound of cannabis, when THURMAN agreed RAFTER and the offender AMOS were satisfied that he had cash with him in the house (T.181.24):

Q. Just in relation to your conversation with Luke, that occurred after you indicated what you wanted him to do, and after he asked whether he could take a firearm, was there any further conversation about whether or not there be any money there?
A. I made a phone call to Richard, asked him if he wanted to buy seven ounces, and he said, ""Yes"", so I said, ""There'd be money there"", because he wanted to buy the seven ounces.

Q. When you sent that message to him, why did you send that message to him?
A. I wanted to make sure that he had the money, all the money at the premises.

Q. Did you have seven ounces of cannabis to sell him, or not?
A. No.

Q. So what was the purpose of sending him that text message? 
A. I wanted to make sure he had money on him.

Q. Did Richard reply to that text message?
A. Yes.

Q. What did he say?
A. ""Yo yo"", basically means ""yes"".

Q. Did Richard, when he indicated something ""yes"", what was his usual expression? 
A. ""Yoyo"".

Q. And in relation to that text, you remember in relation to the actual date of the murder, do you remember when that text message was sent?
A. If I remember it correctly, it would have been around the 8-ish mark.

Q. Around?
A. 8 o'clock.

The offence

27. On 14 February 2009 the offender AMOS arrived at RAFTER'S house at about 8.30pm. At about 9.30 RAFTER sent THURMAN an SMS message. The message read: ""Be over your way soon, leaving my house now.""

28. Shortly after the offender AMOS' driver WIGGINS arrived and the three of them drove to a paddock behind the deceased's house. RAFTER and the offender got out of the car, the offender AMOS carrying a rifle. The offender AMOS told his driver to drive off and wait for a phone call.

29. The offender and RAFTER walked towards the deceased's house stopping beside a laneway where the offender loaded the riffle and placed a silencer over the barrel.

30. The offender AMOS waited in the laneway whilst RAFTER went into the deceased's house. The deceased let RAFTER in and RAFTER sat on a lounge with his back to the door whilst they discussed the money owing.

31. During this conversation RAFTER heard the deceased swear and stand up knocking over the coffee table which was in front of him.

32. RAFTER looked over his shoulder and saw the offender AMOS pointing the rifle at the deceased. He then heard 7 or 8 loud bangs and saw the deceased curl over on the lounge.

33. RAFTER ran out of the house and back towards the paddock hiding behind trees. He spoke with the offender AMOS on the phone and was then picked up by the offender and WIGGINS. Whilst in the car they discussed what had happened and they agreed to return to the house to collect some money and or cannabis.

34. RAFTER and AMOS then searched the house placing property into a backpack AMOS had located in the house. The property taken included:
(a.) an amount of cannabis; 
(b.) an amount of cash;
(c.) 2 x electric guitars;
(d.) 2 x laptop computers;
(e.) 2 x mobile phones; and
(f.) a watch and necklace belonging to the deceased

35. RAFTER and the offender AMOS then left the house and were driven from the scene to the offender AMOS' residence. At the house all three went through the property taken, they counted the cash, $4,500 and agreed to split it between all three of them. They also agreed to split the money made from the sale of the cannabis taken.

After the offence

36. The offender AMOS went to Queensland with his girlfriend. The offender was involved in a domestic violence incident with his girlfriend, and the police were called by her. Before the police arrived, the offender disposed of his weapons, which included the .22 Brno semi-automatic rifle (that killed the deceased), a Stirling .22 lever-action rifle, and a shortened shotgun, by throwing them over the fence behind his premises, to a property where his friend Travis REID lived. He then rang REID and asked him to collect them and store them. REID put them under his bed. He later had REID take the .22 Sirling rifle to his girlfriend's father, to be surrendered to police.

37. Subsequently, Queensland police searched Travis REID's residence with a search warrant, the remaining firearms were found, and the offender AMOS was interviewed by Queensland police in relation to firearms that had been found under his friend, Travis REID's bed.

38. AMOS admitted ownership of these firearms during an ERISP that was taken on Wednesday, 25 November, 2009, at 12.33 pm. These weapons included a .22 BRNO semi-automatic rifle, together with an attached scope and a PVC silencer, a shortened shot-gun and a magazine with 5 live bullets found in a cabinet in REID's bedroom. The .22 BRNO semi-automatic rifle was later tested by Ballistics police in Sydney and was found to be the same weapon used to shoot Richard THURMAN on 14 February 2009 at Ambarvale, in NSW.""

5The co-offender, Peter Rafter, was sentenced on 5 March 2012.

Evidence called for the offender

6A report by Mr John Taylor, forensic psychologist, dated 5 July 2012 was tendered on behalf of the offender (exhibit 1 in the sentence proceedings).

7In his written submissions, Mr Stewart properly acknowledged that the offender, having been found guilty at trial, no discount for plea or for remorse was available. 

8By s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act"") a standard non-parole period is prescribed for a case of murder of 20 years.

Relevant statutory provisions

9Section 3A of Sentencing Act sets out the purposes of sentencing, which are: 

(a) To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;

(b) To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;

(c) To protect the community from the offender;

(d) To promote the rehabilitation of the offender;

(e) To make the offender accountable for his or her actions;

(f) To denounce the conduct of the offender;

(g) To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

10A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life: s 19A(1) Crimes Act 1900. By s 21(1) of the Sentencing Act, a Court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.

11Section 21A of the Sentencing Act requires, that in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the Court is to have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in that section that are relevant and known to the Court.

12When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a Court is required, first, to set a non-parole period for the offence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence) and then specify a balance of term of the sentence: s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act. 

13A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed for the offence of murder by s 54B of the Sentencing Act. However, where a standard non-parole period is prescribed for an offence, a sentencing judge must proceed in accordance with the approach required by law, in particular, as enunciated by the High Court in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 and in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

14The High Court in Muldrock, (supra), stated that it was an error to characterise s 54A(2) as framed in mandatory terms. Where prescribed for the offender, a standard non-parole period is to be considered in accordance with the approach to sentencing prescribed in Makarian v R, (supra), per McHugh J at [51]. That requires that the sentencing judge to identify all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then make a value judgment as to what is an appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case. That approach requires the sentencing judge to be mindful of two legislative guideposts relevant to the offence for which an offender is to be sentenced: the maximum sentence imposed and the standard non-parole period.

15The standard non-parole period is not to be taken as the starting point in the sentencing for the mid-range of an offence after conviction: Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 at [35] per Simpson J.

16The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.

17In sentencing an offender, relevant objective and subjective factors are to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence.

18The Crown, in its written submissions at [48] helpfully summarised the principles enunciated by the High Court in Muldrock (supra). It is not necessary here to reproduce what is there set out. I have, however, had close regard to them.

Crown's Submissions

19The Crown in its submissions properly observed that aggravating factors, that are part of the elements of the offence of murder, must be excluded. The Crown submitted that in this case the following are the relevant aggravating factors which are to be taken into account in accordance with s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act: 

""(eb) the offence was committed in the home of the victim; 

...

(n) The offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity;
(o) The offence was committed for financial gain.""

20The Crown observed that the offence of robbery was planned by the offender and the co-offender, Rafter. It was on that basis that the Crown submitted that in respect of the offence of murder there was an aggravated by the fact that it was part of a planned or organised activity. The Crown, correctly acknowledged that, the murder itself was not planned. The Crown submitted the motive for the offence was financial gain on the basis that if the robbery had been successful the offender would have received $2,000.

21The Crown also observed that the offender had shown no remorse. Remorse may only be taken into account as a mitigating factor where an offender provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for the offence. In the present case that has not occurred as the offender has denied his involvement in the crime.

22In some cases a finding of ""special circumstances"" may be found which provides a basis for altering the statutory ratio of a non-parole period to a parole period specified in accordance with s 44 of the Sentencing Act. As the Crown noted, that provision calls for a decision as to whether a finding of special circumstances can and should be made. If so, whether the particular circumstances of the case justifies a lower proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

23The Crown submitted that despite the offender's youth there were no special circumstances given the nature of his crime, which, it was submitted called for condign punishment.

24The maximum penalty for an offence in the case of murder, life imprisonment, is intended for cases falling within the worst category of case for which the penalty is prescribed.

25It is not possible to prescribe a list of cases that fall within the worst category, although included within it clearly are cases involving an extreme level of culpability. Contract killings have been found to fall within the worst category of case and certain cases involving a planned killing for financial gain may also fall within that category.

26In the present proceedings, the Crown properly observed that on the facts proved, the co-offender, Rafter, did not contemplate that the present offender would shoot the deceased, Mr Thurman. The Crown submitted that the offender shot Mr Thurman when there was no need to do so. His action in doing so, the Crown contended, illustrates the dangerous nature of his character. The Crown submitted that the offence committed by the offender was to be assessed as being in the higher level of a callous murder, although not as serious as, for example, a contract killing as described in Burrell v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 65.

27The Senior Crown Prosecutor amplified this submission in his oral submissions in reply emphasised that notwithstanding there was no premeditated plan to shoot Mr Thurman the facts related to the killing included the fact that he shot his victim eight times and in evidence Ms Webb who said that he told her that he shot him in the body but that as that had not killed the deceased, he shot him in the head. Accordingly, the Crown's submission was that the subject offence was a callous, cold-blooded murder deserving of condign punishment.

28Finally, the Crown submitted the case was just under the worst case scenario, that the culpability of the offender was very high and that a non-parole period substantially more than the standard non-parole period was appropriate.

Submissions for the Offender

29Mr Stewart, on behalf of the offender, properly acknowledged that the fact that the offence was committed in the victim's home was an aggravating factor. As to whether or not the offence could be regarded as part of a planned or organised criminal activity, the submission was that there was no evidence to support that proposition. In particular, it was submitted, the evidence did not establish that the offender attended the vicinity of the victim's premises, having planned or previously decided to shoot at, or murder, Mr Thurman. Mr Stewart submitted that whilst there was planning involved in anticipation of staging a robbery, it could not be said that the murder was at all a planned event.

30The Crown, of course, has the onus of establishing an aggravating factor beyond reasonable doubt. Mr Stewart submitted that there was no evidence upon which a finding could be made to the requisite standard that the offence of murder was planned or premeditated. I have earlier outlined the Crown's concession that the evidence establishes that the robbery was planned, but the murder was not planned. 

31In relation to the issue of the offence having been committed for financial gain, Mr Stewart submitted that the evidence is silent as to the state of mind and motive of the offender in the period from when he was waiting outside the residence to when he entered and shot Mr Thurman.

32Accordingly, it was submitted that there should not be a finding of an aggravating factor in terms of s 21A(2)(o) of the Sentencing Act. 

33In terms of mitigating factors, Mr Stewart relied upon the fact that the offender does not have a record of previous convictions and in particular, does not have any record of convictions for matters of violence. This, he submitted, was to be taken into account by way of mitigation.

34In answer to the Crown's submission as to the level of culpability involved in the offence, Mr Stewart submitted that the absence of planning/premeditation in relation to the offence of murder and the absence of other factors common to cases in the worst category of case leads to the conclusion that the offence in question in this case falls significantly below the worst case.

35Mr Stewart in oral submissions in relation to s 21A(2)(n) relied upon by the Crown, as an aggravating factor, submitted that notwithstanding the fact that there was a plan, a criminal enterprise, the evidence did not support the proposition that part of the plan was to murder Mr Thurman (Transcript 20 July 2012, p 10). He further submitted there was no evidence of what was in the mind of the offender when he was outside the deceased's home and there was ""no planned killing"" (T 11). Further, he had not conveyed to his co-offender Rafter, that he was going to shoot Mr Thurman (T 13).

36Mr Stewart also submitted that the offenders' act in shooting the deceased should be seen as ""impulsive"" rather than planned (T 13). He cross-referenced this to Mr Taylor's report (see report [2.5]).

37Mr Stewart's written submissions additionally addressed the subjective circumstances of the offender. It was pointed out that he is a 23 year old man and he was only 20 years of age at the date of the offence. 

38Mr Stewart, like the Crown, noted that he had been in custody since the date of his arrest on 3 February 2010.

39The fact that he is a young man with no prior convictions was emphasised as a matter of importance in assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed. 

40Ms Christine Bathurst was called by Mr Stewart to give evidence at the sentence hearing. Ms Bathurst had known the offender for some years having first met him in 2003. Ms Bathurst's daughter and the offender formed a relationship at about that time. I will refer to her evidence later in these remarks.

41The report of Mr John Taylor, it was submitted, supported the proposition that the offender had had an extremely difficult family history. He lost his father at an extremely young age and his mother was a drug user and an alcoholic. Reference was made in the report to significant abuse and neglect having been suffered by the offender during his childhood, including that he had been taken into foster care at the age of 10 and for a period of a year he lived on the streets.

42From age 15, he was drinking alcohol on a daily basis. From age 16, he was becoming intoxicated every day and maintained that pattern of drinking until going to prison. He admitted to Mr Taylor that he commenced smoking cannabis at the age of 14 and after a short period, ecstasy on weekends. By the time he was 16 years of age, he was using ecstasy almost on a daily basis and he did that for a period of about 12 months and thereafter, only on weekends.

43From about the age of 18, he began to inhale cocaine about once a week. After approximately 12 months, he was using cocaine several times each week. Mr Stewart's submission was, having regard to the offender's childhood and family background, it would be almost inevitable that the offender would develop significant emotional and developmental issues. Reference was made to the observation of Mr Taylor who said at [8]: 

""However, the nature of his early environment would have had a significant impact on his social and emotional development.""

44It is noted in submissions that the offender had told Mr Taylor that he believed he had not any emotional problems in the past and had never undertaken counselling. However, Mr Stewart submitted that the evidence suggests that at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender was a young man with significant emotional issues resulting from a difficult history. Additionally, he had very little insight into the impact that his history and childhood experience had had on his emotional and behavioural development. 

45Attention was drawn to Mr Taylor's diagnosis that the offender had a personality disorder with antisocial characteristics, as well as a substance disorder. It was submitted that the disorder was related to the dysfunctional childhood history.

46It was submitted that the offender's history and diagnosis and the conclusions of the psychologist provide a possible partial explanation for how he could have behaved in the manner disclosed by the evidence in the case.

47In terms of the future it was submitted that given the offender's relative youth and his troubled background, the Court would be of the view that he has realistic, if guarded, prospects of rehabilitation. It was noted that he had continuing community support from Ms Bathurst and her daughter.

48Mr Stewart submitted that a finding of special circumstances would justify a lower proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period. These included his age, his troubled background, the long-term substance abuse, the fact that he had not previously been in custody or that he had for the first time a realistic opportunity to engage in programs and counselling to address issues arising from his history. All of the circumstances referred to in the written submissions were said to be relevant in determining the appropriate length of the minimum period of actual incarceration.

49Ms Bathurst in evidence stated that she had had close contact with the offender once he took up full-time residence in her home in about 2006. She stated that she considered he was a ""...beautiful young man, he was hard-working, honest, loyal, very loving"" (T at 3).

50She said he worked long hours and became part of her family. He resided in Ms Bathurst's home for the best part of two years and she did not witness any violent behaviour from the offender. Her daughter, who formed a relationship with him, did not complain of any violent conduct by him. The relationship between the offender and her daughter terminated at the end of 2008 and the offender then stopped residing at her premises. Ms Bathurst said she spoke to him a couple of times on the telephone and he visited her home on about two occasions thereafter. She said in evidence that she had been unaware he had any particular interest in firearms. She said did not observe him abusing alcohol in the period that he lived in her house, nor did she see him using drugs.

51Since he has been in custody she has visited the offender on a frequent basis. She said that she intended to maintain her contact and relationship with him by way of support. She believed her daughter would do the same.

52Ms Bathurst agreed in cross-examination that the description that she had given of the offender's character was completely contrary to the evidence that she heard about him during the trial. She agreed that the act of shooting the deceased did not at all equate with her description of his character that she had given in evidence. Similarly, the evidence as to his dealing with guns did not fit with the description that she had given.

53Additionally, she agreed that the evidence at trial as to domestic violence was not consistent with the person she had described in evidence (the offender).

Determination

54The factual findings I am required to make for sentencing purposes, in particular those that inform the objective seriousness of the offender's criminal conduct, including but not limited to the question of intent, must be consistent with the jury's verdict. Any findings of fact adverse to the offender, again including but not limited to the question of intention, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

55In determining an appropriate sentence, in this case it is necessary to bring to account all of the relevant circumstances bearing upon the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective factors to which I have referred. Before doing so, it is appropriate to have regard to some observations that assist in applying relevant principles to the circumstances of the case.

56It is well-accepted that whilst all murders are, of course, to be regarded as extremely serious, the range of circumstances which may bear upon the objective gravity of this category of crime is widely variable: R v White [2005] NSWSC 667 at [33]. Questions of planning and premeditation are, as would be expected, important matters in determining sentence. The absence of planning is one factor to be evaluated and weighed along with all other relevant factors in determining the objective circumstances of the offence. In some cases the absence of planning has been considered to be a matter that may reduce the objective seriousness: see R v Shepherd [2006] NSWSC 799.

57In the case of murder, the state of mind with which the offence is committed is an important consideration upon the issue of the objective seriousness or the gravity of the offence. Murder may be established by proof of an act causing death committed when the act is accompanied by one of three states of mind: they are; an intention to kill, or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm or reckless indifference. Those states of mind may often be taken as operating in descending order. 

58It has been stated that an intention to kill, as distinct from either of the other two alternatives, is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness than lesser: Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [49] per Simpson J.

59Similarly, in the Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 at [34], McClellan CJ at CL stated: 

""It may be accepted that a murder which is not premeditated would usually be less serious than one which involves planning. However, murder is a crime which can be committed under a very wide range of circumstances and the absence of premeditation does not dictate a finding that the objective seriousness of a particular offence falls below the mid-range.""

60That case was decided before the High Court's decision in Muldrock (supra) so that statement as to the objective seriousness and absence of premeditation must be considered with that in mind. The fundamental point, however, as expressed in that case is that the absence of premeditation may be offset, at least to an extent, by other factors that point the other way and which may affect the objective gravity of an offence.

61The issue of future dangerousness of an offender may also be relevant. However, that said, it is impermissible to increase an otherwise appropriate sentence merely to achieve preventative detention: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 473-474. A risk of re-offending, however, is a matter that may be considered. Having regard to evidence at trial a sentencing judge is entitled to take the relevant circumstances into account in determining the question of future dangerousness: Crown v Garfoth (23 May 1994, NSWCCA, unreported).

62That said, potential dangerousness is not a matter to be given such weight as to lead to a penalty that is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence.

63Another factor may be taken in to account is whether or not the murder was motived by financial greed. Where that is proved it can constitute an aggravating factor: Adanguidi v R [2006] NSWCCA 404; (2006) 167 A Crim R 295 at [4]; R v Smith [2000] NSWCCA 202 at [164] and [166].

64In the present case, I make findings in accordance with the undisputed statement of facts to which I have earlier referred. The evidence supports, beyond reasonable doubt, the following facts:

(i) That the offender and his co-offender Rafter entered into a planned arrangement to recover monies from the deceased.

(ii) That the offender and Rafter agreed between themselves that, as necessary, they would recover the monies from the deceased by means of armed robbery

(iii) The offender and Rafter embarked upon the criminal enterprise with the offender arming himself with a loaded rifle.

(iv) It was part of the agreed criminal enterprise that the offender would use the rifle as necessary to effect armed robbery upon the deceased. 

(v) A short time after Rafter entered the house and confronted the deceased, the offender took it upon himself to enter the house, point the loaded weapon at the deceased and then fire the .22 calibre semi-automatic rifle eight times thereby killing the deceased.

(vi) The deceased was not armed with any weapon at that time.

65On the basis of the above findings, it is clear that the enterprise agreed upon would involve the use of the weapon as necessary to effect an armed robbery. The offence or murder arose in the course of and occurred as part of a planned or organised activity, namely the planned offence of robbery. That, on the evidence and facts to which I have referred was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act.

66At some point between the co-offender Rafter entering Mr Thurman's home and the shooting, the offender formed the intent to kill the deceased. The evidence does not permit a finding to be made beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had formed an intention to kill the deceased prior to him entering the deceased's house. The fact that after he entered it pointed the semi-automatic .22 calibre rifle directly at Mr Thurman and then fired it plainly establishes, beyond reasonable doubt, that at the time of firing the weapon he had the intention to kill the deceased. The shooting of Mr Thurman occurred very soon after he stood up and indicated to Rafter that he refused to pay the alleged drug debt. 

67Whilst the evidence does not support a finding of pre-meditated intention in the offender to kill the deceased before he entered Mr Thurman's home, the circumstances in which he fired the semi-automatic rifle discharging eight projectiles at the deceased, significantly adds to the objective seriousness of the offence. It was and I find to the requisite standard a callous murder involving a high level of culpability.

68On the evidence and the findings I have made, the factors which aggravated the offence of murder were:

(i) Firstly, as I have stated that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity;

(ii) Secondly, that the offence was committed for financial gain;

(iii) Thirdly, that the offence was committed in the home of the victim, Mr Thurman.

69I have earlier set out the submissions on behalf of the Crown and the offender. I have given close consideration to all submissions and have, in particular, brought into account all the mitigating and subjective factors that have been raised on behalf of the offender in determining sentence.

70In making that determination I have taken into account that this is a case of a young offender of 20 years of age, who had no prior convictions, and who had a deprived upbringing. 

71The principles that apply to the sentencing of young offenders and the importance of their rehabilitation are well-established and are to be applied in this case in the context of the facts. By reason of an offender's immaturity, an offence can be attended by some excess, or a particular act of sudden violence may occur, which someone who is more mature would not engage in. This may occur with an immature person has been brought up in a violent environment, where all too readily violence is a first response to any kind of opposition. The evidence does not establish sufficient circumstances to put this case in that category.

72In R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459, Hunt CJ at CL with whom McInerney and Sully JJ agreed, addressed the factors relevant to the sentencing of a 19 year old offender in respect of serious offences. His Honour there observed:

""Although the respondent was not a person to whom the provisions of s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 applied - namely, someone under the age of eighteen years - his youth is not to be disregarded in the sentencing process. Far from it. But it does mean that general deterrence remains of primary importance and, where a youth conducts himself in the way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the protective function of the criminal courts would cease to operate unless deterrence and retribution remained significant considerations in sentencing that youth: ... The respondent, moreover, had already accumulated by that age the appalling record to which reference has earlier been made."" (at 469)

73See also the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v AEM & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96] to [102] in relation to the interrelationship to general deterrence and the youth of an offender.

74The evidence at trial established beyond reasonable doubt that he returned to the deceased's home after killing Mr Thurman and set about finding the deceased's money. 

75The offender has, having refused to accept responsibility for the murder, demonstrated neither regret, nor remorse, at what he had done.

76Based on the tests administered by Mr Taylor and his analysis of the offender's personality and background, it is clear that he has a personality disorder with anti-social characteristics and a substance abuse disorder. His anti-social attitudes, no doubt on the evidence, may be traced back to his having been raised in a dysfunctional and abusive early family environment. That, of course, in no way mitigates the seriousness of his offending. It however, provides a background which throws some light on the deep seated behavioural issues identified by Mr Taylor.

77These matters, in other words, provide insight and explanation, but of course, they do not in any way provide any justification for the tragic and the extremely serious offence of murder in this case.

78They are factors all to be brought into account on sentencing and are to be given appropriate weight in the consideration of issues of reformation and rehabilitation of the offender when determining sentence. 

Victim impact statements
79I have read the victim impact statement of Ms Geraldine and Mr Tom Thurman dated 12 July 2012. They have stated in concise terms the enormous loss they have experienced with the tragedy of their son's death and the difficulties they have experienced since then and until the guilty verdict was given.

80The statement of Ms Kim Thurman eloquently states the enormous impact that the tragedy of her brother's death has had upon her.

81These statements by law cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I, however, acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express, on the community's behalf, sympathy and compassion for them.

82In the determination of the appropriate sentence, I have also had regard to the subjective factors to which I have earlier referred, including, in particular, the offender's relatively young age and deprived upbringing. The deprivation undoubtedly had some bearing upon these developments leading to the crime.

83Finally, I have also had regard to the fact that the nature and the circumstances of the offence provides some support for the existence of a risk of re-offending by the offender in terms of future dangerousness. As I have earlier stated, however, this of itself, is not a factor that permits an increase in an otherwise appropriate sentence. It may be considered as a factor which modifies either in whole or in part a potentially mitigating feature of the case. I have taken it as but one factor that is to be considered as a mitigating factor, along with the mitigating factor to which I have referred.

84Taking all circumstances into account and based on the findings that I have earlier referred to, I have concluded that the appropriate non-parole period is a period of 21 years imprisonment with a balance of term of seven years.

85In relation to the question of special circumstances, I have considered the matters raised in submissions on behalf of the offender. I have also had particular regard to matters set out in Mr Taylor's report. That report indicates that the offender has at least a moderate risk of recidivism, although I note the variations in the various assessments set out in Mr Taylor's report at [2.8]. The results of psychometric testing diagnose him as having an anti-social personality disorder and an above average predisposition to engage in substance abuse. Mr Taylor has opined that the offender does have some prospects for rehabilitation and that these prospects would be assisted if he were able to maintain his supports in the community. However, on the basis of this assessment any prediction as to the prospect for rehabilitation must be considered to be guarded.

86I do not consider that the evidence would support or warrant the finding of special circumstances. Accordingly, I decline to make such a finding.

87Taking into account all factors that are relevant to sentence I conclude that the appropriate overall sentence is 28 years. Applying the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the parole period produces a non-parole period of 21 years which I consider to be the appropriate minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence.

88As I have earlier stated the prescribed standard non-parole period for the offence of murder is 20 years. In accordance with the provisions of s 54B(4) of the Sentencing Act, I record that the longer non-parole period to be imposed of 21 years, as against the standard non-parole for the offence, takes into account the fact that the offence was committed in the home of the deceased, a factor within s 21A(2)(e) of the Sentencing Act and that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity a factor within a 21A(2)(n) of the Sentencing Act.

89Luke Edward Amos for the murder of Richard Thurman, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 years which is to commence on 3 February 2010 and to expire on 2 February 2031 and a balance of term of 7 years to commence on 3 February 2031 and to expire on 2 February 2038.

ORDER

91The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole is 2 February 2031.

2759985,Bott v R [2012] NSWCCA 191,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Finnane DCJ (the judge) in the District Court at Sydney on 28 October 2011. He had pleaded guilty to a charge of kidnapping, pursuant to s 86(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. An offence of intimidation pursuant to s 13(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 had been included on a Form 1 and was taken into account by the judge on sentence. This offence is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or 50 penalty units, or both. 

3The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing on 27 October 2011 and expiring on 26 October 2012 with a balance of term of 18 months expiring on 26 April 2014. The judge directed that the applicant be released to parole on the expiration of the non-parole period. 

4The judge had discounted the sentence by twenty five per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 

5The notice of appeal identifies three grounds:

1.The sentence imposed in all the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 

2.The Learned judge erred in considering matters, which were improperly taken into account on passing sentence. 

3.The Learned judge erred in his assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

6The applicant requires an extension of time in which to make an application for leave to appeal. After an adequate explanation was provided by the applicant for the delay, the Crown withdrew its opposition to an extension of time being granted. 

Facts 

7The circumstances of the applicant's offending were the subject of a five page statement of facts. 

8When the plea of guilty was entered before Knox DCJ on 3 May 2011, the statement of facts was tendered. The applicant's counsel informed Judge Knox that there was an issue ""regarding one or two areas of the Crown's version"" but there was no need to call evidence because they did not effect the applicant's plea: T 5 35-40. During the proceedings on sentence before the judge on 30 September 2011, the statement of facts was placed before his Honour and the applicant did not give evidence. The applicant does not complain in any ground of appeal that there was error in the judge's findings of fact. 

Background 

9The background to the offending may be conveniently summarised. Michael Johns, the victim, was a finance and property broker. His business associate was Brenton Tong. In November 2007, Johns met Ibrahim Sengoz and Mark Garofali at Tong's office in Clarence Street, Sydney. Sengoz had previously borrowed $500,000 from Tong which was secured by a second mortgage on a three unit residential development at Terrigal. The National Australia Bank, the first mortgagee had repossessed the development and it was to be auctioned. At the meeting, Sengoz and Garofali proposed to purchase unit 3 in the development at the auction. Both Tong and Johns advised them against this course of action. 

10Shortly after this meeting, Johns and Tong learned that Garofali had purchased the unit for $1.39 million at the auction. Garofali signed a mandate for Johns to act on his behalf to find a lender willing to lend him $1.3 or $1.4 million. 

11Johns was unable to find a lender for Garofali. Sengoz and Garofali had also approached Tong to find them a lender, but he too had been unsuccessful. 

12Garofali was unable to complete the purchase of the unit and his deposit of $139,000 was forfeited. 

13At a meeting on 4 March 2008 at the Menzies Hotel, Johns learned that Garofali had borrowed $140,000 for the deposit on the unit from Sharon Coghlan and John Zammit. Garofali had agreed to repay this amount plus $60,000 interest. When the agreed amount was not repaid, a $10,000 late fee was added taking the total amount owed to $210,000. Garofali and Sengoz blamed Tong and Johns for the failure of the unit venture. They claimed that Tong had promised to source finance which he had not done, causing the deposit to be lost. Johns left the hotel before the meeting was concluded. 

Form 1 - intimidation s 13(1) Crimes (Domestic Violence) Act 

14On 9 July 2008, Johns had a meeting with Zammit and Coghlan in the courtyard of the Soprano's Bistro at Surry Hills. The applicant was also in attendance. During the meeting, Zammit's attitude towards Johns became aggressive. Zammit asked the applicant, ""What do we do in our world or business if somebody owes us money and doesn't pay?"" The applicant responded, ""In our world we get our money back...We go pick 'em up."" The applicant said to Johns, ""This is your problem now, you owe us the money."" 

15Both the applicant and Zammit said, ""We want you to go and get Brenton "" Fearing for his safety, Johns agreed to find Tong and bring him to Zammit at the Menzies Hotel.

16Johns had a Blackberry mobile phone, a black diary and two novels on the table in front of him. The applicant pushed these items towards Zammit, who took them and gave them to Coghlan, who kept them. The applicant said, ""That's ours"". Johns was told by one of the group that he could have his property back when he presented Tong. 

17Johns described the applicant as aged in his mid 30's, 180cm tall, large muscular build, dark brown or black shoulder length hair tied back with a black plaited fabric headband. 

The offence of kidnapping s 86(1)(b) Crimes Act 

18While Johns was attending a business meeting with Mr Romeo, a client, at the Woollahra Hotel on 16 July 2008, the applicant approached him and said, ""You didn't come back last week. Why didn't you come back?"" Johns replied, ""It has got nothing to do with me. You took my shit, give it back."" The applicant then said, ""We want you to take us to Brenton or bring us to him. We have been to his address that Brenton has given us, but he doesn't live there. Brenton owes us money. Do you know who you are dealing with? This is the bikies money. We want you to go in the building in town in Clarence Street and hit the security button to get him to come down."" 

19Johns refused to do this and asked about the return of his property. The applicant said, ""Yeah I've got it in my car outside."" Johns asked for his property to be brought to him. The applicant said, ""No you're going to come with us now."" Johns refused to go to the applicant's car, however, eventually agreed if Mr Romeo would accompany him in order to retrieve his property. 

20They then all left the hotel and walked along Moncur Street, Woollahra. Approximately 3-4 metres past the intersection of Moncur and Rush Streets, Johns decided to return to the hotel as he had became fearful of being too far from his vehicle. As he turned to walk back in the direction he had come from, the applicant tackled him. Johns asked Mr Romeo to call the police. As the applicant tried to drag Johns up Rush Street, Johns saw a second solidly built islander male, with short cropped hair, who he recognised from the meeting at Soprano's bistro, walking down Rush Street. Johns began to yell and scream and the second male took hold of the rear of his pants. As he was being carried up Rush Street, the applicant said, ""You've coming with us"". Johns was carried approximately 50 metres from Moncur Street to where his vehicle, a blue Subaru was parked in Rush Street. 

21Upon reaching Johns' vehicle, the applicant and the other male put Johns down. The applicant twisted Johns' arm behind his back causing him to feel pain while the second male searched Johns' pockets for his car key. Johns told them that his car key was in his right pocket. After removing the key from Johns' jean pocket, the second male unlocked and opened the driver's side door of the vehicle. Johns continued to scream and struggled against the applicant's hold. 

22Fearing serious injury if he was taken in the vehicle with the applicant and the other male, Johns kicked the driver's door shut. The applicant pulled Johns away from the door towards the front of the vehicle. As he did this, Johns kicked the front right guard of the vehicle leaving a dent in it and causing the car alarm to sound. The applicant and the other male ran across Rush Street and into Moncur Street. Johns dialled triple-0. 

23Following investigations by police, the applicant was arrested on 15 October 2009. 

Subjective circumstances 

24The applicant did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. A Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report was before the judge that disclosed that the applicant had migrated from Tavalu to Australia when he was 6 years old with his older sister and her husband who became his adoptive parents. He was born on 22 July 1965 and was 42 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. The applicant resided with his wife and three children in Sydney. Mr Watling, the author of the report noted that the applicant's wife believed that he had matured significantly in recent years and did not associate with negative peers from his past, which was re-iterated by the applicant's adoptive father. The applicant had told Mr Watling that he had become involved as a young man with a number of negative associates through his job as a security guard in the nightclub industry. He was at the time of the preparation of the report a part owner in a vehicle inspection company at Tempe. Mr Watling reported that he was a highly motivated, integral member of their team and had been involved in the business since September 2008. The applicant was also a project manager for a property development in Queensland on behalf of his adoptive father's family trust. 

25The applicant told Mr Watling that prior to the commission of the offence, an associate borrowed approximately $25,000 from him and said that he could not pay him back until he received money owed to him from a third party. The applicant claimed that the offence came about whilst he was assisting his associate to get his money so that he in turn could be reimbursed. The applicant stated that in his business as a property developer, and in particular, among his associates in the same field, intimidation is a common form of collecting debt. He initially thought the offences to be of a minor nature, however, claimed that he now realised his involvement was a mistake and his actions were inappropriate. 

26Mr Watling observed:

""[the applicant] presented as a quiet, confident man who willingly related his personal and work history in detail. He appears to have been involved with a number of anti-social peers throughout his adult life that have influenced his attitude in relation to socially accepted behaviour and appropriate conflict management. The offender's attitude to the offences indicates that although his current behaviour demonstrates a law abiding lifestyle he would still benefit from clarification of criminal orientation through appropriate pro-social influences."" 

27The applicant's prior criminal history discloses convictions for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and goods in custody (1986) malicious injury (1987), conspiracy to import a prohibited import (1998) and stalk/intimidate to cause fear (2006). He was sentenced for the conspiracy charge to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. For the offence of stalk/intimidate, the applicant was placed on a s 9 good behaviour bond for 12 months on 7 March 2006 in the District Court at Lismore. 

28Before considering the first ground of appeal that complains of manifest excess, it is appropriate to deal with the second and third grounds that raise complaints of discrete error. 

Ground 2: The Learned judge erred in considering matters, which were 
improperly taken into account on passing sentence. 

29The applicant contends in written submissions that the judge placed too much emphasis on irrelevant matters in his sentencing remarks, which included an alleged breach of bail, association with an unlawful motorcycle gang and that the applicant was prepared to practice extreme violence on the victim. The consideration of irrelevant matters is said to have clouded the judge's mind, aggravating the offences before the court and ultimately ruling out the possibility of a non-custodial sentence. 

30In his remarks on sentence, the judge noted that the applicant was granted bail following his arrest, but had gone to Fiji for a holiday in contravention of his bail and had returned (ROS at 3). The issue of the applicant's bail arose during the proceedings on sentence before the judge as the applicant's counsel in written submissions had mistakenly submitted that the applicant had been on stringent bail conditions since his arrest and had not breached them, thereby demonstrating an ability to comply with court orders and to conduct himself in a lawful manner. His Honour was further required to consider whether the applicant's bail was to be continued until sentence was pronounced. I am not persuaded that the judge's references to bail were anything more than a recitation of what had occurred since the date of the applicant's arrest. 

31The focus of the applicant's complaint about the judge's reference to an unlawful motorcycle gang is the judge's remarks at (ROS 6):

""As I have indicated from the facts the threats that formed part of the Form 1 are an essential background to this matter. If the victim took seriously those threats he would accept that this man, the offender, was a member of an outlaw motorbike gang, that that gang was owed the money and they would do considerable violence to get the money back. Now that may all have been lies but those words it appear were said."" 

32When the applicant confronted Johns at the Woollahra Hotel on 16 July 2008, he said: ""Do you know who you are dealing with? This is the bikies money."" Undoubtedly the applicant spoke these words to place Johns in fear and to add emphasis to his intimidating conduct during the meeting at Soprano's Bistro. His Honour's remarks were appositely made and do not disclose error. 

33As to the complaint about the reference to violence, the judge did not say that the applicant was prepared to practise extreme violence on the victim. His Honour said (ROS at 7): 

""There is no evidence he was going to practise extreme violence on him. But there is certainly evidence that he and this other man were prepared to use violence for the purpose of achieving their ends. It is reasonable to suppose that he did this for the purpose of getting money for himself."" 

34The applicant used violence when he prevented Johns from returning to the hotel and dragged and carried him to his motor vehicle. The observations made by the judge were open to him and his Honour did not err. 

35There were further matters advanced for the applicant in oral argument. The applicant submitted that he was incorrectly sentenced by the judge for the aggravated offence of kidnapping under s 86(2) whereas he had pleaded guilty to the basic offence under s 86(1)(b). The Court's attention was drawn to the commencement of the judge's remarks where he said (ROS 1):

""The offender...comes before this Court charged with an offence under s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act namely that on 16 July 2008 whilst in the company of someone else he took Michael Johns without his consent with intent to obtain an advantage namely to gain access to Brendon (sic) Tong."" (italics added) 

36A factor of aggravation that brings an offence of kidnapping under s 86(2) is if the offence is committed in the company of another person: s 86(2)(a) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for the aggravated offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 

37Although in his introductory remarks the judge incorrectly referred to the applicant being before the court on a charge of an offence ""whilst in company"", he correctly identified the section under which the applicant was charged as being s 86(1)(b). When he turned to consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed, his Honour stated that the maximum penalty was 14 years imprisonment (ROS 5) and remarked that the applicant was not charged with ""the aggravated form"" of the offence (ROS 6). I am not persuaded that his Honour sentenced the applicant for the aggravated offence under s 86(2) Crimes Act. 

38Another complaint was that by being placed on more stringent bail conditions, the applicant was given a reasonable expectation that a full time custodial sentence would not be imposed. There is no merit whatsoever in this argument. A grant of bail pending sentence does not give rise to any expectation of the sentence to be passed. The considerations that apply to the grant of bail are different to those that determine an appropriate sentence. 

39I would reject Ground 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 3: The Learned judge erred in his assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.

40The applicant contends that the judge was wrong to describe ""rehabilitation as only a possibility"". Mr Watling, the author of the Probation and Parole report, was said to have expressed the opinion that the applicant had good prospects for leading a law-abiding lifestyle and was suitable for a community service order. The applicant submits that the facts of the case did not allow for the judge's determination on rehabilitation to be made. 

41During his sentencing remarks, the judge carefully considered the Probation and Parole report and the applicant's prior criminal history. His Honour referred to Mr Watling's observation quoted at [26] above, that although the applicant's current behaviour ""demonstrates a law abiding lifestyle, he would still benefit from clarification of criminal orientation through appropriate pro-social influences"" (ROS at 5). His Honour later said (ROS at 7): 

""The principles of sentencing require that I take into account prospects of rehabilitation, and I do, there are some."" 

and (ROS at 7):

""In my opinion offences of violence of this nature by people who have serious criminal offences in their record which suggests that rehabilitation is only a possibility require sentences of full time custody."" 

42The judge was entitled to be reticent about the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. The applicant had not expressed any remorse for his offending and there was little evidence that he understood the seriousness of his conduct. The good behaviour bond for the offence of stalk/intimidate had expired in the year prior to the commission of the offence, but had not deterred the applicant from intimidating and detaining the victim. His Honour's approach to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation was within the proper exercise of his sentencing discretion and I would reject Ground 3 of the appeal. 

Ground 1: The sentence imposed in all the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 

43The applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust in order to make good his complaint that the sentence is manifestly excessive: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. Intervention by this court is not warranted simply because it might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the sentencing judge: Markarian at [28]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57]. 

44It is contended for the applicant that the sentence imposed by the judge was manifestly excessive notwithstanding that the offence contrary to s 86(1)(b) Crimes Act called for a strong measure of deterrence. The applicant conceded that the victim would have been put in a position in which he may have feared for his personal safety. However, he argues that the victim was detained for ""a mere five seconds"" and did not receive any substantial injury. If any violence was used, it was minimal and there was no evidence to demonstrate that the applicant had suffered any substantial injury. Furthermore, the Probation and Parole report highlighted the strong subjective features of the applicant's case, which included family, gainful employment and detachment from his criminal peers. 

45The applicant had asked the judge to suspend any custodial term that might be imposed and respectfully suggests to this Court that he be re-sentenced to a supervised suspended sentence of imprisonment. Another option that had been proposed to the judge was an intensive correction order. It is convenient to note that a court may only suspend a term of imprisonment or may impose an intensive correction order where the sentence is not more than 2 years imprisonment: ss 12; 68, 69 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

46In response, the Crown submitted that the applicant's presence at the Soprano's Bistro was to persuade the victim, by intimidation, to co-operate. When the victim failed to do so, he was kidnapped. The applicant was an enforcer, who was prepared to intimidate, use violence and kidnap to bring his principles' wishes. The kidnapping offence and the offence on the Form 1 were premeditated and the very type of conduct in which the applicant engaged emphasised the need for general deterrence. 

47In Allen v R [2010] NSWCCA 47, Latham J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreed) referred at [20] - [21] to the factors relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence contrary to s 86(1)(b) Crimes Act: 

""[20] The combination of factors relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence under s 86 of the Crimes Act were identified by this court in R v Collett & Robson (NSWCCA, unreported, 7 June 1979), per Roden J, as the duration of the detention, the extent of fear or terror occasioned, the manner of treatment and what is demanded of the victim by the offender, the purpose of the detention, and the extent (if any) to which third parties were subjected to ordeal or anguish by reason of fear for the welfare of the victim.

[21] In R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183, Howie J (Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing) said:

32 'The gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing is the unlawful detaining of a person. As his Honour noted, there are a number of factors that can be relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offence under s 86 including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. The last factor, the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain, is not, in my view, conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence.'
This approach was reiterated by Howie J (Dunford J agreeing) in R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335.""

48In my opinion, the applicant's submissions trivialise the seriousness of his offending. The judge recognised that the victim was unlawfully detained for a short time during which he was subjected to violence and feared for his safety, but correctly rhetorically asked, but for the victim's activation of the car alarm ""who knows exactly how long he would have been held or what would have happened"" (ROS at 7). The judge found that the victim was detained with the view ""ultimately to getting access to [a] man whom they believed could be persuaded by force if necessary, to hand over money"" (ROS at 6). 

49Garofali owed $210,000 to Zammit and Coghlan and it was this amount that the applicant planned to extract from Tong after he had gained access to him by detaining the victim and placing him in fear. It seems that the advantage that the applicant sought to personally obtain by his violent and intimidating conduct was an amount of about $25,000. 

50It is important to emphasise that a civil society cannot tolerate standover merchants who seek to recover money or obtain information from others by fear and violence. The applicant's lack of insight into the seriousness of his conduct and his understanding that intimidation is a common form of debt collection emphasise the importance of both specific and general deterrence in the sentence. 

51Although this offence is not the most serious of its kind, a full time custodial sentence of more than 2 years was called for. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment. The judge was entitled to increase the sentence by reason of the applicant's intimidating conduct at the Soprano's Bistro: (the Form 1 offence). 

52The judge plainly took into account the applicant's subjective case which included his strong family support and favourable work history in moderating the length of the sentence. Notwithstanding not expressly making a finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period of 12 months was imposed, which is 40 per cent of the head sentence. 

53The applicant has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Orders 

54Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

1. The extension of time to seek leave to appeal is granted. 

2. Leave to appeal granted. 

3. Appeal dismissed. 

55McCALLUM J: I agree with Price J.

		31 August 2012",2012-08-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760002,R v Kevin Gall; R v Bruce Gall (No 4) [2012] NSWSC 1355,"Judgment
1At the close of his case, the accused Bruce Gall submitted that it was not open to me to leave to the jury the alternative verdict of accessory after the fact to manslaughter and that accordingly the jury ought not be directed as to the availability of such an alternative verdict.
2The submission has two bases: first, that the way in which the indictment is pleaded excludes the alternative verdict; and secondly, that s 349 of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act) does not contemplate an alternative verdict, which is accordingly excluded.
3The indictment relevantly charges that:
""1. KEVIN ANTHONY GALLOn 16 April 2010 at Girraween in the State of New South Wales did murder Neil Leopold GREEN.Section 18 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) ...
2. BRUCE EDWARD GALLKnowing the said Kevin GALL to have committed the said murder, afterwards on 16 April 2010, at Girraween in the State of New South Wales did receive, harbour, maintain and assist the said Kevin GALLSection 349(1) Crimes Act (NSW)""
4Mr Bruce Gall submitted that had count 2 of the indictment been intended to encompass accessorial liability in respect of both murder and manslaughter, it would have either had to refer specifically to each of those offences rather than solely to murder, or, alternatively, that it ought have used a generic term such as unlawful homicide to signify that both murder and manslaughter were encapsulated. He also pointed to the fact that the only section relevantly referred to in the indictment was s 349(1) of the Act.
5Section 349 relevantly provides:
""(1) Every accessory after the fact to murder shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.""
6He pointed to the absence of reference in the indictment to s 350, which provides:
""An accessory after the fact to any other serious indictable offence is liable to imprisonment for 5 years, except where otherwise specifically enacted.""
7He referred me to cases where the Crown had charged an accused in the indictment with being accessory after the fact to murder and, in the alternative, to manslaughter (such as R v Walsh; R v Sharp [2004] NSWSC 111; 142 A Crim R 140) as being consistent with his submission that the alternative verdict should be expressly charged.8There appears to have been only a single occasion in New South Wales in which the point has been argued and determined: R v Jones (No. 9) [2007] NSWSC 1160; 173 A Crim R 331 (Jones). In Jones, the accused Lydia Jones, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder in the following terms:
""On 9 October 2005 at Kangy Angy in the State of New South Wales Adam Samuel Jones, Adam Jones, Samuel Jones and Elizabeth Jean Jones did murder William Smith and that Lydia Jones knowing the said Adam Samuel Jones, Adam Jones, Samuel Jones and Elizabeth Jean Jones to have committed the said serious indictable offence of murder of William Smith on 9 October 2005 at Kangy Angy in the state of New South Wales, did assist, maintain, harbour or receive the said Adam Samuel Jones, Adam Jones, Samuel Jones and Elizabeth Jean Jones.""
9In Jones, it was common ground that the jury should be informed that if they acquitted the principal offender of the charge of murder, then it would follow that Ms Jones should also be acquitted of being an accessory after the fact to murder. However, the Crown submitted that the jury should be informed that it was open to them, in those circumstances, to return a verdict of guilty of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. This course was opposed by Ms Jones.
10Buddin J rejected Ms Jones' submission as being contrary to ""long-established authority"" and referred to R v Richards (1877) 2 QBD 311 (Richards); R v Carter and Savage [1990] 2 Qd R 371; 47 A Crim R 55 (Carter and Savage) and Winning v R [2003] WASCA 245 (Winning). 
11Submissions were made on behalf of Ms Jones, which were substantially similar to those put on behalf of Mr Bruce Gall before me: namely that the alternative verdict would need to be specifically pleaded. However, Mr Levet, on behalf of Mr Bruce Gall, put the additional submission that, properly construed, s 349 of the Act operated to exclude the alternative verdict.
12In Richards, the prisoners charged with murder were found guilty of manslaughter. The two Richards were found guilty as accessories after the fact but the objection was made that the prisoners being charged in the indictment as accessories after the fact to murder could not be found guilty of having been accessories after the fact to manslaughter. Cockburn J (Mellor, Grove, Lindley and Hawkins JJ concurring) said, at 313:
""...a man charged with murder may be convicted of manslaughter, because murder involves the lesser charge of felonious homicide; so, for the same reason, one charged as accessory to murder may be convicted as accessory to manslaughter. The one thing follows from the other.""
13Richards was referred to in Carter and Savage, where the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal held:
""It is also a rule of long standing that, upon the trial of an accessory after the fact where the principal offence is said to be murder, the accessory is entitled to assert that the principal offender committed manslaughter only and although charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder he may be convicted of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter: Russell on Crime Vol. 1 p. 167, R. v. Greenacre (1837) 8 C. & P. 35; 173 E.R. 388, R. v. Richards (1877) 2 Q.B.D. 311.""
14Mr Levet, on behalf of Mr Bruce Gall, sought to distinguish these cases on the basis that Richards derived from the common law and Carter and Savage and Winning derived from States where the criminal law was codified. Furthermore, he submitted that I ought not follow Jones on the basis that it was incorrectly decided.
15Although Mr Levet's argument was based on the form of the indictment as well as the wording of the Act, I consider that it effectively amounted to a single argument. If the Act, properly construed, neither excludes an alternative verdict, nor requires it to be separately alleged, then there can be no proper objection to its availability when the indictment charges accessory after the fact to murder but not to manslaughter. The pleading point is, accordingly, intertwined with the question of statutory construction.
16Three of the States, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania have codified their criminal law. By contrast, New South Wales is a hybrid jurisdiction in the sense that the criminal law has not been codified; rather, the common law has been supplemented by legislation. Howard's Criminal Law (5th ed, Fisse) said of jurisdictions such as New South Wales:
""These statutes differ from the codes in that they are incomplete and presuppose the continued existence of the common law so far as consistent with their terms. This difference has two important consequences: the general principles of criminal responsibility derive in form as well as substance from the common law and common law offences continue in existence unless abrogated by statute.""  [Emphasis added.]
17The continued effect and application of the common law principles relating to the availability of alternative verdicts is evident from the scant specific provision made for them in the Act and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. For example, s 61Q of the Act provides for the availability of certain alternate verdicts in relation to sexual offences, including attempt. Section 162 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides for the alternative verdict of attempt on a trial for any indictable offence. Section 163 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that if a person who is tried for a serious indictable offence may be acquitted of that offence but found guilty of some other offence, the person is not liable to further prosecution on the same facts for that other offence.
18None of these provisions excludes the common law principle referred by Buddin J in Jones which was expressed in the following passage from R v Winner (1989) 39 A Crim R 180 at 181, per Roden J, with whom Hunt and Allen JJ agreed:
""It is trite law that quite apart from express statutory provisions, a jury may properly return a verdict of not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of a lesser offence. That is in accordance with what is frequently described as the principle that the greater includes the less. It is, however, subject to an important and stringent limitation. That is that such a verdict may only be returned if each element of the lesser offence of which the accused is convicted, is also an element of the greater offence with which he was charged, and has been alleged against him either expressly or by necessary implication in the indictment.""
19The jury's right to return an alternative verdict in such circumstances, gives rise to a correlative duty imposed on the trial judge to instruct a jury upon possible facts leading to an available outcome in addition to a count specifically charged: Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107. Just as manslaughter is a lesser offence to murder, the charge of accessory after the fact to manslaughter is a lesser offence to the charge of accessory after the fact to murder. So much is reflected in the different penalties for such offences (five years as opposed to 25 years).
20In my view, while the principle is of general application to all indictable offences, the position is a fortiori in the case of murder and manslaughter where historical concepts relating to the single crime of unlawful homicide apply (see R v Elfar [2000] NSWCCA 255; 115 A Crim R 64, per Sperling J). 
21The difference between murder and manslaughter is pre-eminently in the mind of the accused person. This has been found to have an effect on the mental element required to be established on a charge of accessory after the fact to murder or manslaughter.
22The matter was considered in R v Stone [1981] VR 737. At the end of the Crown case, the accused submitted that there was no case to answer on counts which included being an accessory after the fact to murder. The accused submitted that it was necessary for the Crown to prove knowledge by the accused at the relevant time of facts or acts which would allow it to be said that the crime of which the principal was guilty had in fact been committed to the knowledge of the accused at the time at which he was alleged to be acting as accessory.
23Crockett J said, of the charge of accessory after the fact to murder:
""The acts, or facts, which must be shown to have been within the knowledge of the accessory at the relevant time do not have to include matters that would prevent what otherwise would be murder from being murder or which would make the offence an offence less than murder. That is to say, it is sufficient if the acts, or facts, of which the accused is shown to have knowledge are such from which it could be said that he must have inferred that the principal had by a voluntary act shot and killed his wife and that he had done so with the intention either to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The evidence adduced by the Crown, including particularly the matters to which I have already referred in outlining the evidence, would allow an inference of such a kind to be found to have been drawn by the accused, so that the knowledge that he had at the relevant time was that the principal had committed the felony of murder. Of course, as matters then existed, it may have been that the shot was fired in self- defence, so as to reduce the crime to manslaughter. It may have been that the shot was fired under the influence of provocation, so as to reduce the crime to manslaughter. I do not think that it has to be shown by the Crown that the accused had knowledge of the acts, or facts, which would have allowed him to have drawn the inference that the offence committed was in fact something less than murder. It may have turned out to be so, although in the present case we now know it did not, because Eddington was convicted of the murder of his wife. But even if it had turned out that the offence was not murder but the lesser offence of manslaughter, the fact that in this case the accused need not have been shown to have knowledge other than that a felonious homicide had been committed by the principal with the intent of killing or causing grievous bodily harm is borne out by the case referred to in Tevendale's Case, supra [[1955] VLR 95], R v Richards (1877) 2 QBD 311.""
24Furthermore, in circumstances where it is accepted that an alternative verdict of manslaughter is available on a charge of murder and does not need to be separately charged in the indictment, it would be anomalous if a person charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder could not be convicted of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter unless he were specifically charged. As was said by Smart AJA in R v King [2004] NSWCCA 20; 59 NSWLR 515, at 532:
""While a criminal trial is an adversarial proceeding, the basis of the approach of Barwick CJ in Pemble is that the judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law and that this involves leaving a lesser offence to the jury, even if disclaimed by the parties, where conviction of the lesser offence is a viable outcome. It is in the public interest that alternative verdicts which are open on the evidence be considered so that a correct outcome is achieved.""
25For these reasons, I reject the submissions put on behalf of Mr Bruce Gall that the alternative verdict of accessory after the fact to manslaughter is not available in the event that Mr Kevin Gall is convicted of manslaughter.

		13 March 2013",2012-09-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760006,Environment Protection Authority v Shannongrove Pty Ltd (No 2) [2012] NSWLEC 202,"Judgment

1Following a trial, I have found Shannongrove Pty Ltd (Shannongrove) guilty of two offences against s 143(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (the POEO Act) (Environment Protection Authority v Shannongrove Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 162; (2010) 176 LGERA 31). It is convenient to refer to the judgment in which I determined guilt as ""the trial judgment"". A sentence hearing having been held, it is now necessary to determine the penalty to be imposed upon Shannongrove for the commission of each offence.

2It is unnecessary to repeat, in any detail, the background to and circumstances in which these offences were committed. However, having regard to the matters raised in the course of the sentence hearing, it will be necessary to refer to some of those facts recorded in the trial judgment.

3The evidence at trial established that Shannongrove had transported liquid waste from the waste processing facility at Eastern Creek, known as the UR-3R Facility, to a dairy farming property known as ""Marylands"" located at Bringelly. There, the liquid waste was unloaded from the Shannongrove's road tanker into a machine which, when towed behind a tractor, injected the liquid waste into the soil of a farm paddock. The liquid waste was considered by the farm operator as beneficial to both the level of soil moisture in the paddock where it was injected as well as acting as a fertiliser to aid the growing of pasture crops.

4The focus of evidence led by both parties on the sentence hearing conducted before me was directed to the environmental impact occasioned by reason of the soil injection of the waste liquid at Marylands. Shannongrove submitted that the result of soil injection undertaken by it was beneficial. The prosecutor contended to the contrary. That evidence and its consequence will be discussed in detail when I address the question of impact.

5However, I should record that before this evidence was called, it was submitted by Mr P J McEwen SC, on behalf of Shannongrove, that any evidence directed to impact was irrelevant. He submitted that the essence of the offence that I had found proved was the transportation of liquid waste from the UR-3R Facility to Marylands. Injection of the waste at Marylands was not an element of the offence, with the result that the impact of injecting the waste was irrelevant.

6I do not accept that submission. There are two reasons for so doing. First, subsection (3C) of s 143 of the POEO Act, in the form that it took during both charge periods, provided a defence to a charge brought under the section that the transported waste was not deposited at the place to which it was transported. While deposition of waste is not an ingredient of the offence (trial judgment at [75]), the provisions of s 143(3C) indicate that the deposit of waste at the site to which it is transported is relevant to be considered.

7Second, when determining the penalty to be imposed for an offence against the POEO Act, I am required to consider the matters identified in s 241 of that Act. By subsection (1)(a), I am bound to consider:

""(a)the extent of harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence,

... ""

8The application of the statutory provision clearly renders relevant evidence directed to the consequence of transporting waste to a place and there depositing that waste at that place which could not ""lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste"" (cf s 143(1) POEO Act).

9Apart from evidence directed to environmental impact, a number of affidavits were read directed to the motives of Shannongrove in undertaking the transport of liquid waste to Marylands, the good character of the principals or directors of Shannongrove and its actions following discovery of the offences in July 2006. Evidence was also given as to the beneficial effect which the injection of waste had on agricultural productivity.
 
Statutory considerations

10In determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed for the commission of these offences, it is necessary that account be taken of the purposes of sentencing, as those purposes are stated in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the CSP Act). Relevantly, those purposes include adequate punishment for the offence (a), making Shannongrove accountable for its actions (e), and denouncing the conduct of Shannongrove in committing the offences (f).

11Section 3A(b) of the CSP Act also identifies as one of the purposes of sentencing as the need for any sentence imposed to act as a deterrent. While, for reasons later given, I do not believe that deterrence of Shannongrove is a factor weighing heavily in the penalty to be imposed, the penalty does need to be sufficient such as to deter other persons from committing similar offences. This is also a matter on which I will make further observation later in this judgment.

12As I have earlier indicated, s 241(1) of the POEO Act requires that a number of matters be considered for the purpose of determining the penalty to be imposed for an offence against the Act. The section relevantly provides:

""241Matters to be considered in imposing penalty

(1)  In imposing a penalty for an offence against this Act or the regulations, the court is to take into consideration the following (so far as they are relevant):

(a)  the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence, 

(b)  the practical measures that may be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm,

(c)  the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence, 

(d)  the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence, 

(e)  whether, in committing the offence, the person was complying with orders from an employer or supervising employee.""

In the present case, it was not suggested that paragraph (e) had relevance.

13When determining penalty, the Court is also required to take into account any of the aggravating or mitigating factors identified in s 21A of the CSP Act, to the extent to which the facts allow and it would not be contrary to law so to do (s 21A(4)). Although it was initially submitted by the prosecutor that the offence was committed by Shannongrove for financial gain, an aggravating factor identified in s 21A(2)(o), that submission was subsequently withdrawn and no other aggravating factor identified. For its part, Shannongrove relies upon mitigating factors identified in s 21A(3). Those matters will be addressed in due course.

14After taking due account of the statutory provisions I have identified, the appropriate sentence is to be determined by an ""instinctive synthesis"" of all the relevant objective and subjective circumstances (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. As expressed by the plurality in Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [24]:

""It is a synthesis of competing features which attempts to translate the complexity of the human condition and human behaviour to the mathematics of units of punishment usually expressed in time or money.""

15The sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, considered in light of the objective circumstances. That upper limit of proportional punishment having been considered, the interplay of other factors will point to what is an appropriate sentence, having regard to all of the circumstances in the particular case. The objective circumstances, considered in the context of the principles that attend the imposition of a sentence or penalty, will also inform the lower limit of sentencing discretion.

Objective seriousness

16The maximum penalty imposed for an offence serves to indicate the seriousness with which an offence of the present kind is regarded by the Parliament. That maximum penalty is, in turn, a reflection of the seriousness for which the community regards commission of such an offence (Camilleri Stockfeeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 698).

17As indicated in the trial judgment, there were two charges brought against the defendant under s 143(1) by reason of amendment to the section during the period in which transportation of waste liquid was being undertaken by Shannongrove (at [9] - [12]). The maximum penalty for the first charge period, being from 28 January 2005 to 28 April 2006 (Summons 50033 of 2009) was $250,000 in the case of a corporation. The maximum penalty for the second charge period of approximately nine weeks from 1 May 2006 to 5 July 2006 (Summons 50034 of 2009) was $1M for a corporation. Given that the transportation of waste with which Shannongrove is charged took place predominantly during the period before the maximum penalty was increased, the principal focus should be upon the maximum penalty of $250,000 when determining the seriousness of the offence.

18However, that observation does not mean that the fourfold increase in the maximum penalty after 1 May 2006 should be ignored.

19While a maximum penalty of $250,000 is a significant penalty, the fourfold increase in that penalty from 1 May 2006 is to be taken as reflecting community standards at that time as to the seriousness with which the commission of such an offence is to be regarded. That increase reflects the intention of the legislature that the existing sentencing patterns are to move in an upward manner (R v Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519 per Hunt CJ at CL at 524. However, that observation does not have the consequence that for an offence committed following the increase in maximum penalty, there must be an increase in penalty for a particular offence by the same multiple as the maximum penalty was increased (Cabonne Shire Council v Environment Protection Authority [2001] NSWCCA 280; (2001) 115 LGERA 304 at [37]).

The need for a licence

20The gravamen of the offences for which Shannongrove has been found guilty is the transportation of waste to a facility that was not licensed under the POEO Act to receive that waste. Licensing of facilities under the POEO Act to receive waste plays a pivotal role in the regulatory scheme. As I observed in Environment Protection Authority v Hanna [2010] NSWLEC 98 at [38]:

"" ... the legislature has prescribed a highly regulated scheme for the disposal of waste. This is undoubtedly due to the harm to the environment, including risk to human health, which is, or may potentially be caused by the improper disposal of waste.""

21At all times during both charge periods, an environment protection licence was required in order to apply the transported liquid waste from the UR-3R Facility to the paddocks of Marylands. This requirement was the consequence of the provisions of s 48 and Pt 1 of Sch 1 to the POEO Act. As I determined in the trial judgment, the site did not fall within any of the listed exceptions to the classes of ""waste facilities"" identified in paragraph (1)(f) of Sch 1, nor did the waste have the characteristics identified in cl (3)(d1) under the item ""waste facilities"" that would have excepted Marylands from the need to be licensed.

22It follows that the statutory scheme regulating premises used for waste disposal was circumvented by the actions which Shannongrove took when depositing waste at Marylands. The capacity of the regulator either to refuse such activity outright or to control the manner in which it could be undertaken was denied. The risk of environmental harm was immediately apparent from this course of conduct. As Talbot J observed in Environment Protection Authority v Eco Cycle Materials Pty Ltd [2003] NSWLEC 63 at [19]:

"" ... there is a risk, even an invitation, for environmental harm to be caused by commencing a scheduled activity without all of the necessary statutory controls that flow through a licence being in place.""

23The constraints applicable to the use of Marylands as a place to which liquid waste from the UR-3R Facility might be taken and deposited by way of soil injection is exemplified by events that occurred after 5 July 2006. Following observations by investigators from the prosecutor of the delivery of liquid waste to Marylands on that day and the discussion had by those investigators with the road tanker driver, an employee of Shannongrove, further deliveries of waste to Marylands ceased. However, in anticipation that deliveries could be resumed at a later point in time, Shannongrove made application for an environment protection licence, enabling Marylands to be used as a ""waste facility"" for the receipt of liquid waste of the kind that had been transported to the site.

24Under cover of a letter dated 2 February 2007, the prosecutor provided to Shannongrove the draft of a licence that it was prepared to issue. That draft was forwarded to Shannongrove for consideration. 

25The draft licence was in evidence before me. A number of conditions of that draft licence demonstrate controls that are likely to have been imposed upon use of the waste liquid at Marylands had a licence been sought during the charge periods. Those conditions included the maximum concentration level of a large number of nominated pollutants at different discharge points on the property (L1); the maximum volume of liquid waste that could be deposited was not to exceed 350 kL/ha (L4.2) (compared to that applied by Shannongrove over an 18 month period which was in excess of 800 kL/ha); land having identified characteristics could not be used for application of liquid waste (O7); identified pollutants and their respective concentrations were required to be monitored and sampled at identified monitoring points (M2); samples of waste being delivered to the premises were required (M7) and six monthly monitoring of soil by sampling was required. In particular, the monitoring of soil pH and soil electrical conductivity along with a range of other soil chemical properties was required at two measuring points by condition M2.2(a).

26Thus, it can be seen that, although the prosecutor was prepared to issue a licence for the continued use of liquid waste from the UR-3R Facility at Marylands, the controls imposed upon its disposal and dispersal at that property were intended to ensure that disposal would be implemented in a manner that differed significantly from that in which liquid waste had been injected into the soil on the property during the charge periods. No analysis of the waste liquid had been undertaken by or on behalf of Shannongrove and no monitoring of the soil is recorded as having been undertaken during that period.

27The draft licence provided to Shannongrove for consideration was not, in fact, taken up by it at any point in time. Moreover, no liquid waste was taken to Marylands by Shannongrove after 5 July 2006.

Harm to the environment

28In the trial judgment I found that 5,639.31 tonnes of liquid waste had been transported by Shannongrove to Marylands and there injected into the soil at the direction of the farm manager. I also described the manner in which that liquid waste was generated. In short, it is the liquid waste product of the processes undertaken at the UR-3R Facility which in turn processes municipal solid waste from the local government areas of Fairfield and Blacktown. This waste constituted the kerbside ""garbage"" collected within those areas. It was ""garbage"" or waste not identified by the occupier of premises, or not separated by the occupiers, as recyclable material. A significant proportion of its content was putrescible waste.

29The expert evidence led at the sentence hearing indicated disagreement as to whether environmental harm was occasioned to Marylands and its environs by the injection of liquid waste over the charge periods. The principal protagonists in this regard were Dr Brian Murphy, called by the prosecutor and Dr Peter Bacon, on behalf of Shannongrove. Other experts provided affidavit evidence directed to the topic, or rather, aspects of it, but it was deemed sufficient by the parties to focus upon the evidence of Drs Murphy and Bacon.

30Dr Murphy is a soil scientist whose expertise includes the interpretation of soil tests, measurement and management of soil structure, the assessment and management of sodic soil and the mapping and management of saline soils. Dr Bacon is an environmental scientist whose expertise includes the interpretation of soil and water analysis, the assessment of soil 'health' and predicative modelling of soil and water conditions. His work has also included the re-use of effluent on land. 

31The focus of the debate between these experts was upon the accumulation of salts in the soil strata at Marylands and the environmental impact which that accumulation, if any, would have. There were two sources of data from which their consideration commenced. The first was a soil landscape map for the area and the second waste liquid and soil samples first taken by officers of the prosecutor on 6 July 2006. The soil landscape map for the area was used to identify the expected characteristics of the soil at Marylands. The general features of the soil within the Marylands site are described in the following way:


(a)  the surface soils are non-saline, non-sodic, non-dispersible and acidic;


(b)  the subsoils are becoming saline, are acidic, non-sodic and non-dispersible; and


(c)  the deep subsoils are becoming strongly saline.

Although these characteristics were identified by Dr Murphy, I do not understand Dr Bacon to have disagreed with them.

32The second source of data were the results of liquid waste and soil tests taken by the prosecutor's investigators in July 2006. Those tests involved chemical analysis of samples of liquid taken from the delivery tanker driven by Shannongrove's employee on 5 July 2006; samples and analysis of liquid taken from the waste water tank at the UR-3R Facility on that same day and the analysis of soil samples taken at and in the vicinity of Marylands some days later. Soil samples were taken from the area on Marylands into which liquid waste had been injected and also from an area approximately 1km away that had not been used for injection of liquid waste. The latter sample was used as a control sample.

33While the sampling and testing undertaken in July 2006 was not undertaken by either of the two experts called before me, they had each inspected Marylands in 2009 and taken soil samples for analysis from similar locations within that property. Their test soil results for 2009 are, unsurprisingly, similar.

34Each of Dr Murphy and Dr Bacon focused upon the extent to which soil salinity at Marylands had been affected by introduction of the liquid waste. In the context of the various test results, the extent of soil salinity was reflected in the electrical conductivity measured in the samples. The measure of electrical conductivity was expressed in the various test results as a measure of decisiemens per metre (dS/m).

35Dr Murphy identified the analysis of the control soil sample, being that to which no liquid waste had been applied, as revealing low salinity, measured as being 0.13dS/m. He opined that those results were consistent with the properties of the soils identified for that soil on the soil landscape map. By contrast the mean electrical conductivity of soil samples taken from Marylands in July 2006 showed a mean level to be 2.08dS/m with a maximum of 4.2dS/m and minimum of 0.46dS/m. Dr Murphy considered that these levels showed high to very high salinity and were inconsistent with the salinity levels in soils identified for the site in the soil landscape map. He considered that these high levels were consistent with properties of the liquid waste that had been applied to the area, that liquid waste having a mean electrical conductivity level of 34dS/m.

36While Dr Bacon does not directly address these opinions, his criticisms are more broadly based. He challenges the extent of soil sampling as being sufficient; indicates that samples taken from the tanker at Marylands and the waste water tank at the UR-3R Facility were unrepresentative and asserts that the background levels of salinity at Marylands are not sufficiently known in order to draw the conclusions drawn by Dr Murphy. In his opinion, land clearing more than a century ago in order to accommodate farming activities as well as agricultural practices adopted over that period, could well have affected soil salinity so as to elevate its level to something approaching that measured in the soil samples taken in July 2006. He is unable to determine from the information available whether the control soil sample taken by the prosecutor's representatives represent the salinity of soil in the relevant paddocks of Marylands immediately prior to the introduction of liquid waste.

37If the 2006 data represented all that was available there would be substance in that criticism. However, the results of tests taken in 2009 indicate a considerable reduction in the conductivity then measured. The sample results recorded in Dr Murphy's evidence indicate levels in the upper soil profile and on the higher ground of the land that had been injected with liquid waste as ranging between 0.28dS/m and 0.14dS/m. Based on those figures, it is apparent that salinity had fallen between July 2006 and February 2009 when the latter samples were collected, a period coincident with the cessation of liquid waste injection. 

38In his evidence, Dr Bacon was critical of the liquid waste sampling taken from the tanker delivering waste to Marylands on 5 July and sampling of the contents of the waste water tank at the UR-3R Facility on that same day. It was from the latter tank that Shannongrove's tanker was seen to load the waste taken to Marylands earlier in the day. Dr Bacon refers to the wide disparity in the measurement of analytes as between those obtained from the tanker liquid and those obtained from the waste water tank. 

39However, that criticism was somewhat undermined in the course of Dr Bacon's cross-examination. He accepted that the preponderance of salts in the liquid waste was likely to be reflected in the analysis of total dissolved solids. Analysis of the waste water tank at the UR-3R Facility indicated that the total dissolved solids yielded a measure of 22,000mg/l. The same analysis of waste liquid taken from the Shannongrove tanker at Marylands was 21,333.3mg/l.

40Dr Bacon's attention was also drawn to the analysis of waste liquid from the same two sources that reflected electrical conductivity. The measure in the waste liquid from the UR-3R Facility was analysed as being 36dS/m while liquid from the tanker was analysed as being 34dS/m. Faced with these comparisons, Dr Bacon conceded that at least on the day of sampling, the liquid taken to Marylands for soil injection had a salinity level which was representative of that same level in the waste water storage tank at the UR-3R Facility. Nonetheless, he observed that those levels were likely to vary given the variation in the waste material brought to the facility for treatment.

41The third broad area of criticism made by Dr Bacon related to the extent of sampling undertaken both in 2006 and again by Dr Murphy in 2009. Standards for testing published by the prosecutor for testing of contaminated sites, required many more samples to be taken than those that had been taken in the present case. While the prosecutor sought to draw a distinction from the number of tests required for contaminated sites, usually required in order to determine the extent of remediation to be undertaken, and those taken in the present case, there is some substance in this criticism.

42The area within Marylands that had been the subject of liquid waste injection was a little over six hectares. Relatively few samples were taken over this area for soil analysis although Dr Murphy considered them sufficient to gain an understanding of the soil profile in 2006.

43The criticism directed to the small number of soil samples is exemplified by the tests taken in 2009. Only four sites were selected by Dr Murphy for soil testing. Two of those were in a upper area of the paddock on which liquid waste had been injected while two were in the low lying areas in which pasture was sparse or bare and which were described by both experts as being either ""scorched"" or ""hotspots"". While the level of salinity in the two samples collected from the upper areas showed 2009 levels that I have earlier recorded, Dr Bacon observed that their limited number did not enable a conclusion to be drawn as to the areal extent of salinity at those levels, relatively low as they were.

44By comparison with the levels recorded at the upper levels in 2009, the level of salinity in the scorched areas or hotspots was, by comparison, elevated. The level of electrical conductivity at one such area, described as Site 3, was in the range in the upper soil profile of between 0.73dS/m and 0.52dS/m. At the other site, described as Site 4, the upper level range was between 0.51dS/m and 0.22dS/m.

45Dr Murphy accepted that there had been a reduction in soil salinity between 2005 and 2009. Elevated salinity levels have the propensity to diminish the agricultural productivity of the affected land. While he accepted that this affect had diminished following cessation of liquid waste injection, the level of salinity at the scorched areas or hotspots indicated that the affect of elevated salinity was still being experienced. He indicated that these levels were indicative of an accumulation of salts, some of which may have infiltrated the soil strata and moved further down-slope or entered the groundwater system, ultimately affecting the quality of that groundwater, particularly as it entered local streams.

46Dr Bacon did not accept this conclusion. He acknowledged that the existence of hotspots in 2009 was indicative of elevated salinity in those areas. However, both the tests and his own observations had indicated that the aggregate of all areas so affected was a total of about 30m2 out of an area of approximately 64,000m2 that had been treated with the liquid waste transported by Shannongrove. His evidence also indicated that when he returned to the site in 2010, those areas that in the previous year had been identified as scorched or hotspots no longer appeared.

47Dr Bacon also relied upon evidence from the farm manager as to the productivity of the area that had been treated with waste. That evidence was, in summary, that the paddocks were highly productive with increased crop yields compared with other areas of the property. Further, when the area was grazed by dairy cattle, higher milk production than had previously been the case resulted. Photographs produced in evidence revealed the lushness of the area by comparison with other areas of the property.

48In the face of that evidence, Dr Murphy accepted that the treated area appeared to be highly productive. However, he opined that such an observation was not inconsistent with some accumulation of salt within the soil profile, even if it was at a depth that did not impair the growth of pasture crops. He indicated that such salts are not lost, but rather move within the soil profile. While those salts may be out of the root zone of crops, the existence of salts within the soil may have an impact if, in the future, the land should be differently used. If used for the erection of a building, the existence of those salts could have a deleterious effect upon foundation material placed in the soil.
49Ultimately, Dr Bacon accepted that the scorched areas or hotspots observed in 2009, small in area though they were, did demonstrate a residual impact from the salts introduced to the soil by the injection of liquid waste (Tcpt 22: 4-10). Nonetheless, he would not accept, in the absence of further testing, that the residual impact would extend beyond that area. He accepted that from other recorded observations, the initial impact of liquid waste injection may have detrimentally affected pasture crops. This, he suggested, was no different to the application of fertiliser to pasture at a level which may initially cause some setback but after a short time increases agricultural productivity, as had occurred at Marylands. Overall, therefore, it was his opinion that application of the liquid waste was beneficial rather than detrimental.

50My consideration of all this evidence leads me to be satisfied to the requisite standard that the liquid fertiliser applied to Marylands during the charge periods did elevate the level of salinity in the soils to which it was applied on Marylands. The surface effect of this salinity upon cropping of the property was short term, with the level of agricultural productivity quickly returning to most of the area. There was a residual impact that extended to lower lying areas through to 2009, but in the absence of more soil test data than is available, the evidence does not establish that the areal extent was significant.

51I accept the possibility that elevated salt levels may be present in the lower soil strata, although these would appear to be levels at which the soil profile is either becoming saline or is strongly saline. I am therefore unable to conclude that there is likely long term environmental harm. 

52In the result, I find that the injection of liquid waste transported by Shannongrove to Marylands and injected by or on behalf of Shannongrove to the soil had short term environmental impact, having largely abated by February 2009. While it does not appear to have created any adverse effect upon the agronomic environment of Marylands, there remains the possibility of some effect upon the broader environment, although that effect cannot, on the evidence, be described as ""likely"". In short, the consequence of injecting liquid was in the low range of environmental harm.

53In reaching this conclusion, it has not been necessary for me to adjudicate upon the debate between the experts as to the prediction of likely harm had the liquid waste injection of soil continued beyond 5 July 2006. Shannongrove took it upon itself to cease its activity at Marylands; it applied for an environment protection licence in contemplation of resuming that activity, but ultimately neither resumed the activity nor pursued its licence application. It therefore seems to me that, for the purpose of determining penalty, I should not contemplate the consequence of events that did not occur. 

Practical measures

54Shannongrove not only transported liquid waste from the UR-3R Facility, but also took responsibility for soil injection of that liquid waste at Marylands (trial judgment at [48]). It was therefore within its capacity to refrain from transporting the waste and carrying out the soil injection exercise until an environment protection licence had been obtained for the disposal of that liquid waste at Marylands. Any doubt as to whether a licence for that purpose was required could readily have been resolved by enquiry of the prosecutor. No such enquiry was made. 

55It follows that practical measures were available to Shannongrove to control or mitigate such harm as was occasioned by the disposal of liquid waste at Marylands.

Foreseeability of harm
 

56The prosecutor submits that such harm as was occasioned to the environment, in accordance with the finding earlier made by me, was harm that was reasonably foreseeable. As I understand its submission, Shannongrove denies that this was so. In substance, its denial is founded upon two factors.

57First, it relied upon the definition of ""fertiliser"" in the Fertilisers Act 1985 which, it was submitted, occasioned the belief that the waste liquid was suitable for injecting into soil used for agricultural purposes. The definition to which reference is made was contained in s 3A of the Fertilisers Act in the following terms:

""(1)  For the purposes of this Act, fertiliser means:

(a)  a substance that consists of or contains nitrogen, phosphorous or potassium (or any combination of nitrogen, phosphorous or potassium) and is manufactured, represented, sold or used as a means for directly or indirectly supplying nutriment for the purpose of enhancing the development, productivity, quality or reproductive capacity of vegetation, or 

(b)  any other substance that the Minister declares, by an order published in the Gazette, to be a fertiliser for the purposes of this Act.""

58Whatever may have been the subjective belief of the directors of Shannongrove, objectively judged, the fact that the definition existed in the Fertilisers Act did not militate against foreseeability of harm from the liquid waste transported by Shannongrove and used at Marylands. No evidence was given as to the awareness by the company of the chemical composition of the liquid waste nor is it explained why a substance that may meet the definition in the Fertilisers Act was thought to avoid the necessity to observe the provisions of the POEO Act.

59The second basis upon which Shannongrove claims that harm was not foreseeable is a letter from the Department of Environment and Conservation dated 17 June 2005 to Mr P Coffey, a director of Resource Recovery Management Pty Ltd. That letter was provided to Shannongrove on 5 July 2005. The letter identifies amendments to the Protection of the Environment Operations (Waste) Regulation 2005 pertaining to land application of certain wastes. The letter indicates that the Regulation was due to commence on 1 December 2005. It also indicates that the Regulation had been developed ""to protect land, food and the environment from contamination by the inappropriate application of wastes to land under the guise of fertiliser."" The letter further observes that the amending Regulation would not place restrictions ""on lawfully sold fertiliser products that are compliant with the requirements of the Fertilisers Act 1985, including contaminant levels"".

60Reliance upon that letter would not seem to me to provide a reasonable basis upon which to conclude that use of the liquid waste from the UR-3R Facility at Marylands did not create any foreseeable risk of harm to the environment. First, it is to be noticed that at the time at which this letter was received, let alone the time at which it was stated that the new regulation would operate, the transportation and injection of the liquid waste in question was already being undertaken by Shannongrove. The first charge that I have found proved relates to the period commencing on 28; January 2005, that is almost six months before receipt of the letter upon which some reliance is placed. Second, as the explanatory material annexed to the letter indicates, the prohibition upon use of any residue waste does not apply if it is waste ""sold as a soil improving agent (fertiliser or liming material) or trace element product within the meaning of the Fertilisers Act 1985 and complies with prescribed maximum contaminant levels."" There is no evidence that Shannongrove had any understanding of the ""contaminant levels"" within the liquid waste nor does the evidence establish that the liquid waste was ""sold as a soil improving agent"". On the contrary, Shannongrove was paid to remove the liquid as waste from the UR-3R Facility (trial judgment at [50]-[53]).

61I accept the submission of the prosecutor that Shannongrove could reasonably have foreseen harm likely to be caused to the environment by committing the offence that it did. Having regard to the process involved in waste treatment at the UR-3R Facility and the nature of the raw material for that waste, coupled with the absence of any analysis of the liquid that it was transporting and applying to land, it was foreseeable that the liquid might harm the soil into which it was being injected.

Control over causes

62Shannongrove had control over the causes giving rise to the offences of which it has been found guilty.

63As I understand the submissions on behalf of Shannongrove, it accepts that this is so, although it refers to the understanding held by its directors that the holding of a licence for disposal of liquid waste at Marylands was not required, given the beneficial application of this liquid waste to the land in order to improve agricultural productivity.

State of mind and reason for offending

64The offences with which Shannongrove has been charged are offences of strict liability with the consequence that the state of mind of the offender is not relevant to the determination of guilt. Nonetheless, the offender's state of mind and reasons for committing the offence are circumstances to which regard may be had in determining the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence (Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [123] and [140]). 

65Lengthy affidavit evidence was received from Neville Gilmartin who, with his wife, are the directors of Shannongrove. Mr Gilmartin was cross-examined on the evidence that he gave during the course of the sentencing hearing. Mr Gilmartin indicated that he had been transporting waste by road tanker for the past 16 years. The transporting of waste by road tanker over that period had, according to his evidence, included the transportation of liquids from ""virtually every food factory in and around Sydney"". His road tanker was, itself, licensed to transport waste (trial judgment at [42]). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that Mr Gilmartin had a general awareness that a regulatory scheme operated to control the transport and disposition of waste.

66Mr Gilmartin relies upon a number of matters said to support his understanding that no licence was required for the disposition of liquid waste at Marylands. I have already referred to one of those matters being the email communication to Mr Coffey in June 2005.

67Reliance was placed by Mr Gilmartin upon guidelines published by the prosecutor entitled ""Environmental Guidelines: Assessment, Classification and Management of Liquid and Non-Liquid Wastes"" (the Guidelines). Within the Guidelines the following statement is made:

""If the waste is assessed as a non-controlled aqueous liquid waste, a licence is usually not required.""

It is accepted by the prosecutor that the waste liquid in question is appropriately categorised as a non-controlled aqueous liquid waste. 

68The Guidelines also make general statements as to the desirability of wastes being used for beneficial purposes. However, there are a number of statements made in the Guidelines that identify the need for assessment of liquid being transported and taken to a site for disposal in order to determine whether a licence is required. Moreover, the statement that I have earlier quoted from the Guidelines is a qualified statement, there being no evidence to suggest that Mr Gilmartin sought from the prosecutor any advice as to whether the particular liquid waste that he was transporting and injecting at Marylands did attract the need for a licence when disposed of at that site.

69Mr Gilmartin also identified, as informing his understanding that no licence was required for Marylands, the fact that the liquid waste that he was transporting was part of the process that produced the compost sold by the UR-3R Facility for use of land that, to his understanding, was not licensed under the POEO Act. He believed that the compost retained a component of the liquid that he was transporting. 

70Mr Gilmartin also gave evidence as to his belief that the soil injection of the waste liquid at Marylands provided agricultural benefit to that property. His belief was founded upon experience that included the observation of the apparent improvement in pastures following soil injection of the liquid.

71The prosecutor submits that there is some evidence suggesting an awareness on the part of Mr Gilmartin of the need for an environment protection licence in order to dispose of liquid waste at Marylands. First, it refers to a letter dated 30 October 2003 from the prosecutor to the directors of Applied Soil Technology Pty Ltd. Mr Gilmartin and his wife were directors of that company at the time at which it was written. That letter drew attention to the provisions of the POEO Act and indicated, in terms, that within the Sydney Metropolitan Area or Extended Regulated Area the application to land of non-controlled aqueous liquid waste required that both a development consent and an environment protection licence be held in respect of the premises to which the liquid waste was applied. Reference was made to the provisions of the schedule to the POEO Act. While acknowledging that he was a director of that company, Mr Gilmartin denied having seen the contents of that letter until it was shown to him in the course of an interview by investigators from the prosecutor in 2008.

72The prosecutor also relies upon a letter dated 4 March 2005 from the Department of Environment and Conservation and addressed to Mr Gilmartin and his wife at their address in Silverdale. The letter addresses an allegation that liquid waste had been disposed of ""via land application"" at the Silverdale property of Mr and Mrs Gilmartin. Relevantly, the letter stated that under the POEO Act the application of non-controlled aqueous liquid waste to land within the Sydney Metropolitan and Extended Regulated Area required an environment protection licence for the premises to which such liquid waste was taken. 
73Although it was acknowledged by Mr Gilmartin that the address to which the letter was directed was his address, he denied ever having received that letter. He states that it was first seen when shown to him in the course of investigating the current offences in 2008.

74The prosecutor accepts that it cannot establish to the requisite standard that these letters were seen by Mr Gilmartin or his wife prior to 2008. They are relied upon only to the extent to which they identify the likely response of the prosecutor had enquiry been made at the time at which those letters were written as to the need for a licence to dispose of the liquid waste that was being transported by Shannongrove to Merrylands.

75In a letter dated 18 July 2005 a soil scientist at the Sydney Environmental and Soil Laboratory wrote to Mr Michael Bonanno who was the technical manager of the UR-3R Facility. The purpose of the letter was to provide test results for metals in the liquid waste being transported from the Facility. In the course of that letter reference was made to recent correspondence from the prosecutor indicating that the only waste ""that may be managed to land"" without a licence was ""Group B Food Waste"" which was also non-controlled aqueous liquid waste. The author stated that in his view the prosecutor was wrong in that regard but concluded by saying:

"" ... before you assume that my opinion is correct I urge you to rely on your own qualified legal advice.""

I infer that Mr Gilmartin was shown that letter shortly after its receipt by Mr Bonanno.

76However, as the prosecutor points out, the opinion of the author of that letter is qualified by the statement that independent advice should be sought. Although reference to that letter was made in the affidavit evidence of Mr Gilmartin, it is not apparent from the totality of the evidence given by him the extent to which, if at all, he relied upon that qualified advice.

77The prosecutor also points to the evidence indicating that in October 2003 Shannongrove sought a ruling from the prosecutor as to the classification of some waste described as ""greasetrap waste"" (Exhibit O). This enquiry of the Environment Protection Authority is recorded as having been made on behalf of Shannongrove by Dr Bacon. The fact that an enquiry was then thought appropriate is contrasted with the absence of any enquiry by or on behalf of Shannongrove in relation to the liquid waste transported to Marylands from the UR-3R Facility.

78I accept that Mr and Mrs Gilmartin held a belief that an environment protection licence for disposal of liquid waste at Marylands was unnecessary during the charge periods. However, viewed objectively, there was sufficient material which came to their notice which, together with the experience of Shannongrove as a transporter of waste over many years, reasonably warranted an enquiry of the regulatory authority as to whether a licence was, in law, required. No such enquiry was made.

79I do not overlook the fact that the transportation of liquid waste to Marylands during the charge period was undertaken for reward. However, evidence led before me indicated that, in fact, little profit was made from this enterprise and the prosecutor expressly disavowed a submission that commercial gain, however small, should be regarded as an aggravating factor.

Conclusion as to objective seriousness 
 

80Having regard to all of the matters which I have addressed, I conclude that the objective seriousness of the offence is low.

Subjective considerations

81Shannongrove has not been convicted of any prior offence. That is a mitigating factor to be taken into account when determining an appropriate sentence: s 21A(3)(e) of the CSP Act.

82A number of character testimonials have been tendered directed to the good character of Mr and Mrs Gilmartin as well as the responsible conduct of Shannongrove in the conduct of its business affairs. Although none of the testimonials tendered referred to the conviction of Shannongrove for the present offences, evidence was given by Mr Gilmartin that each of those providing a testimonial reference had been informed of that fact. The prosecutor did not challenge that evidence.

83Each of those testimonials referred to a lengthy period of association with Shannongrove and its directors and each speak highly of them. I accept them as being relevant to the determination of penalty.

84In the context of good character or responsibility, reference must be made to the fact that Shannongrove voluntarily ceased the transportation of waste to Marylands following the events of 5 July 2006. Its subsequent application for a licence is also relevant in this context. Further detail in respect of each of those matters has earlier been recorded but I identify them as again being relevant in the present context.

85As would be apparent from the facts earlier stated in relation to the state of mind of Mr and Mrs Gilmartin, they believed that their actions were not contrary to law. However, Mr Gilmartin has stated that had he known that the transportation of liquid waste to Marylands was unlawful he would never have undertaken the exercise and states that he was sorry it had occurred. I accept that evidence as being truthful.

86Once the prosecutor's investigations into Shannongrove's activities were made known to Mr Gilmartin, it is apparent that he co-operated with the prosecutor in meeting the requests made of him during the course of investigation. Records sought were provided and assistance was given to the operator of the UR-3R Facility from whom information was sought in the course of this investigation.

87I should also make reference to evidence given by the manager of Marylands. He confirmed that the areas of the property treated with the liquid waste had provided higher crop yields, higher milk production and had resulted in a saving of $50,000 to $60,000 per annum in fertiliser costs. This evidence supports the belief of Mr Gilmartin as to the beneficial use of the liquid waste.

Appropriate penalty
Specific deterrence

88The fact that Shannongrove has operated for a considerable period of time in the transportation of waste and its application to land would suggest the need for specific deterrence in the present case. As the prosecutor submitted, it would have been a simple matter to make an enquiry of the statutory regulator as to whether an environment protection licence was required to transport waste to Marylands and inject that waste into the soil.

89So much must be accepted. However, I am satisfied that the prosecution of the present proceedings against Shannongrove has been salutary for it. The likelihood of reoccurrence of a similar offence is remote.

90In this regard I also note the evidence from Mr Gilmartin as to the damage to personal reputation that has been suffered because of publicity given to the trial judgment. Publicity of that judgment in some of the media was both selective and exaggerated in its reference to the events that occurred. It seems to me to be unlikely that Shannongrove would wish to attract to itself publicity of that kind in the future.
91Specific deterrence will therefore play only a small part in determination of an appropriate penalty.

General deterrence

92My earlier reference to the provisions of s 3A of the CSP Act indicates that a purpose to be considered in imposing a sentence is the prevention of crime by deterring others from committing similar offences. Breaches of the regulatory regime established by the POEO Act must be recognised as breaches for which significant penalties may be imposed. However, this does not mean that Shannongrove should bear an unfair burden of community education (Walden v Hensler [1987] HCA 54; (1987) 163 CLR 561 at 570).

Consistency in sentencing

93Regard should be had to comparable cases from which guidance can be obtained. However, as the prosecutor submitted, caution must be exercised in considering other cases because of the inevitable disparity between subjective and objective circumstances applicable to those cases, compared to the same circumstances found to exist in the case under consideration. It was also accepted by the prosecutor that the sentencing statistics available from the JIRS database were so limited as to provide no real assistance to the Court when determining the penalty in the present case. The same applies to those cases to which I have been referred, the extent of their assistance being that the imposition of a fine is appropriate in the present case.

Costs

94The prosecutor seeks an order for payment of its costs pursuant to s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Although, as I understand it, Shannongrove accepts that costs are payable by it, it has not agreed as to the quantum of those costs. The prosecutor's estimate is $93,500. I will assume, without determining, that the costs to which the prosecutor is entitled will approximate that sum.

95The prosecutor also seeks an order pursuant to s 248 of the POEO Act for payment of its investigation costs. The costs claimed are in the sum of $24,724.76. As I understand it, Shannongrove accepts that a sum on account of investigation costs should be paid but considers that it should not be required to pay the amount claimed because of what it perceives to be shortcomings in the soil and waste water test results. No alternate sum is proffered and I see no basis upon which to reduce the quantum of investigation costs claimed.

96I bear in mind that costs ordered to be paid may properly be taken into account when determining the amount of any fine to be imposed upon Shannongrove (Environment Protection Authority v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 at [78]; Environment Protection Authority v Hardt [2007] NSWLEC 284 at [66]). As will be apparent from the preceding paragraphs, the two items of costs sought by the prosecutor will be substantial and while no mathematical exercise is called for, they will be considered when determining the appropriate penalty.

Conclusion as to penalty

97As I have earlier indicated, the imposition of an appropriate penalty or penalties in the present matters is made more difficult by the fact that although there is a single course of conduct, there are two separate charge periods for which a different maximum penalty was provided. The imposition of penalties must also take account of the fact that for all but two months of the total period to which the charges relate, it was the lower maximum penalty that was applicable.

98Undertaking the instinctive synthesis required to determine penalty, I consider that an appropriate penalty to be imposed for the offence relating to the first charge period to be a fine of $30,000. The appropriate penalty; to be imposed for the offence committed during the second charge period is the sum of $20,000. However, these prospective penalties do not take account of the principle of totality. It is to the application of that principle that I now turn.

Totality principle

99The prosecutor accepts that the principle of totality ""applies with particular rigour"" in the circumstances of this case in order to ensure ""that the fact of there being two charges does not inflate the penalty that the court would otherwise impose having regard to the totality of what was, in effect, a single episode of offending conduct.""

100The prosecutor fairly submitted that this was a case in which it was inappropriate to impose ""a crushing penalty"". It acknowledged that Shannongrove was a family company and that in committing the offences of which it has been found guilty it did not intend to harm the environment. 

101If I was to apply the aggregate penalty assessed for the offences on an individual basis it would be the sum of $50,000. I consider that this exceeds the appropriate penalty for a single course of conduct, particularly taking into account both the legal and investigation costs for which Shannongrove will be liable. I also take into account the fact that a publication order will be made.

102In the result I consider that an aggregate penalty of $35,000 would be appropriate, involving a reduction in the penalty for the first charge period to $20,000 and a reduction in the penalty for the second charge period to $15,000. The imposition of that aggregate penalty would, to my mind, sufficiently reflect the total criminality of Shannongrove's conduct but, at the same time, would not be so small as to undermine the confidence in the administration of criminal justice by failing to address those principles of sentencing that I have earlier identified.

Publication order

103The prosecutor seeks an order pursuant to s 250(1)(a) of the POEO Act requiring that Shannongrove's conviction and the penalty imposed be disclosed in both a local newspaper and trade magazine.

104The making of an order for publication of conviction for an offence under the POEO Act is sanctioned by s 250(1)(a) of that Act. As I understand its submission, Shannongrove does not contest the making of such an order but disagrees with the prosecutor as to the form and size which a publication notice should take. The competing submissions have been considered by me and I have determined that the notice should be published in the form annexed to these reasons and of the size indicated in the orders that I make.

Orders

105The orders that I make are as follows:

CONVICTION FOR WASTE OFFENCES

On 5 September 2012, Shannongrove Pty Ltd was convicted of offences in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.

Shannongrove Pty Ltd pleaded not guilty but the Court found the company had contravened the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. Between January 2005 and July 2006, the company transported approximately 5600 tonnes of liquid waste to a dairy farm in Bringelly, NSW, which was not then licensed to receive the waste. The liquid waste was injected into the soil at the property.

The liquid waste was generated during the processing of municipal solid waste at a waste treatment facility at Eastern Creek.

Shannongrove Pty Ltd was fined $35,000 for the offences.

The company was also ordered to place this notification and to pay the Environment Protection Authority's costs.

This advertisement has been paid for by Shannongrove Pty Ltd following an order of the Land and Environment Court

2760007,R v Blair [2012] NSWDC 188,"SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR: Kay Blair is a drug courier. She does not have the excuses offered by many other drug couriers who appear in this Court. She did not get involved in bringing drugs into Australia because of gambling debts. She cannot say she had a poor upbringing with bad role models. Instead she had every opportunity offered to her and so what made her make the decision to get herself involved in serious drug trafficking is something of a puzzle.

2She was born in New Zealand and moved to South East Asia after she formed a relationship with a man. That relationship ended and she formed another relationship. From the moment she entered that relationship her partner began asking her to get herself involved in drug trafficking. She said that she resisted his offers and resisted his suggestion until, he was deported from Thailand to Nigeria, his country of birth. Then, she says, she finally gave in to pressure. 

3She met up with other friends of her partner who gave her some pellets. She concealed them by swallowing some, inserting some in her vagina and inserting some in her clothing. She could not conceal them all so she gave some back. She then travelled to Australia. 

4The attention of Customs officers was drawn to her. When they began questioning her their suspicions were clearly aroused. She told a strange story and had nothing to back up what she was saying about the purposes of her trip to Australia and other earlier trips she had undertaken. They conducted a frisk search which proved negative, but suspicions were so highly aroused that Customs officers said that they would detain her for an internal examination. 

5It was at that moment that Ms Blair stopped telling lies and began to tell the truth. She told Customs officers that she had concealed some packages. They were eventually recovered. They were found to contain heroin, pure weight of just over 200 grams. She has been in custody since that date.

6Ms Blair was brought up on a dairy farm in New Zealand by parents who clearly love and support her. She has siblings. Neither of them have been involved in crime in any way. She left home to go to university and almost completed a degree. She has only one subject to complete before she will complete that degree. 

7There is nothing in her background to explain why she did what she did, apart perhaps from a suggestion made by a psychologist that Ms Blair is easily led. There are certainly some circumstances in Ms Blair's life which would suggest the accuracy of that assertion. She moved countries, and changed religion because of a relationship she had entered into and then decided to commit this most serious criminal offence because of pressure put on her by a person in a different relationship. Maybe that is what explains Ms Blair's decision to commit this serious crime.

8She has no prior criminal convictions. Of course, most drug couriers are in the same boat. Those higher up the drug distribution and trafficking hierarchy often use people with no prior convictions as couriers because it makes it less likely that their importations will be discovered by the authorities. She is now in custody in Australia and will of course serve the remainder of her sentence of imprisonment here. She has no family in Australia. She has no friends in Australia. Her parents have visited her in custody and plan to do so in the future, but they will not be able to visit her as often as they would like and so Ms Blair will do her time in custody relatively isolated. On the other hand there are many worse off than she is. She does speak English, in contrast to many other drug traffickers who are sentenced in these Courts. On top of that of course there is this circumstance, Ms Blair knew full well what she was doing when she arrived in Australia and she can hardly be heard to complain too much if a consequence of her voluntary decision to do what she did means that she will spend some time apart from her family and friends.

9Ms Blair is certainly a young woman who is capable of achieving something in her life. She has plans for the future and, as I mentioned earlier, retains the support of her family. She thus has good prospects of rehabilitation which is an important matter in assessing the sentence to impose upon her.

10She gave evidence that it was not until she went into custody that the reality of the miseries of drug use became apparent to her. Her evidence was that, and I paraphrase, on an intellectual basis she knew that drugs were bad and they cause problems for people, but this was not brought home to her until she experienced it for herself first hand. I can understand that attitude. Getting close up to drug use is an eye opening experience. Nothing can really prepare anyone for close observation of the life of a drug addict. Whilst intellectually it is easy to say that drug use is bad, I can understand how Ms Blair would say that it was not until she went into gaol in Australia that she actually understood the consequences of her offending.

11I want to mention one matter simply for the purposes of ensuring that people understand that I have not taken it into account. Ms Blair was a woman who travelled a lot. Her trips were often paid for by her partner, the man who got her involved in this offending. I have grave suspicions about the real purpose of Ms Blair's earlier travels, but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has done this sort of thing before. I mention this circumstance only to ensure there is no suggestion that I have taken earlier offending by Ms Blair into account. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has offended in any way before and so will treat her as having committed this offence for the first time.

12I note that Ms Blair pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. That is consistent with her decision to come clean with the Customs authorities as soon as she was told that they were going to conduct an internal examination. Her willingness to facilitate the course of justice displayed both then and by pleading guilty entitles her to a reduction in the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent.

13The Crown helpfully provided me with a schedule of cases concerning internal concealment of drugs. The range of sentences imposed in other courts is quite a narrow one. Mr Peluso did not question the accuracy of the range or suggest that his client was outside that range. Accordingly the sentence that I impose is as follows.

14Ms Blair is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 29 February 2012. The non-parole period will expire thus on 27 February 2015. I set a head sentence of five years.

		11 October 2012",2012-09-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760009,Director of Public Prosecutions v Paluzzano [2012] NSWLC 13,"Judgment

REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1The offender, Karyn Paluzzano, committed crimes of dishonesty whilst she was the New South Wales Member of Parliament for Penrith, Parliamentary Secretary and Assistant Minister for Education and Training. She is to be sentenced for those crimes.

THE OFFENCES
2The offences are as follows.

Sequence 2: Obtaining Money by False or Misleading Statements between 29 August 2006 and 24 November 2006 contrary to section 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

Sequence 3: Obtaining Money by False or Misleading Statements between 7 May 2007 and 1 June 2007 contrary to section 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

Sequence 6: Obtaining Money by False or Misleading Statement between 4 June 2007 and 29 June 2007 contrary to section 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

Sequence 4: Knowingly Give False and Misleading Evidence in proceedings before the Independent Commission Against Corruption ('ICAC') on 16 April 2010 contrary to section 87(1) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW).

Form 1 offence: sequence 5- to be taken into account in sentencing for sequence 4: Knowingly Give False and Misleading Evidence in proceedings before the ICAC on 16 April 2010 contrary to section 87(1) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW).

THE FACTS
3The Agreed Facts are outlined in Exhibit 1. 

4In 2003, the offender was elected as the New South Wales Member of Parliament (MP) for Penrith. Upon her election, the offender was entitled to the services of two permanent electoral staff in order to assist her in fulfilling her parliamentary duties.

5In August 2006, the New South Wales Parliamentary Remuneration Tribunal introduced a new entitlement which became known as Sitting Day Relief ('SDR') payment. The SDR payment was introduced for the purposes of financing the employment of a temporary relief worker for electorate offices on parliamentary sitting days when a permanent electoral staff member was absent from the office and attending Parliament House with their MP.

6Payment under the SDR scheme required that the relief staff member worked at the electoral office, namely Penrith in the case of the offender, whilst one of her permanent staff members worked at Parliament House.

7At the time of the introduction of the SDR payment in August 2006, the offender had two electoral staff member positions filled by Timothy Horan for one position and Kerrie Donlan (on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays) and Rhonda Medlen (on Wednesdays and Thursdays), who jointly shared the second position.

Sequence 2:
8During 2006, seven SDR claim forms were submitted to the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly for payment covering 17 separate sitting days at Parliament. The details of the seven SDR claim forms can be summarised as follows:

9On each of the 7 SDR claim forms, the offender certified via her signature that the terms of SDR payment had been satisfied via the following declaration:
The electorate officer nominated above worked at Parliament House and temporary staff worked at my electorate office on the sitting days the relief entitlement has been claimed.

10Within the seven SDR forms, temporary staff member Jennifer Launt was identified as having worked within the Penrith electorate office on 17 different days. However, rather than working at the Penrith electorate office on the identified days, Ms Launt performed work on 17 other days assisting the offender (in and around Penrith) whilst being paid by Parliament under the terms of the SDR scheme. These SDR forms also falsely stated that electoral staff members, Tim Horan and Rhonda Medlen, had attended Parliament House on these same days when they had in fact worked within the Penrith electorate office.

Sequence 3:
11During May 2007 a further five SDR claims were signed by the offender covering seven separate sitting days at Parliament. The details of the five SDR claim forms from 2007 can be summarised as follows:

13Each form stated that either temporary staff member Melanie Palmer, Grace Gumkowski or Keely Horan had performed work within the Penrith electoral office on each of the identified days. However, these temporary relief officers performed their work at Parliament House (and not the Penrith electoral office as stated). The same forms also stated that on each of the identified days, either Kerrie Donlan, Jennifer Launt (a permanent staff member as of 2007) or Tim Horan had accompanied the offender to Parliament House. However, these electoral staff members had in fact worked within the Penrith electoral office and not Parliament House as stated.

14The offender, by signing the abovementioned false declarations, obtained an additional staff member who benefited through paid employment under the SDR scheme despite non-compliance with its stated requirements.

Sequence 4:
15On 16 April 2010, the offender gave false evidence before the ICAC at a Compulsory Examination in relation to false claims for SDR payments. She denied being knowingly party to any improper conduct in relation to falsely claiming monies for her office or for any of her employees through the SDR scheme. The questions and her answers were:

Q: Were you party to the, were you knowingly party to any falsification of (SDR) records?
A: No.

Q: Were you knowingly (a) party to any improper conduct in relation to claiming monies for your office (or) for any employee?
A: No. 

16On 5 and 6 May 2010, the offender gave a contrary version of events before an ICAC Public Inquiry when she acknowledged having given false evidence on 16 April 2010 in relation to the SDR scheme. The questions and her answers were:

Q: And do you accept that following the introduction of that facility (SDR) by the New South Wales Parliament you signed a number of sitting day relief forms in the years 2006 and 2007 which did not reflect the true position regarding the employment of people on sitting, or sitting day relief?
A: I did.

Q: You accepted in your evidence yesterday that you'd signed declarations for sitting day relief knowing them to be false?
A: That's correct.

Q: And making false declarations to Parliament?
A: That's correct.

Q: It would be quite false to say that you were not a knowing party to any improper conduct in relation to claiming moneys either for your office or for any employee?
A: That's correct.

The Form 1 - sequence 5:
17The Form 1 is Exhibit 2.

18On 16 April 2010, the offender gave evidence before the ICAC at a Compulsory Examination in relation to the practice of having somebody from her staff accompany her to Parliament. The question and her answer were:

Q: I understand that, but my question was a simple one, as a matter of course it was the practice of your office to your knowledge to have someone accompany you each day you went to Parliament as from 30 August 2006?
A: That's, that's correct.

19On 6 May 2010, the offender acknowledged her statement on 16 April 2010 that it was her practice to have a member of staff accompany her to Parliament on sitting days in late 2006 was also false. The questions and her answers were:

Q: So how could you truthfully say three weeks ago that it was the practice of your office to have someone accompanying you each day you went to Parliament as from 30 August 2006? How can you truthfully say it? Can you explain how you can truthfully say that?
A: No, no.

Q: So we can accept you?
A: Yes.

Q: That it was false?
A: Yep.

Q: And it was false to your Knowledge at the time, namely 16 April 2010. It was, wasn't it?
A: Yeah. Yes.

THE MAXIMUM PENALTIES
20For sequences 2, 3 and 6, obtaining money by false or misleading statements, the maximum penalty for each offence is imprisonment of 5 years. As there was no election to have these matters dealt with on indictment, the jurisdictional limit of 12 months imprisonment applies to each offence. This is because the value of the money obtained in each offence was less than $5,000.

21For sequence 4, knowingly giving false and misleading evidence to the ICAC, the maximum penalty is a fine of $22,000 or imprisonment of 5 years or both. As there was no election to have this matter dealt with on indictment, the jurisdictional limit is 2 years imprisonment.

THE OFFENDER'S EVIDENCE OF THE OFFENCES
22The offender gave evidence of running a very busy electorate office in Penrith at the times of the offences. For example, from 2003 to 2010, she conducted mail-outs (as exhibited under tab 13 of Exhibit 5) and 'Pollie in the Park' sessions every fortnight. She was a member of many committees and undertook many community responsibilities.

23Of the office staff, Mr Horan had a full-time position, whilst the remaining position was shared between two people. The offender's approach to staffing the shared position was to select people from the TAFE system and particularly provide opportunities to women keen to return to work after having children.

24In 2006, the offender began to have concerns about the performance of Mr Horan. Furthermore, there was a lot of absenteeism in 2006 and 2007, as evidenced in Exhibit 6.

25The offender stated that she did not prepare the SDR claim forms. She said that she signed them without verifying their accuracy. In her evidence-in-chief, the offender stated that all MPs have to trust their staff and she trusted Mr Horan as her office manager. She said she should have been more diligent.

26Following cross-examination of the offender, the Court sought clarification of the basis of the pleas of guilty to the SDR offences. It was pointed out by the Court that the offender had accepted in her later evidence in the ICAC proceedings that she had signed the SDR forms at a time when she knew them to be false. The offender's counsel sought clarification from her client. The offender then gave evidence that, at the time she signed some of the SDR claim forms, she knew they were incorrect. She said that she also signed some blank forms. The offender could not remember which forms that are the subject of the offences were blank or incorrect when she signed them.

27The offender states that she did not receive any financial benefit from the offences. She claimed that the SDR funds paid as a result of the fraudulent claims went directly to the staff members. The money was paid for work actually performed, albeit not under the qualification requirements for SDRs validly to be paid.

28In respect of giving false and misleading evidence at the ICAC, the offender stated that she was traumatised at that time. She said that in 2009, it was brought to her attention that Mr Horan was not performing his duties and that others had to absorb his work. The offender sought advice from the human resources section of Parliament and she then met with Mr Horan and gave him a letter of warning about his performance at work. It was reported to the offender that Mr Horan had threatened a staff member and was causing stress and fear to the other staff members. The offender sought advice about security issues.

29When the offender indicated she would report these matters, she said that Mr Horan threatened to accuse her of misappropriation of funds if she went ahead with the report. Nonetheless, the offender did report Mr Horan's conduct to the Parliamentary Speaker and the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly undertook an investigation into Mr Horan's activities. Mr Horan was then suspended from duty on full pay. Mr Horan then went to the ICAC and accused the offender of inappropriate dealings with claims.

30By the time of the ICAC proceedings on 16 April 2010, the offender stated she was fearful for her life. She and one of her children had received anonymous threatening letters. Decapitated rabbits had been placed at the entries to her home. She said she was concentrating on forged forms from her office. She cannot remember if she was caught by surprise by the questions concerning the SDR claims.

THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS OF THE CRIMINALITY
31Whilst section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) 1999 ('the Act') provides a list of aggravating factors to be taken into account in assessing the appropriate sentence for an offence, this is not an exhaustive list. That section does not absolve the Court from the task of also analysing the criminality involved in the elements of the offences and so determining the degree of criminality involved in the commission of the offences. Factors of aggravation might be referred to within section 21A of the Act or arise in an analysis of the elements themselves.

Breach of Trust
32The offences before the Court are all serious offences of dishonesty. They are underpinned by moral turpitude in relation to the repeated breaches of the trust placed in the offender by the public and in relation to the lack of respect she accorded the justice system. As a Member of Parliament, the offender enjoyed a high position of trust to act in the public interest. Whilst the offender did not personally receive the funds involved in the false claims, her repeated breaches of public trust must be characterised as gross breaches. She obtained public money for others who performed work on behalf of the offender in circumstances where the offender was not entitled to pay public money to those people for their work.

33The offender's counsel submits on her behalf that, ""[i]t is arguable that she was at all times acting in the public interest as she was providing a service to the public by obtaining payment for the staff"". This submission is rejected. It misses the obvious point that the staff and the offender on their behalf were not entitled to the public funds; if the offender needed the work done other than under the valid SDR entitlement, then it was for the offender and her staff to come to some arrangement or for the offender to fund the work herself.

34The 18 false SDR claims also required a number of the offender's staff to participate in the fraudulent course of conduct. As the Crown rightly submits, the offender therefore has misused her authority in engaging in that fraudulent course of conduct involving her own staff.

The degree of recklessness in the SDR offences
35The offender committed the SDR offences with ""reckless disregard"" as to whether the statements were false. The offender's evidence was that she signed some blank forms and she also signed some completed forms which she knew to be false. It is clear that her recklessness in committing the offences of Obtain Money by False or Misleading Statement was of a high degree. She was not merely acting out of a failure to verify the information, but instead, she knew the details were false on some forms and for others, she knew that she was signing a document that had no details, therefore again knowingly executing a false document. Under section 4A of the Crimes Act 1900, 'recklessness' includes 'intention or knowledge'. Whilst that provision was enacted after the commission of the SDR offences, the legislation reflected the common law understanding of that term which existed at the time of the offences.

The aspect of knowledge in the giving of false evidence 
36The Crown submits that the false evidence of the offender was about a matter absolutely central to the purpose of the ICAC proceedings. Although the offender could not in the sentencing proceedings remember whether she was surprised by questions in the ICAC proceedings about the false claims, the Crown points out that the offender must have known that she was summoned on 30 March 2010 to give evidence of such matters. The offender herself stated that Mr Doran had threatened to reveal such matters to the ICAC and he did indeed report the allegations as threatened. It is inconceivable that the offender was caught by surprise by the questions in circumstances where she acknowledged that she knowingly had signed numerous false claims and had been threatened by Mr Doran with their disclosure to the ICAC. The false evidence furthermore did not involve an exaggeration or a misleading statement, but instead, deliberately false evidence whilst she was still a Member of Parliament with a duty to uphold the administration of justice.

The course of conduct
37The breaches of trust involved in the offences of Obtaining Money by False and Misleading Statements extended over the submission by the offender of 18 false forms between 29 August 2006 and 29 June 2007. The offender not only committed the crimes concerning the SDRs, she then compounded her criminality years later by lying about those crimes in the ICAC proceedings. She was given a chance then to admit her crimes, but her guilty conscience was not so great as to cause her to admit her wrongdoing until further proceedings in May 2010.

THE MITIGATING FACTORS OF CRIMINALITY AND SUBJECTIVE FEATURES
Small total amount of money and the fact the offender did not receive the money herself
38The amount of money involved in the SDR offences was relatively small, totalling approximately $4,200. Whilst the offender herself did not receive these monies, these features of mitigation are largely eclipsed by the breach of trust, the number of claims signed by the offender with knowledge of their falsity and the fact she compounded the criminality by giving false evidence in the ICAC proceedings about those false claims.

39As stated by his Honour, Judge Henson, Chief Magistrate, in Independent Commission Against Corruption v Karkowski [2012] NSWLC 6 at [31]:

The fact that the monetary value put on the acts of corruption by the prosecution is relatively small does not trivialise or mitigate the fundamental nature of corruption. ...[T]he quantum of the benefit goes to the question of the maximum jurisdictional legislative penalty. It does not mitigate the essential nature of corruption as a blight on the community.

Pleas of guilty
40The offender pleaded guilty to the offences on the ninth mention of the matter. The proceedings commenced in the Court on 21 November 2011 and the matter was eventually listed for a hearing to determine if the Court would allow witnesses to be called at committal proceedings. The offender then entered pleas of guilty on 7 June 2012 when another charge was withdrawn by the prosecution.

41There was some discussion in the sentencing proceedings as to the discount to be allowed for the plea. It was submitted by counsel for the offender that the plea attracts the maximum discount of 25 percent. It was conceded that the now repealed criminal case conferencing legislation did not apply to these proceedings in providing a greater discount as the court attendance notices were filed after 8 October 2011.

42Counsel for the defence submits that this chronology warrants the application of the maximum discount for the plea of guilty due to the utilitarian value in avoiding the need for a hearing. This does not accord with legal precedent or logic. Clearly, if a plea of guilty had been entered at the first mention of the matter, the utilitarian value would be greater than the utilitarian value afforded in this matter. It would be against public policy to apply the same discount in this matter without any distinction. That would not serve to encourage pleas of guilty at an early opportunity. It would not facilitate the efficient administration of the criminal justice system. It is not appropriate to suggest that the pleas should be characterised as early pleas of guilty due to the fact that the pleas were entered immediately upon the withdrawal of one of the charges. As summarised by his Honour, Justice Howie, in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32]:

The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount.... Generally, the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced.... The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain... or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown....

43Accordingly, the discount appropriate given the timing of the plea in these proceedings is 20 percent and not the maximum of 25 percent.

Assistance
44The offender is entitled under section 23 of the Act to a further discount in her sentence for the assistance provided to authorities as revealed in Exhibit 4. The value attributed to the assistance is reasonably high and, together with the discount for pleading guilty, the combined discount is assessed at 40 percent.

Prior good character
45The offender has produced many good character references in Exhibit 5. She has no prior criminal history. Her counsel's submissions state that all of the character references provided by the offender ""speak highly of her honesty, integrity and community service"". The weight to be given to good character must be tempered by the offender's breach of the trust placed in her as a Member of Parliament. It was only because of her prior good character that the offender was placed in the position of trust where she had an opportunity to commit the SDR offences repeatedly between 2006 and 2007 without detection. Accordingly, less weight may be attributed to the prior good character: R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527. The overriding need for general deterrence can result, as it does in this case, in a reduced weight that might otherwise be attributed to prior good character.

Remorse and prospects of rehabilitation
46The offender gave genuine evidence of her remorse for her offences. That remorse is demonstrated in her further evidence to the ICAC on 5 and 6 May 2010 when the offender confessed her offences.

47It is of some concern that the offender has not consistently demonstrated an acceptance of her full criminality. For example, it has been noted that the offender gave evidence-in-chief in the sentencing proceedings which suggested that the SDR offences were committed through her lack of diligence in verifying the accuracy of the claims she signed and that the lack of diligence came about because she was so busy with her public duties and that she needed to trust her office manager, Mr Horan. This was despite her evidence that she began to have concerns about Mr Horan's work in 2006, when the offences began. Then, in later evidence, after the Court pointed to the admission in the later ICAC proceedings of signing the forms whilst knowing them to be false, the offender gave evidence that she had, at least in respect of some of the claims, signed them in direct knowledge of their falsity. She then clarified that some forms were blank when she signed them and the others were known by her to be false.

48The offender furthermore had been asked about her attitude to the offences by the author of the Pre-Sentence Report dated 9 August 2012 that is Exhibit 3. The offender denied her direct knowledge of the falsity of the claims when she signed them. The report states the following:

In relation to the ""Make False Statement"" offences, Mrs Paluzzano accepted responsibility for signing the documents which were false and admitted that she should not have signed the documents without ensuring the veracity of the information contained therein. However, she denied being aware at the time of signing, that the documents contained information later proved to be false. She claimed to have been under constant stress due to both the nature and volume of work which she was required to process as an MP, a situation exacerbated by difficulties she was experiencing in managing the difficult behaviour of a particular staff member. She also claimed to have been experiencing other pressing family responsibilities and personal ill-health during this period. Mrs Paluzzano claimed that because of these demands, she placed her trust in her electoral office staff members to ensure the accuracy and veracity of all documents submitted for her signature. She now accepts that she should have checked the veracity of the documents herself, before signing them.

49Equally, when the offender was interviewed by Dr Nielsen, there was no indication of the offender's direct knowledge of the falsity of the claims when she signed them. Dr Nielsen stated the following at page 2 of his report dated 7 August 2012 in Exhibit 5:

Ms Paluzzano said that she was too busy with parliamentary and electoral duties to keep abreast of the day to day running of her office.... She said that [Mr Horan] was responsible for managing the office and the decisions regarding the deployment of staff that were later the subject of the adverse finding by ICAC were actually made by him, although she agreed she was ultimately responsible and consented to the arrangement.

50The offender's earlier accounts of the offences, all made following her pleas of guilty, have the appearance of attempting to minimise the criminality without disclosing her more direct knowledge of the falsity with which she signed the SDR claims. The weight to be given to her remorse must be tempered by this apparent, repeated attempt to minimise or even deny her criminality. This in turn detracts from what might be otherwise seen as good prospects of rehabilitation.

Extra-curial punishment - family and staff suffered, media attention, loss of job
51The offender gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings that her family have suffered as a result of her offences and their public exposure. She spoke about the impact of these events on her children's education and emotional wellbeing. The offender has three children, aged 18, 17 and 13 respectively. She also has a husband. The evidence of the offender detailed the negative impact of the proceedings and what she described as ""ferocious"" media scrutiny upon herself and her family.

52Furthermore, the staff of the offender's electoral office no longer have employment in that capacity.

53The offender herself resigned from public office following her admissions made to the ICAC on 5 and 6 May 2010. She has retrained in education and has more recently been employed as a teacher. The offender fears that a full-time sentence of imprisonment will prevent her working as a teacher. In fact, the offender's pleas of guilty already have resulted in a review as to the eligibility of the offender to work as a teacher.

The offender's mental state at the time of giving false and misleading evidence to the ICAC
54The offender gave evidence that at the time she gave false evidence to the ICAC on 16 April 2010, she was under extreme stress and was fearful. She said that as a result of Mr Horan's difficult behaviour, the anonymous, threatening letters she and her daughter had received, the intense media scrutiny and the decapitated rabbits left at her home, she was in fear of her life.

55The offender furthermore said that her focus in preparing for the ICAC proceedings was on unrelated forgeries, not on the SDR claims. She gave evidence that the period of the ICAC proceedings was extremely traumatic and that she was ""in a terrible state"" and had to receive medical assistance.

56The report of Dr Steven Wong dated 7 August 2012 in Exhibit 5 states that the offender was treated in April and May 2010 for extreme stress and anxiety attacks requiring counselling and benzodiazepam medication.

57Ms Julie-Ann Geddes, clinical psychologist, gave evidence that she was asked by Parliament to give trauma support to the offender in March 2010. She confirmed that at that time, the offender was traumatised. Following the further ICAC proceedings, the offender had a ""breakdown"" and was not sleeping or coping. The offender was prescribed Valium by a doctor.

Mental health
58The offender has been diagnosed as suffering from adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression. Dr Olav Nielsen, in his report dated 7 August 2012 contained within Exhibit 5, stated:

My impression from the one interview is that she was still significantly depressed and would probably benefit from further treatment and would not rule out the possible benefit of treatment with antidepressant medication.

59An offender's mental condition in sentencing proceedings is relevant in a number of ways. It can have the effect of reducing the assessment of the moral culpability so that matters such as general deterrence, retribution and denunciation have less weight: Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 354. However, if an offender acts with knowledge of what he or she is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of the actions, the moderation need not be great: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51 to 52; Benitez v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 166 at [41] to [42]; Taylor v R [2006] NSWCCA 7 at [30]. In this case, the offender was not suffering from any particular mental health issues at the time of the SDR offences. At the time of giving false evidence in the ICAC proceedings, the offender was suffering stress and anxiety, but it is not suggested that those conditions detracted from her knowledge of what she was doing and of the gravity of the actions, even if it is a ""blur"" to her now as she stated in her evidence. In these circumstances, the strong needs for general deterrence and denunciation are not greatly reduced by evidence of the offender's mental health.

60The offender's mental health is relevant to rehabilitation: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71. As stated by Dr Nielsen, the offender would benefit from further treatment.

Delay
61Counsel for the offender submits that there was considerable delay in prosecuting this matter. The SDR offences were committed from August 2006 until June 2007. The date of giving false evidence in the ICAC proceedings was 16 April 2010. On 5 and 6 May 2010, the offender then admitted the falsity of her earlier evidence. The Court Attendance Notices were served on 1 November 2011.

62Since the offences, the offender has taken steps towards her rehabilitation. She left Parliament on 5 May 2010 and has requalified as a teacher. The offender has more recently been employed in that capacity. She has sought medical diagnosis, counselling and treatment. 

63In R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519, the impact of delay on sentence was explained as follows.

Moreover where there has been a lengthy postponement, fairness... requires weight to be given to the progress on his rehabilitation.... (and) to the circumstance he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense... to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence.... at times this can require what might be otherwise a quite undue degree of leniency being extended....

COMPARABLE CASES
64The counsel for the defence has provided the decisions in comparable cases by which the appropriate sentence in this case can be determined. It is, of course, difficult to find any case which involves a similar factual matrix.

65In DPP v Kostakidis [2010] NSWLC 20, the offender was a police officer who pleaded guilty to three counts of giving false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission and was sentenced to good behaviour bonds of two years under s 9 of the Act. That case did not involve the type of criminality involved in the SDR offences which are also involved in this case. There had been a delay of over three years between the offences and the commencement of prosecution. The combination of this delay and the assistance to authorities caused the Court to exercise leniency rather than to impose the sentence of full-time imprisonment which otherwise would have been imposed.

66In DPP v Harb [2007] NSWLC 26, the offender was sentenced to 104 hours of community service to be served concurrently for each charge. The offences were committed when the offender held himself out to be a lawyer whilst he was employed as a clerk in the Local Court Registry at Penrith. Whilst there was abuse of the offender's position as a public official in that case, the criminality did not involve such a gross breach of trust as occurred in this case.

67In R v Purcell [2010] NSWDC 98, the offender was a Superintendent of Police. He pleaded guilty to a common law offence of misconducting himself as the holder of public office and giving misleading evidence to the Police Integrity Commission. In essence, the offender had disobeyed a direction from a senior officer concerning what the offender could say to members of the media. His misleading evidence was concerned with whether he had contacted anyone in respect of the matter under investigation. The circumstances of the offender losing his career, of the suffering of the offender's family as a result of the matters and the delay of eighteen months between offence and prosecution all caused the Court to decide that a sentence of imprisonment was not required. The offender was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 for the common law offence and 200 hours community service for the misleading evidence charge. Whilst there is evidence of loss of career, suffering by the offender's family and delay in prosecution for a similar period here, the breach of trust and deception was far greater and occurred over a more prolonged period. This in turn increases the need for deterrence to be reflected in the sentence.

68In R v Phillip William Smith [2011] NSWDC 38, a Police officer was sentenced to a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 15 months for the offence of perverting the course of justice. That offence attracted a longer maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The delay of about two years between offence and charge was significant in the Court's decision to impose a sentence other than full-time imprisonment.

69In DPP v Mourched [2010] NSWLC 2, the offender was sentenced for one offence of publishing a false statement for a financial advantage under section 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty was five years imprisonment with a jurisdictional limit of two years as the value involved was $955,620. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment of a minimum period of 12 months and 23 days with an additional term of 4 months and 8 days to be served by way of home detention. In that case, there was the one offence and no position of trust held by the offender.

70In Retsos v R [2006] NSWCCA 85, the offender pleaded guilty to three counts of knowingly giving false evidence to the ICAC and to one count of aiding and abetting the corrupt solicitation of a pecuniary benefit which carried a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The offender was sentenced to a total of three years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. In that case, unlike the present case, the offender was not himself in a position of trust.

SECTION 3A OF THE ACT
71Section 3A of the Act provides an exhaustive list of purposes of sentence. The weight to be accorded to each matter necessarily depends on the circumstances of the particular case.

72In this case, the offences involve repeated breaches of trust, abuse of public position and a disregard for the administration of justice. These matters require that the sentence strongly reflect general deterrence. As the Crown submits, the community would be justified in having an expectation that when the integrity of the administration of justice is attacked, condign punishment ought be imposed to deter further crimes. The subjective features, whilst relevant in the sentencing exercise, cannot overshadow the requirement to reflect the seriousness of the criminality in determining the appropriate sentence: R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398; Carruthers v R [2007] NSWCCA 276.

73In R v Myers (NSWCCA, 13 February 1990, unrep), his Honour, Justice Hunt, with whom their Honours Justices Finlay and Allen agreed, stated:

But all subjective considerations such as these are, as this Court has often said, necessarily subsidiary to the powerful obligation of the courts to prevent the commission of these crimes in the future: R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597-8. Personal rehabilitation is important, but more important is public deterrence.

74The need for condign punishment is also required to achieve general deterrence because of the difficulties in detecting and prosecuting such offences. In R v Aristodemou (NSWCCA, 30 June 1994, unrep), his Honour Justice Badgery-Parker was considering an appeal against a sentence imposed for an offence against section 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW), the same offence as sequence 4 here. His Honour stated:

Any person who commits an offence of perjury or false swearing in the course of judicial proceedings or in proceedings such as a Royal Commission or an [Independent Commission Against Corruption] Inquiry should do so in the clear understanding that if his offence is detected he will go to gaol except in very particular circumstances.

THE SENTENCES
75Considering all of the aggravating, mitigating and subjective factors, if the sentences are to appropriately reflect the seriousness of the criminality, as they must, then only custodial sentences are appropriate for each of these offences. This also takes into account the admonition provided in section 5 of the Act.

76The next consideration is the appropriate length of each sentence and the accumulation of the sentences to reflect the totality of criminality. This determination is to be made without regard to the manner in which the sentence is to be served: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26]. The discount of 40 percent will be applied in reaching the term of the sentences. The Form 1 matter is taken into account in aggravating the sentence for sequence 4. Whilst the maximum jurisdiction of the Local Court is constrained to a legislated jurisdictional limit, the seriousness of the criminality is determined by reference to the maximum penalty and not the jurisdictional limit: R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115.

77The sentences imposed are as follows:
Sequence 2: Imprisonment of 7 months as a fixed term.

Sequence 3: Imprisonment of 7 months as a fixed term to be partly consecutive upon the sentence for sequence 2 by one month.

Sequence 6: Imprisonment of 7 months as a fixed term to be partly consecutive upon the sentence for sequence 3 by one month.

Sequence 4: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 months and a total term of 14 months. Special circumstances are found in altering the statutory ratio between the non-parole and parole periods in light of the offender's on-going need for mental health treatment. This sentence is to be partly consecutive upon the sentence for sequence 6 by two months.

78The total sentence therefore is one of a non-parole period of 12 months with a total term of 18 months imprisonment.

79It now must be determined how the sentence is to be served. Whilst the Crown in this case submits that only a custodial sentence is appropriate, it does not submit that the sentence can only be one of full-time custody. The Crown suggests that the Court might find particular circumstances which derogate from the usual need to impose a full-time sentence of imprisonment.

80Suspending the sentences of imprisonment under section 12 of the Act would be counterproductive to the need for general deterrence in this case. A sentence served by way of an intensive correction order equally would not be sufficiently reflective of that need for general deterrence. The next most serious custodial option is home detention. This option is the last alternative before a full-time sentence is applied. Home detention involves a severe restriction of liberty where an offender is not entitled to leave the home other than as approved by the Department of Corrective Services for such matters as medical appointments. Prisoners on home detention undergo constant monitoring and, where appropriate, mandatory counselling and treatment.

81Whilst the need for specific deterrence is of fundamental significance in this case, it must be balanced against some subjective features. This would be the offender's first time in custody. The offender has experienced considerable delay in the prosecution of these matters in which time she has embarked on a course of rehabilitation and retrained and been employed as a teacher. The offender has been seeking treatment for her depression and anxiety. Her family, including three children, two of whom are at school, have suffered. Whilst it was conceded by counsel for the offender that this did not amount to exceptional hardship to third parties, it is relevant in determining the manner in which a custodial sentence is to be served: ICAC v Karkowski.

82It is therefore appropriate, subject to a suitability assessment by Probation and Parole, that the sentences of imprisonment be served by way of home detention. The proceedings will be adjourned until 18 October 2012 to enable the assessment to be completed. The offender must report to Probation and Parole forthwith.

2760014,Gurung v R [2012] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant, Renuka Gurung was charged with two offences in the District Court. In relation to one of the offences she entered a plea of guilty. The second matter proceeded to trial before a judge of the District Court and a jury.

2On the second day of the trial she offered, and the Crown accepted, a plea to that count. She pleaded guilty in the presence of the jury and the jury was discharged. 

3On 8 June 2012 the applicant came before the court for sentence; submissions were heard and bail was revoked. The matter was fixed for sentence on 27 July 2012. However, in the meantime the applicant filed a notice of motion in which she sought to withdraw her plea to the second count. That motion was made returnable on 27 July 2012.

4When the matter came before the Judge on 27 July, there was a discussion with counsel about its future progress. By this time, because the applicant was in custody, her advocate raised the possibility that, pending the disposition of her application to withdraw her plea, she may be granted bail.

5However, it was apparent that there was not the necessary material in the hands of the advocate, or before the Court, to enable that application to have any prospects of success if it was pursued on that day.

6At an early stage of the proceedings, the Judge indicated that he was prepared to hear the bail application on that day, but for the reason that it would obviously fail, the applicant's advocate requested that a different course be taken and that the matter be stood over. 

7As it happens the matter was stood over to 17 August, but did not proceed on that day and, instead, 31 August was provided as the adjourned date. However, as I understand the position, the matter did not proceed on that day and was further stood over for hearing to 14 September.

8During the course of the discussion about the possibility of an adjournment, the question of what would occur on the adjourned date was raised. The Judge indicated that, on that day, provided counsel had adequate time to respond, he proposed that the application to withdraw the plea would be heard.

9During the course of the discussion with the applicant's advocate, the basis for the application to withdraw the plea was briefly referred to. In the course of that discussion, Mr Killalea, who appeared for the applicant, said that the applicant complains: 

""At the very least, there is a perception that she was browbeaten by her legal team into pleading guilty, that's the substance of her complaint"".

10His Honour later remarked that he had understood from that statement by Mr Killalea that ""there appears to be some attack on Mr Overall's, [the barrister who previously appeared for the applicant], integrity in relation to the manner in which he conducted the pleas"".

11After the matter had been adjourned, it transpired that there was some difficulty with the dates. Accordingly, the matter was mentioned in the Court later that day. 

12At this later occasion Mr Killalea raised with his Honour the fact that the trial had been part-heard before his Honour, but now the plea had changed. There was an exchange between Mr Killalea and his Honour when, ultimately, what came forward from Mr Killalea was that he was instructed to ask his Honour to refer the application for leave to withdraw the plea to a different court. His Honour responded by saying, ""Certainly not"". (The Crown indicated they did not oppose that course). His Honour then said: 

""So you mean in relation to any application to withdraw the plea that that should be heard by another judge?""

13Mr Killalea responded, ""Yes"". 

14His Honour said, ""That would be entirely inappropriate"". 

15Mr Killalea then said, ""I make this formal application, your Honour"". His Honour said, ""Yes, it's refused"". 

16Mr Killalea then responded by saying, ""I haven't made it yet"". His Honour says, ""You have indicated what it is and it's the question of withdrawal of the plea of guilty, be heard by another judge. Isn't that your application?"" Mr Killalea does not directly respond to that statement, but said to his Honour, ""I'm going to give reasons"". His Honour says, ""Yes, well, I don't need to hear them"".

17That observation was clearly made in response to the application which had then been made by Mr Killalea that his Honour should refer the hearing of the application to withdraw the plea to another judge. His Honour, understanding that application to be founded upon the proposition that the trial Judge who had heard part of a trial should not thereafter adjudicate in relation to the withdrawal of the plea, his Honour said he did not need to hear reasons. 

18I understand his Honour to have anticipated that Mr Killalea would spell out the foundation for his application which, in any event, to my mind, was plain in what had already transpired between them.

19Mr Killalea was not deterred by what his Honour had said. Although Mr Killalea indicated that he was going to provide reasons for his application that there be a different judge to hear the application to withdraw the plea, he turned to an entirely different subject. He ultimately advanced an application that his Honour should recuse himself because of an apprehension that his Honour may be biased. That apprehension was not founded upon the fact that he had been the previous trial judge but, rather, on what had transpired in the Court on that day.

20I note that, by this time, the applicant had left the Court to return to custody and the application which was made by Mr Killalea was consequently made without her being present.

21Mr Killalea said this to his Honour: 

""We're instructed in these terms before she left. We ask your Honour to recuse yourself for these reasons. That in relation to the bail application your Honour said words to this effect, 'I can tell you what the result will be now'. That's before I gave any reasons"". 

22His Honour then said ""I don't intend to recuse myself.""

23Mr Killalea then said:

""And for the second reason we ask this. Your Honour referred to an attack or apprehended attack on the integrity of the barrister. That was, with respect, not a necessary consequence. It is often enough the case in matters like this that when the relevant evidence comes forward, that a barrister with the integrity that a barrister has and if it be the case the barrister might well say what Ms Gurung has described as pretty close to what actually happened"". 

24His Honour said: 

""Yes, well, that's why I'm entertaining your application when it comes to withdraw the plea Mr Killalea or at least your client's application"". 

25His Honour then said: 

""Nothing before me yet which would cause me to grant your client bail pending your application"".

26Pausing there, it is plain that, by this stage of the proceedings, some confusion has entered into the process. Although initially advancing a reason why a different judge should hear the application based upon the fact that his Honour was the trial Judge, it is now suggested that his Honour should recuse himself. It is not suggested to this point that his Honour should do so for other than the fact that he had said in response to the question of a bail application on that day being pursued by the applicant that the result would be plain. So much was obvious and, indeed, is conceded by Mr Killalea in this Court and it was for that reason that he did not pursue the bail application in the Court below. There was simply not the material upon which the application could have any prospects of success. The second reason advanced for recusal was his Honour's reference to the possibility of an attack upon the barrister, which I have previously referred to. 

27What Mr Killalea put to his Honour, to my mind, clearly raised the possibility that a significant part of the application to withdraw the plea would be founded upon the fact that the applicant was not appropriately advised by her legal team, including her barrister. Whether or not that should be properly described as an attack upon the integrity of the barrister, to my mind, it was an indication that there would be a criticism, of the conduct of the legal team, sufficient to justify withdrawal of the plea including criticism of the applicant's barrister during the course of giving the applicant advice in relation to the course she should take in the matter.

28It is however curious that immediately after these matters were advanced, his Honour returns to the issue of bail and as I have already recorded said: 

""Nothing before me yet which would cause me to grant your client bail pending your application"". 

29The discussion continues with Mr Killalea recorded as saying: 

""With respect, that's not how it was put your Honour. How it was put was before I gave you reasons I can tell you now'"". 

30His Honour said: 

""Yes, well I don't intend to debate it, if you want to put matters on the record you can do so Mr Killalea"". 

31As I understand the situation, his Honour is still thinking that he is engaged in a discussion in relation to the bail application. Mr Killalea continued:

""If I can encapsulate. I request your Honour to recuse yourself for reasons of the two grounds I've put to your Honour and I submit to your Honour that a reasonable person in the well of this Court would reasonably apprehend that your Honour's mind was made up in relation to that matter and by no stretch of that situation for a reasonable person to anticipate that Miss Gurung would get - not beyond the stretch for a reasonable person to apprehend that Miss Gurung would not get a full and fair trial and a fair hearing on the question of - on the application for withdrawal of her plea of guilty"".

32His Honour then seeks to summarise the position as he understood it, saying: 

""Right Mr Killalea that has been noted. Might I just say that your original complaint to this Court in relation to the application to withdraw the plea was that you wished to make in the meantime a bail application. I made the comment in relation to being able to tell you the result of the application in circumstances where you had not yet put on any material before the Court in relation to the application itself but was simply indicating that you were going to seek bail before such material was in fact available or heard by the Court. In those circumstances, that was the basis for saying that I can tell you what the result would be. I would not entertain any bail application prior to there being appropriate material before the Court in relation to your client's application to withdraw the plea"". 

33His Honour then said: 

""So let's return to the purpose that we are here for now"".

34His Honour does not respond to the submission that his Honour's comment upon the integrity of the barrister would, in part, justify the application for recusal. As I have indicated, I do not believe it was necessary for his Honour to do so.

35In the event, although not in an entirely orderly manner, and not without ambiguity the transcript, to my mind, suggests that the application to recuse was advanced before his Honour. Mr Killalea was able to put his reasons before his Honour and notwithstanding his Honour's earlier comment that he did not intend to recuse himself, made, as I presently understand it, in the context of the initial indication that a different judge should be found hear the application, his Honour thereafter attended to the grounds for recusal and responded to them by the summary reasons, which I have indicated appear later in the transcript.

36Apart from my difficulty in understanding what occurred on that day, there is a significant issue as to whether or not, in the circumstances of this case, there is an interlocutory judgment, or order which could found an appeal to this Court. 

37Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act has been carefully drawn to confine an appeal by a party to proceedings to the circumstance where there is an interlocutory judgment, or order given, or made in the proceedings about which a party has concern.

38Before an appeal may be entertained by this Court, s 5F(3) provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal must be persuaded to give leave to appeal and thereafter may, if leave is granted, consider the appeal.

39The Notice of Appeal filed in these proceedings seeks to attack the order made by his Honour on 27 July to vacate the previous order and provide for the further hearing of the matter on 31 August 2012. That day has passed. 

40As we understand the position, the matter has been listed for further consideration on 14 September. The Crown accepts that the applicant would, if necessary, succeed in an application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to express it by reference to that adjourned date.

41Although there is some controversy in the authorities, it would seem that the prevailing view is that the decision of a trial judge not to recuse him or herself from a matter is not amenable to an appeal pursuant to section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

42The issue is discussed in fairly short terms in the decision of Basten J in Barakat v Goritsas, [2012] NSWCA 8 in the context of an appeal to the Court of Appeal from a trial judge in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. It is not necessary for me to develop the issues which his Honour discussed in that judgment for present purposes. 

43This issue was considered by this Court in the matter of R v Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253 where Gleeson CJ said at p 255:

""There are two aspects of the intended appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order which ought to be considered. The first concerns his Honour's refusal to accede to the application tht he should disqualify himself. It seems to me that there is no interlocutory judgment or order in that respect concerning which an appeal would lie under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. The Court of Appeal held in the case of Barton v Walker [1979] 2 NSWLR 740 that the refusal of a judge of the Supreme Court to disqualify himself after an application in that behalf had been made to him did not constitute a judgment or order against which it was possible to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Of course such a refusal might constitute a ground of appeal against the ultimate decision in the case in the course of which such an application was made, but, so it was held, a refusal by a judge to accede to a submission that he disqualify himself is not itself a judgment or an order of the court. I am respectfully of the view that the reasons that are given for that conclusion in Barton v Walker are cogent, and in my view the case should be followed in the Court of Criminal Appeal. I might add that within the last few weeks that decision has been followed in the Court of Appeal in the case of Rajski v Wood (1989) 18 NSWLR 512. Accordingly, even leaving to one side the problem about extension of time, I would have declined leave to appeal against that aspect of Judge Shillington's decision on 5 December, simply on the ground that there is no jurisdictional basis for the appeal.

His Honour's decision in relation to a refusal to vacate the hearing date stands in somewhat different position. There may well be room for considerable doubt as to whether a refusal to vacate a hearing date or grant an adjournment constitutes an interlocutory judgment or order, and this Court has been informed that in that regard the Crown would seek to reply upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213, 45 A Crim R 289. However, it seems to me that it is unnecessary to resolve that particular issue on this occasion.""

44As it happened, Gleeson CJ did not find it necessary to resolve the issue of whether or not an order in relation to the hearing date for the matter would found an appeal pursuant to s 5F to this Court. 

45The question of the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court in relation to applications for recusal have not been fully explored in the argument today. That is a consequence of the fact that this matter has been brought on for hearing urgently in order not to disrupt its orderly progress in the District Court. It must be remembered that the applicant remains in custody and any further delay in the resolution of proceedings has a capacity to impact upon her liberty. 

46I am not presently persuaded the sequence of events in the District Court would permit of a conclusion that his Honour conducted himself in a manner which would give rise in the mind of the reasonable person to an apprehension that his Honour was biased and would not fairly deal with the matter. My view of the sequence of events is there was a serious lack of understanding between Mr Killalea and his Honour as to the nature of the application that was being made and the foundation for it. No doubt this was at least partly caused by the fact that his Honour was dealing with the matter in amongst a busy list and that the application for recusal was made after the matter had been returned to the list later in the day for the purpose of changing the adjourned date.

47Although I am not persuaded that the transcript would justify a conclusion that his Honour erred in the manner in which the proceedings were conducted, it is plain that if a judge refuses to listen to argument in support of an application to recuse, or indeed in relation to any application of substance in a matter, then there is likely to be an error which may justify the intervention of this Court because of reasonable apprehension that the judge may not bring an impartial mind to the matter.

48As I have indicated, I am not persuaded having regard to the transcript that his Honour's remarks could justify a conclusion that a reasonable bystander would apprehend that his Honour was biased. Of course, that decision would not preclude the applicant from making a further application to his Honour. His Honour would have to consider that application in light of his understanding of the events which occurred on 27 July.

49Beyond that matter as I have indicated, there is a real question as to whether or not this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. This is not the appropriate case in which to resolve that issue. 

50For those reasons leave to appeal should be refused. 

51I should also indicate that the Crown conceded in the course of argument that if the applicant wished later to pursue a further application that his Honour recuse himself, the Crown would not seek to submit that the applicant was precluded from raising that issue either in the court below or in this Court. 

52McCALLUM J: With great respect to the Chief Judge at Common Law, I am unable to agree with his Honour. Before stating my reasons for reaching a different conclusion, I note a preliminary issue as to the form of the relief sought. 

53As the Chief Judge has stated, the order sought to be appealed against is an order vacating the earlier date fixed for the hearing of the application to withdraw the plea and listing the proceedings for hearing on 31 August 2012, a date which has now passed. 

54The Court was informed during argument that, on 31 August 2012, the proceedings were again stood over for hearing on 14 September 2012. It was indicated on behalf of the applicant that, if necessary, leave would be sought to amend the application accordingly. Further, the Crown very fairly indicated that such amendment would not be opposed. The remarks which follow are directed to the foreshadowed amended application. 

55I accept that this Court properly guards jealously its jurisdiction under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Nevertheless, as was acknowledged by Gleeson CJ in R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723, no single principle should circumscribe the discretion of this Court in deciding whether to grant or to withhold leave to appeal. It is necessary to consider the interests of justice in any individual case. 

56I accept also that there may be an issue as to whether the order sought to be appealed from (as identified in the proposed amendment to the application) is one in respect of which leave under s 5F(3) may be granted. In my view, however, that is not in itself a reason for refusing leave but rather an issue which could properly be fully ventilated upon the granting of leave. Whilst different views have been expressed on the issue, I take comfort from the approach that was taken by Basten JA in Barakat v Goritsas [2012] NSWCA 8. I acknowledge that was not a case directly concerned with the language of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, since it was a proceeding in the Court of Appeal. Conversely, it may be noted that the present case does not involve a judge of the Supreme Court, as Barakat did. In any event, Basten JA evidently had no difficulty accepting the proposition that, in circumstances where a refusal by a judge to recuse him or herself does not in itself form a proper basis for an appeal, it is usually not difficult to identify ""a later interlocutory order"" which might properly be the vehicle for an appeal. 

57In those circumstances Basten JA recorded the agreement of the parties in that case that the notice of appeal could properly be amended to include a challenge to the order of the primary judge (who had refused to recuse himself) fixing a date for the hearing of the contempt proceedings. Whilst, as I have already noted, that was a case in the Court of Appeal, I think it is at least arguable that such an order could properly be characterised as an ""interlocutory order"" for the purposes of s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

58Mr Killalea explained that the relief sought in the present case was framed by reference to the remarks of Basten JA in that case. The correctness of that approach is a matter which, in my respectful opinion, could properly be argued and does not of itself warrant the refusal of leave. 

59To my mind the critical consideration in the present case is the effect of the order as a matter of substance. Although the order sought to be appealed from is in effect an adjournment and the fixing of a date for hearing which was made by consent (certainly as to the date), in substance it reflected his Honour's determination to proceed to hear the application after refusing to recuse himself. 

60Although I accept that exceptional or unusual circumstances would ordinarily have to be established in order to warrant the consideration of an appeal against an order fixing a hearing date, I think such circumstances are established in the present case. 

61I would respectfully disagree with the Chief Judge's analysis of what transpired as recorded in the transcript. In particular, in my view, there was a respectable basis for the contention sought to be made by the application for leave that the judge had expressed a view, before seeing the foreshadowed further evidence, as to the likelihood of the applicant's being successful in obtaining bail. 

62Further, his Honour had made statements as to which I think there was a respectable basis for the contention now sought to be argued concerning whether the application entailed criticism of the barrister who had previously appeared for the applicant. Further, the judge had noted before the recusal application was made that the agreed facts in respect of the offences been signed by the applicant, implicitly expressing some scepticism as to the likely outcome of the application in due course.

63Against that background, with great respect to the judge below, in my view his Honour's blanket refusal to entertain or engage in any way with the reasons sought to be stated by Mr Killalea on behalf of the applicant was unfortunate. I should emphasise that the applicant does not suggest actual bias on the judge's part. In my assessment, however, the exchange recorded in the transcript provides a proper basis for the applicant's contention of apprehended bias. Further, it must be recalled that the applicant has now been in custody for 3 months since she was remanded by the judge during the sentencing proceedings.

64If it were established at the hearing of the substantive appeal that a basis did exist for a reasonable apprehension that the judge would not bring an impartial mind to the application to withdraw the plea, the result would be that his Honour should not hear that application. So much was established in the decision of the High Court in R v Watson; ex parte Armstrong (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 263.6. I do not accept that the applicant should have no remedy in that event until after the application has been heard by his Honour. An entitlement to a fair hearing by a judge as to whom there is neither actual bias nor any reasonable apprehension of bias is a fundamental incident of the administration of justice. 

65In my view, s 5F(3) affords a remedy for the protection of that entitlement that this Court should not refuse leave to pursue in the particular circumstances of the present case. It is often stated that a warrant for reluctance to grant leave under s 5F(3) is the risk that many such applications will be brought where a claim of apprehended bias is seen to be ""colourable, or merely a stalking horse to achieve the result refused by the trial judge such as delay of a scheduled trial"" (see Barakat at p 10.) 

66There can be no suggestion in the present case that what is sought is to delay the prosecution of the application to withdraw the plea. On the contrary, the applicant having been remanded in custody, it has been made clear by her legal representatives she would seek to have that application determined as quickly as possible. For those reasons, I would grant leave to amend the application and leave to appeal under s 5F(3). 

67GARLING J: Like the Chief Judge at Common Law, I express no view as it is unnecessary so to do on the question of whether there was or was not an interlocutory judgment or order in this case sufficient for the purpose of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

68The substantive matters relied upon in this Court for his Honour to recuse himself are not matters which are sufficient, in my opinion, to support a grant of leave to appeal under s 5F. No question of general principle arises. 

69However, it is open to the applicant to renew and be allowed to fully develop an application for recusal to his Honour on the basis that, not as a general rule but rather in the particular circumstances of this case his Honour ought not hear and determine the application for the applicant to withdraw her plea. Any other basis for recusal also remains open. 

70Accordingly, I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law that leave to appeal ought be refused. 

71McCLELLAN CJ at CL: That will be the order of the Court.

2760017,R v Bailey [2012] NSWSC 1074,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Sean Hai Bailey (the accused) has been charged with the murder of Allan Thomas Hall (the deceased).

2The charge arises from an incident in the Laurieton Hotel on the evening of Friday 20 August 2010. The Crown case is that he punched Mr Hall who was sitting on a bar stool watching friends who were about to play a game of pool. The Crown says that the punching caused damage to a vertebral artery which bled into the base of the brain causing a subarachnoid haemorrhage that quickly resulted in death. 

The proceedings 

3The accused was arrested almost immediately. He agreed to be interviewed and was then charged. He was committed for trial to this Court on 9 June 2011. A question was raised as to his fitness to stand trial. On 11 October 2011, Garling J determined that he was unfit to be tried: R v Bailey [2011] NSWSC 1228. In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act) his Honour referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) and remanded the accused in custody pending the determination of the Tribunal pursuant to s 16 of the Act.

4Unfitness to be tried means that the accused has an inability to meet a minimum standard of mental capacity to be tried fairly; that there is a limitation on the ability of the accused to participate in or contribute to his defence: Subramaniam v R [2004] HCA 51; (2004) 211 ALR 1 at [40].

5On 29 March 2012 the Tribunal determined that the accused would not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried. The Tribunal notified the Court and the Director of Public Prosecutions of this determination. In a further review on 3 August 2012 it remained the determination of the Tribunal that the accused had not become fit to be tried and would not do so in the 12 months following the determination of unfitness by Garling J.

6The Director of Public Prosecutions determined pursuant to s 19 of the Act to take further proceedings in the matter. That then required the Court to conduct a special hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the accused to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that he is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged: s 19(2) of the Act.

7Section 21A of the Act requires that a special hearing is to be conducted by a judge alone unless an election is made by either the prosecution or the defence for there to be a jury. No such election was made in this case.

8If there had been a jury, I would have been required by the provisions of s 21(4) to explain certain aspects relating to the accused being unfit to be tried and the nature and consequences of a special hearing, including the verdicts which are available. The High Court of Australia provided a suggested direction to comply with this requirement in Subramaniam v R at [40]. I have re-read that passage of the judgment in order to remind myself of the various matters that a lay tribunal of fact would be required to have drawn to their attention.

9The verdicts available at a special hearing are provided in s 22(1) of the Act. They are:

(a)Not guilty of the offence charged.

(b)Not guilty on the ground of mental illness.

(c)That on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged.

(d)That on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.

10As to the latter, manslaughter is, of course, an alternative verdict available where there is a charge of murder. Whether it is open for the tribunal of fact to return such an alternative verdict depends upon the facts of the case at hand. There is no issue between the parties that it is available in this case.

11As there has been an issue in this special hearing as to whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of the incident in question there are some further provisions of the Act that should be noted. 

12If there had been a jury, I would have been required by s 37 to explain the findings that may be made and the legal and practical consequences of those findings. Such an explanation would have included reference to the existence and composition of the Mental Health Review Tribunal and its functions with respect to forensic patients. That, in turn, would have included reference to the requirements of the Act that the Tribunal may make an order for the release of a person detained pursuant to s 39 following a special verdict returned pursuant to s 38 only if the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release. I do not intend to set out all of the matters that are relevant to these issues but simply record that I have reminded myself of those matters.

Elements of the offence

13To establish a charge of murder the Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a deliberate act of the accused that caused the death; that such act was done with an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm (really serious physical injury) or with reckless indifference to human life; and that the act was not carried out in self-defence.

14In this case the Crown alleges that the act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased was accompanied by an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. There has been no suggestion that it was carried out in self-defence.

15The Crown contends that if it has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the act was accompanied by that intention, a verdict for manslaughter arises for consideration. That requires the Crown to prove that there was a deliberate act by the accused that caused death and that such act was unlawful and dangerous.

16It has been submitted that the evidence establishes at least that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased and that this act was an unlawful and dangerous one. There is no suggestion of there having been any lawful excuse for the accused to have punched the deceased. Punching the deceased was dangerous if a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that by that act the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. It has not been submitted that there is any doubt about the latter.

17On the accused's behalf the defence of mental illness has been raised. This requires that the accused persuade the court on the balance of probabilities that as a result of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind he did not appreciate the nature and quality of his act of punching Mr Hall, or that he did not know that it was wrong. When I speak of a disease of the mind I am talking about the function of the accused's reason, memory or understanding being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. This must involve his capacity to reason so that he did not know the physical nature or quality of the act, or that he did no know that the act was wrong; wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in the community.

Matters not in dispute

18There has been no issue as to the following matters.

19The accused suffers from a mental illness. I will say more about this later.

20At the Laurieton Hotel at about 7.35pm on 20 August 2010 the accused approached the deceased who was sitting on a bar stool with his back to a wall and feet up off the ground. He was watching two friends who were about to play a game of pool. The accused spoke briefly with him and shook his hand. He then immediately delivered at least one blow with a clenched left fist to the right side of the deceased's head.

21There is no dispute that the act of punching the deceased was both unlawful and dangerous in the sense described above.

22The accused's motive was that he believed, mistakenly, that the deceased had made a racially offensive remark to the accused's mother some three weeks previously. Such a remark had been made, but someone else, not the deceased, made it.

23The accused was immediately grabbed by hotel patrons, brought to the ground and restrained. Some of the patrons immediately afforded first aid to the deceased. Police and ambulance officers arrived a short time later. Sadly, the deceased had passed away.

24The direct cause of death was ascertained on autopsy examination to be a subarachnoid haemorrhage; a large collection of blood at the base of the brain. The cause of this was bleeding from the upper right vertebral artery. The cause of the damage to this artery is in issue and I will return to it. Another significant condition contributing to the death was aspiration; choking by inhaling food material that was in the stomach, something that occurs to a person when they are unconscious.

25The accused was arrested and taken to Port Macquarie police station. Whilst he was in custody he was taken to Port Macquarie Hospital for treatment to a head wound that he sustained when the hotel patrons brought him to the ground. He was returned to the police station where he agreed to be interviewed by detectives. His father was present as a support person. He made admissions as to assaulting the deceased in the manner and for the reason indicated above.

Issues to be determined

26There are a number of issues that remain to be determined


(1)Was it the act of the accused in punching the deceased that caused death?


(2)Did the accused intend to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased?


(3)Is the defence of mental illness made out?

The defence of mental illness

27I propose to deal with these issues in a slightly different order. I will deal first with whether the defence of mental illness has been established, although it will only be relevant if the Crown has proved either murder or manslaughter.

28There is an abundance of evidence that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the incident. There is evidence from his brother and sister that in the days leading up to it his mental state was deteriorating and they were concerned about him. Efforts were made to have him seen and treated. There is no need for me to trace this evidence in detail; suffice to say that their efforts were, tragically, unsuccessful.

29There is evidence that the accused's behaviour in the hours following the incident was consistent with him suffering from a deterioration of his mental condition. After he was arrested he was taken to the Port Macquarie police station. Because he had sustained a wound to the back of his head as a result of the efforts of hotel patrons to apprehend him it became necessary for police officers to take him to the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. 

30One of the officers, Sergeant John Lawrie, said that on the way to the hospital the accused was very vague. He sat quietly in the rear of the ambulance staring straight ahead. At the hospital he was mumbling things to himself and making hand gestures. He was placed in a safe room where he was observed to be talking to himself, making hand gestures to the walls, laughing out loud for no apparent reason, and having conversations with himself about a range of topics. Sergeant Lawrie said that the accused appeared oblivious to the fact that police were standing near the doorway observing him. It was necessary for a doctor to insert about six staples to the site of the wound to the accused's head after administration of a local anaesthetic injection. Throughout the treatment the accused was laughing uncontrollably. 

31Sergeant Lawrie recorded some video footage on his mobile phone and this recording was tendered by the Crown (Exhibit K). It is consistent with the descriptions given of the accused's behaviour.

32Dr Sarah Beable was the treating doctor. Her statement (Exhibit U) includes that the accused ""was constantly talking to himself and appeared to be acting out in an unusual manner"". When left alone in a room he ""still remained ... vacant and talking to himself"". Another doctor who took over the treatment of the accused noted that the accused was laughing loudly and talking to himself, but denied reacting to auditory/visual hallucinations. 

33The police interview commenced almost 11 hours after the incident at the hotel. I have had the benefit of watching the visual recording (Exhibit W). It shows behaviour by the accused that is consistent with someone experiencing a significant deterioration of mental health. He appears to have had no appreciation of the serious situation he was in. He often smiled and on occasion laughed. His admissions to having punched the deceased were given in a quite determined and matter of fact style. At one point (Q 162) he began to sing. At another point (Q 207-208) he expressed interest in the microphone on the interview table, commenting that it was ""a nice one"". A number of times he took on a vacant appearance as if he was not aware of his surroundings and was in a world of his own. 

34Professor David Greenberg saw the accused in custody on 30 March 2011 and 1 and 12 August 2011. His report of 26 August 2011 is Exhibit J. 

35Professor Greenberg reported that the accused gave a poor account of his past psychiatric history. He said that he was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1998. He gave a history of hospitalisations and treatment in the community but claimed that there had been a misdiagnosis and that he was not mentally ill at all. 

36The report includes in summary form Professor Greenberg's review of a number of witness statements and hospital records. He stated his conclusions thus:

Mr Bailey has a documented chronic history of suffering from a major psychiatric illness, namely a Schizoaffective Disorder. It is reported that his first psychotic episode was in 1998 and he subsequently had at least eight known admissions to various Psychiatric Units or Psychiatric Hospitals for his psychotic illness. His admissions were precipitated by his non-compliance with his psychiatric medication. It is noted in the medical records from Royal North Shore Hospital and Port Macquarie Mental Health Services that Mr Bailey had a history of violent behaviour whilst in a psychotic state. During periods of psychosis he had elevated mood with decreased need for sleep. He also presented with agitation and grandiose plans to start various businesses whilst in a psychotic state.

According to the information available, Mr Bailey's medication was decreased from approximately February 2010. His intramuscular medication, namely Fluanxol was decreased and finally ceased at the end of March 2010. He had also ceased his mood stabilizing oral medication, namely Sodium Valproate at this time period.

It is noted that Mr Bailey's mental state was subsequently stable for several weeks until July 2010 when there was noted signs of deterioration in his mental state. It is noted in the medical records that his Fluanxol intramuscular antipsychotic medication was subsequently restarted on 9 July 2010; and further small doses were given on 14 July and 22 July 2010; he was due for a further injection of 80 milligrams on 4 August 2010.

It is noted that whilst in Sydney Mr Bailey was reported by his father, sister, brother and mother to have symptoms and signs of a relapse of his Schizoaffective illness. It is reported that he had decreased need for sleep, was laughing to himself and staring vacantly into space. He appeared being preoccupied with his thoughts and also had grandiose ideas about starting businesses. The family recognized that heir family member was deteriorating in his mental state and attempted to seek help from the Royal North Short Hospital and Port Macquarie Base Hospital.

I am therefore of the opinion that Mr Bailey suffers from a major psychiatric illness, namely a Schizoaffective Disorder and at the time of the alleged offence was suffering from an acute relapse of his Schizoaffective Disorder.

37The report then addresses specifically the defence of mental illness:

I am of the opinion that Mr Bailey likely has a 'Defence of Mental Illness'. I base my opinion on the documentation from various family members and medical personnel at Royal North Short Hospital and Port Macquarie Base Hospital in the weeks just prior to the alleged offence, the police officers observations after detaining the accused and the statements from the various witnesses. It is evident that at the time period of the alleged offence, he had an acute relapse of his Schizoaffective Disorder. I am of the opinion that he was suffering from a disease of the mind, namely a Schizoaffective Disorder with acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms at that time period of the alleged offence.

I note that following his arrest and interview by the police it is evidenced in the transcript of the ERISP and in the same video recording that Mr Bailey was highly inappropriate in his manner. He is noted to be laughing to himself and at times preoccupied with his thoughts. At times he is noted to be staring vacantly when asked questions by the police officer. He appears to be either preoccupied with his psychotic thoughts or responding to auditory hallucinations. During interview he appears not to understand the nature and quality of the charges. He dismisses that his actions were wrong and feels justified that he hit the victim. He appears not to understand the implications of his admissions of punching the victim. At times he appears to have the perception that he is on TV and also comments on the microphone on the desk in an inappropriate manner. These examples of his mental state would suggest that he was acutely psychotic at that time period.

Various witnesses noted in their statements that Mr Bailey appeared to be calm and un-phased that the victim was deceased as a result of his alleged behaviour at the time period. In my psychiatric interview, Mr Bailey claimed that he believed that the victim and his two friends were going to attack him and beat him. He felt that he was justified in punching the victim to stave off the attack.

I am therefore of the opinion that Mr Bailey likely did not understand the nature and quality of his actions and did not understand the wrongfulness of his action both in a legal sense and a moral sense at that time period. I am of the opinion that he had a defect of reason flowing from his mental illness namely Schizoaffective Disorder. At the time he was suffering from paranoid delusional beliefs and likely was hallucinating at that time period.

I am therefore of the opinion that Mr Bailey has a 'Defence of Mental Illness'.

38There was no expert evidence contradicting Professor Greenberg's opinion. The Crown accepts it to be correct. I have no basis not to act upon it; indeed, it would be capricious not to.

Evidence as to causation

39Principles relating to the issue of causation in the criminal law were discussed by the High Court of Australia in Royall v R [1991] HCA 27; (1991) 172 CLR 378 and recently by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Whelan v R [2012] NSWCCA 147. Allsop P (at [2]) succinctly described the issue thus:

The question is one of fact, dealt with by commonsense, appreciating that the purpose of the enquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter, and so the causal connection must be sufficiently substantial to permit a conclusion of criminal responsibility.

40The first task is to determine the facts. Only then can it be determined whether it was the act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased.

41The dispute between the parties on this issue comes down to this. Was the damage to the vertebral artery directly caused by a punch, or punches, delivered by the accused? Or, is it a reasonable possibility that such damage was occasioned when hotel patrons intervened to restrain the accused? It has been suggested that it is a reasonable alternative possibility that the deceased sustained the damage to the artery when he became inadvertently caught up in the ensuing fracas.

42There are four aspects of the evidence that assist with the determination of what happened: security camera footage, physical evidence, expert opinions of the forensic pathologist and eyewitness testimony.

Security camera footage

43The area of the hotel in question is rectangular in shape. The security camera was installed approximately in the northeast corner and was generally directed towards the middle of the wall on the opposite, southern side. The vision provided is across two table tennis tables with a pool table the other side of them in the middle of the screen. There is another pool table further to the right.

44It is the pool table in the middle of the screen that is of interest. Vision from the security camera sees the table at an angle. The longest sides of the pool table run parallel with the far (southern) wall of the room. With the aid of a crime scene officer's scale plan and working notes (Exhibits P and Q) it can be determined that there is a distance of about metre and a half between that wall and the pool table.

45The table at which the deceased was sitting was against the southern wall and is about half a metre in diameter. There were stools near to the wall on either side of it. The table was opposite the eastern end of the pool table; at the left hand end of it as viewed from the security camera.

46Also against the southern wall was a chip vending machine. It was to the west of the table in question, or to the right as viewed from the security camera. The distance from the middle of the table to the closest side of the chip machine is about three metres. The distance between the southwest corner of the pool table and the north east corner of the chip machine is about 90cm.

47There was evidence that the time stamp on the security camera footage was about 20 minutes in advance of actual time so I have deducted 20 minutes from the displayed time.

48At 7.34.37 Mr Phillip Hardy is seen to approach the pool table from the main bar area. Mr Jimmy Waters similarly approached at 7.35.10. They both appeared to put their beers on the table and then directed their attention to the pool table. It was their intention to have a game.

49At 7.36.13 the deceased approached the area of the pool table. He took a seat on the stool to the north of the table, or to the left as viewed from the security camera.

50At 7.36.47 the accused comes into view, approaching from the main bar area. Messrs Hardy and Waters at that point were in the vicinity of the table at which the deceased was sitting. Mr Hardy walked anticlockwise around the pool table and came together with the approaching accused at about the middle of the northern, or camera, side of the pool table. This was at 7.36.54. The deceased remained seated on the stool with Mr Waters standing a short distance in front of him.

51At 7.36.59 the accused continued to walk clockwise around the pool table in the direction of Mr Waters and the deceased while Mr Hardy continued walking anticlockwise around the pool table to the western, or baulk end of it. This is consistent with his evidence that he and Mr Waters were about to have a game of pool and Mr Hardy was to break.

52The accused came to Mr Waters who was still standing a short distance in front of the deceased. The two appear to shake hands, which is consistent with the oral evidence.

53At 7.37.03 the accused moved around and past Mr Waters and approached the deceased who was still sitting on the stool. At 7.37.05 the accused was directly in front of the deceased. At 7.37.11 there is movement by the accused towards the deceased. It is not possible to see that this movement was a punch, but it is consistent with it. It is not possible to discern that there was anything more than the one movement by the accused, a matter relevant to the assessment of Mr Waters' evidence that he saw two punches in quick succession. 

54The ensuing events occurred very quickly. The deceased came forward off the stool, slightly bent over from the waist. Whether he was grabbing at the accused, or the accused had hold of him, or neither, is not possible to discern. At this point Mr Hardy immediately moved to his right (left as viewed from the camera) anticlockwise around the pool table in the direction of the incident. Mr Waters took two or three steps back away from the accused and the deceased as the latter came off the stool.

55The deceased and the accused then move to the right as viewed from the camera. Vision of them is immediately lost as they move into an area between the pool table and the far wall that is very brightly lit. It is impossible to say that, if they were in contact as the deceased came off the stool, they remained in contact as they disappear from vision into the brightly lit area behind the pool table.

56At 7.37.14 Mr Waters moved forward to the area behind the pool table and vision of him is lost. It is certainly the case that Mr Hardy and Mr Waters were the first to reach the area towards where the deceased and the accused had gone. Their evidence was that they were focussed upon restraining the accused.

57By 7.37.33, eight men had gone to the area of the pool table; four coming from the left side of the screen (the northern end of the room) and the others from right side of the screen from the area of the main bar. These men congregated around the furthest (southwest) corner of the pool table.

58At 7.37.50 the accused can be seen (particularly because of his distinctive white shoes) walking at a normal pace away from the pool table, towards the main bar to the right of the screen.

59The first police officer on the scene was Senior Constable Dietrich. He can be seen by at least 7.48.35. Ambulance officers can be seen arriving at 7.50.30.

60There was evidence that the pool table was moved to allow better access to the deceased by those seeking to provide assistance. The right hand end, as viewed from the security camera, was rotated away from the far wall and that is how it appears in the photographs subsequently taken by the crime scene officer.

The physical evidence

61The body of the deceased is not seen on the security camera footage. The crime scene officer's plan and photographs (Exhibits P and B respectively) show that he was lying roughly parallel to the far wall with his head to the right and feet to the left, as viewed from the security camera. The knees were very close to the area of the far corner of the pool table before it was moved; if they were not in contact with the leg of the table they must have been very close to it. The head was approximately just over half a metre from the nearest (northeast) corner of the chip machine. There is evidence that the deceased was moved by persons who sought to assist him from the position he was in initially when he went to the ground; references ranged from rolling him over but in the same location to lifting him up and moving him to a different location. As a result, it is not possible to conclude anything from the position of the body except that one would expect that any movement would not have involved any great distance. 

62The table at which the deceased was sitting was not disturbed and nor were the stools on either side of it. There were three schooner glasses of beer on the table with only about a mouthful consumed out of each. There was a single leg to the table and it seems reasonable to assume that it was in some fashion fixed to the floor. So, it maybe that in the movement of the deceased away from the table there was some contact with it, but it was probably minimal at best given the beers were not disturbed.

63A matter of some significance in the submissions for the accused is the chip vending machine. Photographs 70 and 71 (Exhibit B) show the lower portion of the side closest to the table at which the deceased was sitting. The crime scene officer's description includes that ""there was visible damage observed to the bottom edge of the eastern side of the vending machine"" (Exhibit A at [21]). The photographs show something that might be damage but it very minor. The officer also described a light coloured hair being located in the damage and that can be seen in photograph 71. Reference was made in the course of submissions for the accused to the deceased having light coloured hair and the accused having black hair. The deceased's glasses were found on the floor very close to this area of damage to the machine.

64The crime scene officer's evidence was that she took a swab from the area of the bottom of the chip vending machine and she seized the hair. For some unknown reason they were never submitted for analysis. The accused may have been disadvantaged because of this; I understand the submission made on his behalf to be that analysis might have confirmed that the deceased had been in contact with the bottom of the machine as the hair was consistent with the colour of his hair.

Forensic pathologist's evidence

65Dr Kasinathan Nadesan conducted an autopsy at the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine on 23 August 2010. He determined that the cause of death was as I have indicated earlier. It is important to refer to some other matters that he found upon his examination.

66Superficial abrasions, bruising and subcutaneous contusions were found in various areas which need not be considered further as no-one has suggested that they are significant. What was significant was a contusion of the upper border of the right ear with a small superficial laceration on the top of the ear. The underlying scalp, which is under the skin, was bruised over an area of 6cm by 6cm.

67Dr Nadesan said it was not uncommon to find that a blunt impact occurring on the upper outer part of the neck, on either side, will cause damage to the upper vertebral artery causing bleeding into the base of the skull under the brain, that is, into the subarachnoid space. The doctor said that it was a logical conclusion in this case that a blunt heavy impact on the upper right side of the deceased's neck was the cause. This conclusion was based upon the external injuries seen on the right ear and the bleeding involving the entire thickness of the scalp in that area. This corresponded with the bleeding from the right vertebral artery and the subarachnoid haemorrhage. In other words, the scalp bruising, the contusion of the ear and the subsequent bleeding from the vertebral artery were all interrelated.

68Dr Nadesan also said that death is ""quite rapid"" when a subarachnoid haemorrhage occurs; the person usually collapses within a matter of seconds. Cessation of breathing is almost immediate and that causes the heart to stop because there is no oxygenation. A further aggravating feature in this case was the aspiration; the air passages were blocked which further compromised respiratory distress. 

69Of some significance in relation to the alternative hypotheses advanced by counsel for the accused is that there were no injuries to the left side of the body, nor any to the right shoulder or the top and back of the head. Dr Nadesan also said that the part of the upper right neck where the trauma was noted is protected; if one was to fall to the ground the force would usually be absorbed by the tip of the shoulder and, presumably, the side of the head.

70Another means by which an upper vertebral artery can be damaged so as to cause bleeding leading to a subarachnoid haemorrhage is by lateral rotation of the head, such as when an inept chiropractor might perform such a manipulation of the neck. In cross-examination Dr Nadesan said that ""a violent movement of the head along the upper vertebrae"" by way of a lateral or sideward rotation through the head rotating quickly could cause the upper vertebral artery damage. At another point in the cross-examination he said that ""abrupt and rapid movement""; ""rapid rotation of the head on the neck"" would be required.

71Versions derived from the eyewitness testimony were put to Dr Nadesan. A description of the deceased having been hit with a fist to the right side of the head and then collapsing to his knees slowly was consistent with a subarachnoid haemorrhage occurring. A description of the deceased going down to the floor without attempting to break his fall was consistent with him being unconscious.

72Dr Nadesan was asked about the degree of force that would be required to cause the trauma seen to the deceased's upper right neck. He said ""it has to be substantial force""; ""heavy impact"", ""a full blown punch"".

73A number of alternative explanations for the deceased's injuries were put to Dr Nadesan in cross-examination. As to the contusion to the upper tip of the right ear he agreed that contact with a broad hard surface, ""perhaps"" might be the cause. He disagreed that it was consistent with contact with the edge of a hard surface. He agreed that the bruising underneath the area of the ear was consistent with that area of the ear impacting with a solid surface. 

74Counsel for the accused showed photographs 23, 25, 70 and 71 from Exhibit B to Dr Nadesan and asked him to assume that the deceased's head came into contact with the bottom of the chip vending machine. With that assumption, he was asked whether the injury to the tip of the right ear and the underlying bruising were consistent with that part of the head having come into contact with that surface. Dr Nadesan had difficulty envisaging how contact with the area in question could have occurred if the deceased fell and contacted the bottom of the machine; he would have expected contact to have been made with a more upper region of the head (the parietal eminence) and the shoulder but there was no injuries to either of those areas. 

75When asked to assume that the area in question did come into contact with the bottom of the chip machine, Dr Nadesan agreed that the kind of injury the deceased sustained was possible.

76Another possibility put to Dr Nadesan was that as hotel patrons tackled the accused they also collected the deceased and so there was additional force placed on him as he moved towards the ground. He was asked to consider whether damage to the vertebral artery by way of a rotational injury sustained in that way was possible. In response he said that some kind of rotational force would need to be considered as the cause if it were not for the injury seen to the right ear and the underlying bruising. He maintained that his conclusion that the artery was damaged as a result of blunt impact to the side of the head was a logical one that took into account all of the findings made at autopsy.

77Dr Nadesan was then asked to assume that the punch, or punches, did not cause the injury to the ear or the underlying bruising but that the area of the right ear came into contact with the base of the chip machine. He agreed that it was a possibility that the damage to the vertebral artery could have been caused in that way.

78He was then asked to assume that the deceased fell in an awkward position into the chip machine and that this caused his head to move in a particular direction, causing damage through the rotational effect to the right vertebral artery. He agreed that was possible. 

79Finally he was asked to assume that the punch, or punches, did not cause any injury but that the damage to the tip of the ear and the underlying bruising were caused by contact with the bottom of the chip machine which also caused a rotation of the head, causing damage to the right vertebral artery. He agreed that was possible. 

80Counsel later returned to the scenario of the contusion to the right ear and underlying bruising being caused by contact with the bottom of the chip machine. Dr Nadesan reiterated his puzzlement as to how the right side of the upper neck and ear area could come to squarely strike the vertical side of the vending machine. But, on the assumption that this happened, he again agreed that it was a possible cause of the contusion and bruising.

81Dr Nadesan's last words on these subjects were:

My personal impression is it is a sort of, sort of a vertical [which I take to mean perpendicular] impact in this area [region of the right ear and behind it], like a fist blow is the most likely thing in my mind. I will definitely support that theory more than the other possibilities. (T245.5) 

82Dr Nadesan was recalled the following day for further cross-examination. He was first asked to assume that a punch to the right side of the head caused the damage to the vertebral artery and asked whether the angle at which the punch was delivered mattered. He said that whether the punch was perpendicular to the side of the head or slightly upward or slightly downward did not matter so long as substantial force was transferred onto that area to cause the damage.

83He was then asked to assume that the punch did not cause the contusion and underlying bruising and asked whether they could have been caused by contact with the bottom of the chip machine whether the head struck it horizontally, diagonally downwards or diagonally upwards or otherwise. He expressed significant reservations about such a possibility because he had not seen the machine itself and reminded the court of the reservations he had expressed the previous day about such a scenario. Nevertheless, he agreed that it was a possibility but concluded his answer by saying, ""this is purely a theoretical sort of answer from me, your Honour"".

84Next, Dr Nadesan was asked to assume that a punch to the right side of the head caused the contusion and underlying bruising. He agreed it was possible that the vertebral artery was not consequentially damaged; although he also reiterated that it was his conclusion that it was. 

85Finally, he was again asked about the possibility of the contusion and bruising being caused by a punch but that the vertebral artery damage was caused by rotation of the head and neck as the deceased made his way to the ground, or towards the chip machine. He said, ""Yes, if you could prove the scenario. Yes, it's a possibility"".

86In re-examination, Dr Nadesan agreed that a person being struck and then collapsing was consistent with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. He also agreed that a person being struck, going to his knees, witnesses noticing blood trickling, an open mouth, an appearance of unconsciousness and just falling to the ground, was consistent with a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Eyewitness testimony

87It is often the case when incidents that are traumatic occur without warning and quickly, that the testimony of eyewitnesses varies greatly. Some people focus more quickly upon the incident than others; some may pay greater attention to some aspects than others; and some may simply be so affected by the trauma that they have difficulty in mentally processing what they have seen. A factor that may further exacerbate the problem in this case is that a number of the witnesses were consuming alcohol. That is to be expected given the scene was a hotel but there is a question as to the extent to which their ability to observe and recall was affected for this reason. There is no question concerning the honesty of any of the witnesses. Accuracy and reliability are in question.

88Eleven people who were either patrons or members of staff of the hotel were called to give evidence. I do not believe it is necessary to review their evidence in detail. The security camera footage provides the most reliable record of the basic facts as to what occurred. To reiterate, Mr Hall was seated on a stool watching his companions who were about to play a game of pool. The accused approached, spoke briefly with him, and then lunged at him, by inference punched him. The deceased and the accused then moved to the right, generally in the direction of the chip vending machine. Mr Hall was on the floor and found to be deceased very shortly afterwards.

89The various eyewitness accounts were the bases of scenarios put to Dr Nadesan. 

90Mr Phillip Hardy was involved in tackling the accused and bringing him to the ground. Once the accused was restrained he looked back and saw the deceased. He said that he was in distress, his breathing was not right, he was gasping or struggling to breathe. There was a trickle of blood down the right side of his face. In his police statement made that night he said that ""Al slowly went down to his knees and I went over to his side. Jimmy [Waters] and I helped Al to the ground and put him on his back"".

91Dane Gunning gave an account which included three versions as to what occurred. I do not propose to have any regard to his evidence. 

92Michael Moore was involved in restraining the accused. He looked back and saw the deceased on his knees; he wasn't looking good; there was blood coming down the right side of his head; his mouth was open as if he was in a state of unconsciousness; he was on his knees, not looking around or anything like that. This is quite consistent with the account of Mr Hardy.

93Whilst every witness said something that could be shown objectively to be incorrect, Daniel Dunn's evidence, like Mr Gunning's evidence, contained too many inconsistencies to warrant serious consideration. I will cite just the one example. He said that two people tackled the accused but that the deceased got caught up in this and he ended up on the bottom, that is, with three people on top of him. However, when asked if the deceased could have been ""a bit further back and separate from those people"" he said, ""Yep, definitely"".

94Mr Dunn's brother Joshua, also had the deceased on the ground with the accused and he said that Mr Hardy came and ""smothered"" both of them. He said Mr Hardy had pulled the accused off. He then said that the deceased was on his knees facing the corner where the chip vending machine backed on to the wall. Joshua Dunn had said that the man he described who was obviously the accused had earlier been playing pool with Mr Hardy. There are too many discrepancies in his evidence to know what can be relied upon.

95Mathew Owers, a barman, was a more impressive witness. He was working behind the bar when he heard a commotion. He looked up and saw a group of people crashing into the chip machine. He said there were ""about"" four people and that they then wrestled on the ground. One of them was Mr Hardy. Mr Owers raced around the bar and over to the scene. When he arrived he saw three men holding the accused down. The deceased was elsewhere, a little bit further back, about one and half metres towards the road (left as viewed from the security camera). He saw him drop to the ground on his knees and gag for air. He then fell forward onto the floor. He also saw blood coming from a cut around the right temple (it will be recalled that Mr Hall sustained a small contusion to the tip of the right ear).

96Scott Van Den Hoof said prior to the incident he had noticed the deceased playing pool (which, of course, he had not). He looked up from texting on his phone when he heard an exchange between the accused and the deceased. He saw the deceased had left his chair and seemed to be tackling the accused; they were up against the pool table. The deceased had his shoulder in the stomach area of the accused and his arms and shoulders were around the accused's stomach. Then another man who was playing pool came and tackled both of them and they ended upon the floor near the chip machine. Mr Van Den Hoof got up from his table and went over. He saw the accused on the ground with two people on top of him. The deceased was away from them, up against the chip machine. He was on his knees, slumped forwards onto the floor, but he added that this was not a clear memory. This aspect of his account is, however, consistent with that of Joshua Dunn.

97Michael Falconer said that he saw the accused punch the deceased with his right hand, although he did not actually see the blow land. The deceased got up off his stool and the two commenced to wrestle. The two people who had been playing pool were not there at this time (Mr Hardy and Mr Waters); one had gone to the toilet and he did not know where the other one was. (The security camera footage shows the contrary). Two people rushed to intervene, but they were not the two who had been playing pool. All four men went to the ground. The accused was on the bottom, with the deceased on top of him, and the other two men on top of him. Mr Falconer said that the deceased hit his head on the chip machine: ""when they fell over it was just big bang where he's hit"". He was asked how he knew it was the deceased and he said ""I couldn't be sure but looked like him"". In response to further questions he struggled to explain how it was possible for him to discern that it was the deceased's head that hit the machine. Another curiosity about Mr Falconer's evidence is that he said the deceased had a cut on his neck; he could not say which side; it was not bleeding, it was an open wound. No such injury was detected by Dr Nadesan.

98Mr James Waters gave a clear account of what he saw, although, like everyone else, there were certain inconsistencies. He was the person about to play pool with Mr Hardy when the accused approached. He was closest to the two when the accused punched the deceased to the right side of his face. He claimed that there was a second punch in quick succession; something that nobody else saw and something that is not possible to discern in the security camera footage. Mr Waters combined with Mr Hardy in grabbing the accused and bringing him to the ground. He looked over to the deceased and saw that he was on the ground some one to two metres away. There was blood on his face. He was not up against the chip vending machine. This is broadly consistent with the versions of Mr Hardy and Mr Moore.

Conclusion as to causation 

99I have carefully considered the alternative possibilities suggested on behalf of the accused as to how the deceased's upper vertebral artery came to be damaged and bled, causing the subarachnoid haemorrhage which quickly led to death. I am not persuaded that any of the alternative scenarios are reasonably possible. Like Dr Nadesan, I simply cannot envisage the right upper neck of the deceased coming into contact with the bottom of the chip machine in a manner that would cause the injury. Similarly, there is nothing in the eyewitness testimony that provides a foundation for the possibility that the deceased's head was abruptly rotated, either by contact with the machine or through physical manhandling in a way that could have damaged the artery.

100There is support for Dr Nadesan's opinion that the artery was damaged as a direct result of the accused's punch. It was described by some of the witnesses as quite a forceful punch. Most descriptions of the blow have it landing roughly in the region where the contusion and underlying bruising was found. Descriptions such as that of Mr Hardy and Mr Moore of seeing the deceased slumped to his knees, gasping for air and the like are consistent with the damage already having been done. 

101I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the fatal injuries were sustained as a direct result of a very forceful punch by the accused.

An intention to cause grievous bodily harm?

102The Crown relied upon three aspects of the evidence to support the proposition that at the time the accused struck the deceased he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. They were the accused's physical actions, what he said in his police interview and what he said to people at the scene. 

103In the police interview the accused said that he had been told by his mother three weeks previously that the deceased had made a racially offensive comment to her. He was ""pissed off"" and ""very upset about it"". He vowed to ""get him""; ""I'm gunna get that one"". He said that when he saw the deceased in the hotel, which was the first time that he had seen him since he had heard what his mother had alleged, he thought to himself ""that's it, I'm gunna get him"". There was in fact evidence from Mr Hardy that something like half an hour before the incident the accused became aware that Mr Hall was in the hotel; he walked past and said ""G'day"".

104The accused told the police that he went outside and put his glasses down before re-entering the hotel. There was evidence that the accused's glasses and his leftover Chinese meal that he had been carrying were found on an outdoor table. The accused said that he then immediately went to where the deceased was near the pool table and ""king-hit"" him. He said that after asking the deceased whether he had called his mother a ""slaphead"" and a ""gook"" he went ""bang, king-hit"". He was asked how hard the punch was and he said ""I don't know, it was a good one though"". He was asked what he meant by the term ""king-hit"" and he said, ""Like, king-hit, cheap shot"". 

105A number of statements were made by the accused in the interview as to what his intention was. At first he said that he intended to kill him. Later he denied that but said his intention was to break his jaw. Counsel for the accused objected to those parts of the interview, relying upon ss 85 and 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. A voir dire was conducted. Submissions and my ruling on the objection were deferred. Prior to the issue being determined, the Crown conceded by agreeing to tender a version of the interview with all references to the accused's intention being redacted. Accordingly, I must ignore what the accused said in the interview on the subject.

106Descriptions by eyewitnesses as to the nature of the punch varied. Mr Hardy said it was not what he would call ""a savage punch""; ""it wasn't a well guided punch""; ""it was a hit to the side of the head, a fairly sort of lifting up shot"". I do not know what he meant by that. Mr Moore said ""you could hear it - a very, very good punch - if you were boxing you'd be pretty happy with it"". Mr Waters, as I have mentioned, said that there were two punches. I am doubtful about that because no-one else saw two punches and it is not possible to discern movements on the security camera footage that are consistent with that being the case. Nevertheless, as to the force of the punches, he said that when the first one hit he heard ""a thud"" and he thought the second punch was harder. Some of the other witnesses did not see the blow and others who did were unable to provide a description as to its force.

107Dr Nadesan's opinion was that the fatal injury was caused by ""blunt, heavy impact"". He said that such trauma as he observed required ""substantial force"", ""a heavy impact"". The descriptions of Mr Moore and Mr Waters were put to him and he agreed that they were consistent with the type of force that would be required, that is, ""a full blown punch"".

108The third aspect of the evidence referred to by the Crown was not developed further in submissions. What the accused said to people at the scene immediately after the incident was confined to the reasons why he punched the deceased, not what he intended to achieve by it. 

109The evidence as to what the accused told police and as to what he actually did persuades me that it is highly likely that he did intend to cause really serious injury to the deceased at the time he struck him. However, I am not satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt.

110The accused's stated intention to ""get"" the deceased could mean that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. It could also mean that he intend to hurt him in some way but not necessarily in a really serious way. The fact that he put his glasses down outside the hotel before going in to confront the deceased is also equivocal as to the degree of harm he might have had in mind. The force of the blow that he inflicted is the most compelling feature relied upon by the Crown. But, was his intention to hurt him, or did it go so far as an intention to inflict really serious bodily harm upon him? I am left with a doubt. The accused must be acquitted of murder.

111I am satisfied that the accused's actions amounted to an unlawful and dangerous act as I have earlier described. To punch a person without that person's consent amounts to an assault. A reasonable person in the accused's position would realise that punching someone hard to the side of the upper neck/head would expose that person to an appreciable risk of serious injury. On the limited evidence available I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all of the elements of manslaughter have been established.

112However, I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that because of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind the accused did not appreciate that what he did was wrong. Professor Greenberg was also of the opinion that the accused did not know the physical nature or quality of his act. I am hesitant in accepting that the accused did not know he was delivering a hard punch to the deceased's head. However, it is unnecessary to dwell upon that. The fact that the accused did not appreciate the wrongfulness of his act is sufficient for the defence to be made out.

Verdict 

113I return the following verdicts:


1. Not guilty of murder


2. Not guilty of manslaughter by reason of mental illness

114I make the following order: 


1. Sean Hai Bailey is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

		10 September 2012",2012-09-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760023,New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason Lee [2012] NSWCA 276,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 28 February 2011 RS Hulme J refused the appellant's application for orders that each of the respondents be examined on oath before a registrar of the Supreme Court concerning the affairs of the first respondent and a third person, pursuant to s 31D(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). The primary judge made orders that two other persons be examined, however, his Honour did not make an order otherwise dismissing the application.

One respondent's trial on money laundering charges was outstanding, and both respondents' appeals against conviction in respect of drug supply charges were pending.

The appellant appealed from the orders of the primary judge to this Court. The respondents tendered additional material in this Court revealing that records of interviews by the appellant pursuant to the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) had been made available to the prosecution in a District Court trial of the respondents.

The issues for determination on appeal were:

(i) whether this Court should make an order otherwise dismissing the application before the primary judge,
(ii) whether leave to appeal should be granted, and
(iii) whether orders for the examination of the respondents should be made.

The Court held, granting leave to appeal and allowing the appeal:

In relation to (i)

1. The failure of the primary judge to make an order otherwise dismissing the application was an oversight, and the parties treated the relevant order as having been made. The appropriate course is to make the order which should have been made: [15]-[16]

2. Given that the purpose of the order otherwise dismissing the application is to regularise steps which have been taken thereafter on the assumption that an order was made, it is appropriate that the order take effect on the date that the primary judge's orders were made, pursuant to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 36.4(3): [16]

In relation to (ii)

3. The disparity in curial approaches to statutory regimes for compulsory examination justifies a grant of leave to appeal: [23]

Hammond v Commonwealth of Australia [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188; Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; 185 FCR 258; R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264; New South Wales Crime Commission v Hung Sun Choi [2012] NSWSC 658 referred to.

In relation to (iii)

4. Under the general law, the Court will grant an injunction to restrain an inquiry undertaken in the exercise of executive power, it if carries with it a real risk that the conduct of the inquiry will interfere with the administration of justice in criminal proceedings. Such interference would constitute contempt of court and, accordingly, an injunction may lie to prevent a threatened contempt: [24]

Clough v Leahy [1904] HCA 38; 2 CLR 139; McGuinness v Attorney-General of Victoria [1940] HCA 6; 63 CLR 73; Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' & Builders Labourers' Federation [1982] HCA 31; 152 CLR 25 referred to.

5. The legislature may authorise a scheme of investigation and inquiry which has the potential to diminish common law protections for an accused in criminal proceedings. The question is one of statutory construction: does the relevant legislation authorise such conduct and, if so, to what extent?: [34]

6. The Criminal Assets Recovery Act does not condition the removal of the immunity from self-incrimination upon the existence or otherwise of outstanding criminal charges. The meaning purpose and structure of the Act indicates that the existence of criminal proceedings would rarely, if ever, be a basis of itself, for the Court to refuse to make an order for examination under s 31D. However, the Court might in the exercise of its discretion refuse to make an order under s 31D where criminal proceedings were on foot: [9]-[10], [43]

7. Given that s 63 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act provides that the fact of criminal proceedings is ""not a ground"" to stay an examination under s 31D, it should not be an available ground for resisting or delaying examination on any other procedural basis. The legislature has weighed competing public interests and has determined that the relevant powers should be conferred and should be available despite the possible consequences for an accused in criminal proceedings not yet completed: [46]-[49], [72]

Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486 referred to.

8. The respondents did not demonstrate an error in the approach of the majority in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; 185 FCR 258, accepted as correct by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264, at least with respect to the operation of the Australian Crime Commission Act. This Court would not decline to follow a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in these circumstances, unless persuaded that it was clearly wrong: [59], [65]

Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 referred to; R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 disapproved.

9. The legislative regime established by the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) is different and the State Act must be analysed on its own terms. The difference between the powers and function of an inquiry before an officer of the executive branch of government and an inquiry before a judicial officer of the Supreme Court has significant weight. Evidence as to what happened in respect of interviews conducted by the appellant in the exercise of executive power conferred by the New South Wales Crime Commission Act is of limited value in determining whether an order should be made for examination of the respondents under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act because of the differences between the statutory regimes: [63], [73], [79]-[80]

New South Wales Crime Commission v Hung Sun Choi [2012] NSWSC 658 referred to.

10. If the questions and answers given during an examination under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act would, were they to be revealed, prejudice a future criminal trial, there is no reason to suppose that a relevant order will not be made under s 8(1)(a) or (e) or both of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW). If a real risk of prejudice is revealed in the course of the conduct of the examination, the registrar before whom the examinations take place will have powers available to diminish or prevent that prejudice, to the extent that it is beyond the prejudice authorised by the Criminal Assets Recovery Act: [53]-[54], [62], [81], [100]-[101]

Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486 applied.

11. The appellant was, in the proper exercise of its functions, entitled to explore the possibility that the respondents held interests in property in other names. Further, there had been no dilatoriness or delay in the steps taken by the appellant, and the lapse of time did not provide a reason not to make the orders sought: [76]-[78], [80]





			Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: This is an application for leave to appeal by the New South Wales Crime Commission (Crime Commission) against the refusal by his Honour R S Hulme J to make an order under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, s 31D for the examination of the respondents before the Court or an officer of the Court. The application for leave to appeal and the appeal have been heard concurrently. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Basten JA, who proposes that the appeal be allowed and orders be made in respect of the examination of the respondents to the appeal. I agree with his Honour's proposed orders. Given his Honour's detailed consideration of the matter I am able to express my agreement with the proposed orders in short form.

2Basten JA has referred to a procedural difficulty in the matter. Although, in refusing to make an order under s 31D, the primary judge stated that no orders for the examination of the respondents should be made ""at this stage"", his Honour did not formalise this aspect of his judgment by any order in respect of these two respondents. Basten JA considers that this Court should make an order dismissing the application so as to formalise the proceedings both in the lower court and in this Court. In circumstances where the parties appear to have acted on the basis that was the order his Honour intended to make, I agree that it is appropriate to make an order in those terms. The application for leave to appeal and the appeal is thus against that order. 

3I agree for the reasons given by Basten JA that leave to appeal should be granted. 

4The respondents are persons against whom the Court has already made orders for the confiscation of property. Both respondents have been charged with and found guilty of offences following a criminal trial, although the trial had not occurred at the time that the primary judge heard the Crime Commission's application. The respondents have appealed against conviction. The appeal was listed for hearing on 23 August 2012. The first respondent is also due to face a further criminal trial for a money laundering offence. 

5I agree with Basten JA's analysis of Hammond v The Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188 and Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486 and as well as with his analysis of the authority in other courts. 

6I agree with Basten JA's identification of the error at [44]-[45] in the primary judge's approach to the exercise of his discretion: see House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. See also Whittaker v The King [1928] HCA 28; 41 CLR 230 at 242-243 per Isaacs J; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [77] ff per Allsop P. In passing I also refer to my comments in State of New South Wales v Plaintiff A [2012] NSWCA 248 at [2]-[3]. 

7As Basten JA points out, the Criminal Assets Recovery Act is an example of the lawful exercise of legislative power, the consequence of which is to interfere with established common law rights and, relevant to this case, the right against self-incrimination. In doing so, Parliament has carefully prescribed the parameters of interference: see, in particular, ss 13 and 13A, the latter provision being of concern in this case. I also agree with Basten JA that s 63 of the Act is relevant to the question in issue here, that is, whether the primary judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in not acceding to the Crime Commission's application for an order under s 31D. 

8The Criminal Assets Recovery Act, s 63, the full terms of which are set out in the reasons of Basten JA at [46] provides that the existence of criminal proceedings is not a ground on which the Supreme Court may stay proceedings under the Act. Apart from s 63, the Criminal Assets Recovery Act does not otherwise provide for or refer to a stay. Accordingly, s 63 must operate in cases where a stay is sought in respect of proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, as a limitation on the Court's discretionary power to order a stay. 

9It was suggested that his Honour's refusal to make an order was akin to a stay. That may be so, although there may be a question whether an application for an order under s 31D for the examination of a person is a proceeding to which s 63 applies or whether an order for an examination under the section is an ancillary power conferred on the court to achieve or further the objects of the Act. Those objects include ""enabl[ing] law enforcement authorities effectively to identify and recover property"": see s 3(c). Regardless of the correct answer to that question, the meaning purpose and structure of the Act indicates that the existence of criminal proceedings would rarely, if ever, be a basis of itself, for the Court to refuse to make an order for examination under s 31D. 

10However, the court might in the exercise of its discretion refuse to make an order under s 31D where criminal proceedings were on foot. This might occur where the person in respect of whom the order was the accused in a long trial that was then proceeding. The court may well consider it inappropriate to make an order at that time. In that circumstance, the court may make one of a number of orders. The two orders which most logically come to mind are to dismiss the application or to stand the application over to a future date. 

11No such circumstance was suggested as operating in this case, although as at the date of delivery of judgment by the primary judge, the criminal trial of both respondents was underway. It is not apparent from his Honour's reasons that he was aware of this as he did not advert to it. Rather, his concern was with the prejudice to the respondents by the potential use of derivative evidence. 

12Relevant error having been found, the question arises as to whether this Court should itself re-exercise the discretion. I agree for the reasons given by Basten JA that this Court should do so. I would only add that since preparing these reasons I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the reasons of Meagher JA with which I agree.

13McCOLL JA: I agree with Basten JA's reasons and the orders his Honour proposes.

14BASTEN JA: On 28 February 2011 RS Hulme J gave judgment refusing an application of the New South Wales Crime Commission (""the Commission"") for orders that the respondent Jason Lee be examined on oath before a registrar of the Court ""concerning his own affairs and including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest"", pursuant to s 31D(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). The Commission sought to examine the respondent Seong Won Lee about the affairs of Jason Lee (also known as Do Young Lee) and a third person believed to be an associate of Mr Jason Lee. The primary judge held that ""at this stage no orders for the examination of Jason Lee or Seong Won Lee should be made"": NSW Crime Commission v Lee [2011] NSWSC 80 at [21]. The Commission appeals against those decisions.

15The application for leave to appeal faces a preliminary difficulty: although the primary judge made orders that two persons be examined on the application of the Commission, he did not make orders in respect of the two respondents. Nor did he make an order 'otherwise dismissing' the Commission's notice of motion in which the orders were sought. It is apparent that this was an oversight, not noticed by anyone prior to the hearing of the application for leave to appeal in this Court. That the parties treated relevant orders as having been made appears on three bases. First, the respondents did not raise any objection to the competency of the application for leave to appeal. Secondly, before the hearing in this Court, the Commission renewed its application for such orders in the Common Law Division. The matter was heard by Garling J who noted that the orders sought are ""in effectively identical form to those orders sought from RS Hulme J and which RS Hulme J refused"": New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason Lee [2011] NSWSC 1037 at [23]. Garling J treated the fresh applications as an abuse of process and dismissed them: at [39]. Thirdly, and perhaps inevitably in the light of the forensic history, no party dissented from the view expressed at the hearing that the oversight could be remedied by this Court. 

16There is no question of varying or setting aside any order of the Court below: the appropriate course is to make the order which should have been made by RS Hulme J on 28 February 2011. Given that the purpose is to regularise steps which have been taken thereafter on the assumption that an order was made, it is appropriate that the order take effect on that date, pursuant to the powers conferred on the Court by Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 36.4(3). Accordingly, the Court should make the following order:

In addition to the orders made by RS Hulme J in the Common Law Division on 28 February 2011, order that the notice of motion filed by the Commission on 10 June 2010 be otherwise dismissed, such order to take effect from 28 February 2011.

Evidence on appeal
17On the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, the respondents sought to tender further evidence, pursuant to s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). The evidence related primarily to criminal proceedings in relation to the respondents which occurred after the hearing of the motion before RS Hulme J and partly in the period during which judgment was reserved (a period of eight months) and partly (namely the transcript of the hearing before Garling J) after judgment was delivered.

18The evidence was tendered primarily on the basis that, if leave were granted and the appeal upheld, the Court might itself exercise the power, if the exercise miscarried below. Senior counsel for the first respondent explained how the material would be relevant and as, for the reasons which follow, the Court should re-exercise the discretion which miscarried in the Common Law Division, there will be reference to relevant aspects of the evidence in due course.

19There was a brief affidavit in response read by the Commission and two documents were tendered in lieu of two paragraphs which constituted hearsay evidence. This material also will be referred to in relation to the re-exercise of the discretion.

Application for leave to appeal
20It was common ground that s 31D of the Recovery Act conferred a power on the primary judge of a kind which is sometimes described as ""discretionary"". It was not discretionary in the sense that a decision was to be made as to where, within a range of possible outcomes, the order should fall, as with sentencing, or the assessment of the degree of contributory negligence. Rather, there was a binary outcome possible (either an order was made or it was not), as a result of an evaluative judgment. The respondents contended that, even if error were established, it did not follow that the Court should make the order sought because, the decision being discretionary, no different order should be made ""merely because an appellate court would have exercised the discretion differently"". That raises a large question as to whether the powers of the Court under s 75A of the Supreme Court Act are so constrained, a proposition which would be inconsistent with the approach accepted by the High Court in Warren v Coombes [1979] HCA 9; 142 CLR 531; see also State of New South Wales v Plaintiff A [2012] NSWCA 248 at [19] and Eades v Gunestepe [2012] NSWCA 204 at [2]-[7]. However, it is appropriate to deal with the issues raised on the basis on which they were addressed by the parties, without reaching a view as to whether the Court enjoys wider powers than those accepted in the course of argument.

21At the heart of the reasoning of the primary judge was the proposition that the examination of the respondents prior to the determination of the criminal charges, without protection from self-incrimination, ""would create a real risk of interference with the administration of justice"", with the result that such an examination should not be permitted: at [16]. In support of that conclusion, the primary judge placed reliance on the decision of the High Court in Hammond v Commonwealth of Australia [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188. He declined to apply the reasoning of the majority of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; 185 FCR 258 on the basis that the statutory scheme of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) differed in material respects from the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. 

22The application for leave to appeal was first listed before a three judge bench in December 2011. However, against the possibility that the Court considered the primary judge was in error in failing to follow Australian Crime Commission v OK, the respondents sought leave to challenge the correctness of that decision and sought the constitution of a five judge bench for that purpose. On 9 December 2011 the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered judgment in the matter of R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264 in which the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Buddin and Johnson JJ agreeing) accepted the correctness of the approach taken by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Australian Crime Commission v OK, again in relation to the operation of the Australian Crime Commission Act. Subsequently, in New South Wales Crime Commission v Hung Sun Choi [2012] NSWSC 658, a matter arising under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, McCallum J, although not adopting the reasoning in Australian Crime Commission v OK, thought the relevant statutory regimes were, now, for all practical purposes indistinguishable and declined to follow the approach of RS Hulme J in the present matter.

23Faced with the disparity in approaches, counsel for the respondents accepted that there should be a grant of leave to appeal. That concession was correct. Accordingly, the Commission should have leave to appeal.

The principle relied on: risk of interference with a criminal trial
24The issue of principle at the heart of the appeal may be shortly stated. Under the general law, the Court will grant an injunction to restrain an inquiry undertaken in the exercise of executive power, if it carries with it a real risk that the conduct of the inquiry will interfere with the administration of justice in criminal proceedings. Such interference would constitute contempt of court and, accordingly, an injunction may lie to prevent a threatened contempt. That principle has been discussed in a number of cases concerning royal commissions: Clough v Leahy [1904] HCA 38; 2 CLR 139 at 161 (Griffith CJ); McGuinness v Attorney-General of Victoria [1940] HCA 6; 63 CLR 73 at 84-85 (Latham CJ) and Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' & Builders Labourers' Federation [1982] HCA 31; 152 CLR 25 at 94-95 (Mason J); 105 (Murphy J); 129 (Wilson J, Aickin J agreeing at 119); 158-159 (Brennan J).

25Subject to any constraints imposed by the Constitution, and in particular Ch III thereof, the general law may be varied by statute. In Lockwood v The Commonwealth [1954] HCA 31; 90 CLR 177 at 185 Fullagar J was not able to envisage circumstances in which ""what is expressly authorized by or under a statute is a contempt, and it is a rule of the common law that the common law itself gives way to statute law"": see also Aickin J in Builders Labourers' Federation at 120. Murphy J, in Builders Labourers' Federation, considered the observations of Fullagar J to be erroneous, on the basis that neither the executive power nor legislation could support conduct which tended to undermine the integrity of the courts exercising Ch III judicial power: at 105. The possibility of a relevant constitutional limitation on legislative power was not raised in the present case and may be put to one side.

26The possibility that an inquiry or investigation, in the course of which a person may be obliged to give incriminating answers, may interfere with the administration of criminal proceedings was articulated in Hammond. That case involved an application for an interlocutory injunction against the conduct of a Royal Commission into the conduct of the plaintiff at a time when charges were pending against him under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The Court granted an injunction to restrain the Commissioner from proceeding further with the examination of Mr Hammond while criminal proceedings against him were pending. However, it is not a case which lends itself to the extraction of principle. As noted by Gibbs CJ, the matter was heard and determined as a matter of urgency, within three days: at 196. The parties approached the proceedings on the basis that the witness had no right to refuse to answer questions on the ground that the answers might incriminate him. All members of the High Court expressed disquiet with that concession, but Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason J agreed) approached the matter on the assumption that the concession was correct: at 198 and 199. Murphy J and Deane J held that the injunction should be granted whether or not he could be required to answer incriminating questions: at 201 and 209. It may be that Brennan J adopted the same approach: at 202-203. Murphy J held that it was inconsistent with the plaintiff's constitutional right to trial by jury for a federal offence that ""he now be subject to interrogation by the executive government or that his trial be prejudiced in any other manner"": at 201. His Honour continued:

""To maintain the integrity of the administration of the judicial power of the Commonwealth an order should issue restraining the Commissioner from directing the plaintiff to answer any question which would tend to incriminate him in respect of the pending criminal proceedings. It appears from the record and statements of counsel that the only questions which the Commissioner desires to put are those which would so tend to incriminate him. In view of his refusal to answer, continuance of the questioning would not serve any purpose of the Commission except to embarrass him.""

27As the questioning was to occur in private, it is unclear whether Murphy J thought that such embarrassment would create a real risk of interference with the criminal trial. The majority declined to restrain the Commissioner from reporting on his inquiries, which were otherwise complete.

28Deane J held at 206:

""Such an extra-curial inquisitorial investigation of the involvement of a person who has been committed for trial in the matters which form the basis of the criminal proceedings against him constitutes, in my view, an improper interference with the due administration of justice in the proceedings against him in the criminal court and contempt of court.""

29Accepting for present purposes that a majority would have restrained the questioning even if the plaintiff were entitled to refuse to answer questions which might incriminate him, those reasons may form the majority approach. More importantly, although it seems likely that both Murphy J and Deane J would have denied the Parliament power to legislate expressly to permit such an investigation to go ahead, that issue was not addressed.

30There is a long history of legal constraints on the common law right not to answer questions which might incriminate one. As noted by Windeyer J in Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49; 114 CLR 63 at 80:

""There is in the common law a traditional objection to compulsory interrogations. Blackstone explained it: 'For at the common law, nemo tenebatur prodere seipsum: and his fault was not to be wrung out of himself, but rather to be discovered by other means, and other men': Comm iv, 296. ... But, strong as has been the influence of this attitude upon the administration of the common law, of the criminal law especially, it must be admitted that in the Chancery Court it had less place: and in bankruptcy jurisdiction it has been largely displaced. For example, a debtor upon his public examination in bankruptcy cannot refuse to answer questions on the ground that the answers may incriminate him ..., the purpose of the bankruptcy statute being to secure a full and complete examination and disclosure of the facts relating to the bankruptcy in the interests of the public. The provisions of The Companies Act reflect, it seems to me, the same idea. The honest conduct of the affairs of companies is a matter of great public concern to-day. If the legislature thinks that in this field the public interest overcomes some of the common law's traditional consideration for the individual, then effect must be given to the statute which embodies this policy.""

31Reference was also made in the course of argument to the decision in Mortimer v Brown [1970] HCA 4; 122 CLR 493, which held that upon an examination of company officers in respect of whom a liquidator had reported that they had concealed material facts and committed acts of fraud in relation to the affairs of the company, questions could be put, the answers to which would tend to incriminate them. Further, in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486 a company officer who had been charged with criminal offences arising out of the collapse of a company of which he was a director sought to restrict his examination, under the Companies (New South Wales) Code (""Companies Code"") then in force, to matters which were not the subject of the pending criminal proceedings. The Code expressly abrogated any right to refuse to answer questions where the answer might tend to incriminate and also provided that where objection had been taken before answering, the answer would not be admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings: s 541(12) set out at 493. The Deputy Registrar before whom the examination was being conducted refused to limit the examination in the way proposed. An application to review that decision was rejected by McLelland J, but an appeal was allowed: Oades v Hamilton (1987) 11 NSWLR 138. As explained by Mason CJ in the High Court, the Court of Appeal had granted relief on the basis that ""because a person charged is not ordinarily required to submit to pre-trial interrogation, to reveal his defences or to produce documents under compulsion, questions asked of that person pursuant to s 541 may lead to the giving of incriminating answers in respect of matters central to the charge which may result in significant prejudice to the person charged and constitute 'a real interference in the administration of criminal justice'"": at 494. As Mason CJ explained, in rejecting that approach:

""It is plain that an examination under s 541 while charges are pending may expose the witness to the risks mentioned. To the extent only that under the section rights of an accused person are denied and protections removed, an examination may even amount to an interference with the administration of criminal justice. But it is well established that Parliament is able to 'interfere' with established common law protections, including the right to refuse to answer questions the answers to which may tend to incriminate the person asked ....""

32Counsel for the respondents sought to distinguish Hamilton v Oades on the basis that three important considerations were treated as significant in the approach adopted to s 541. Thus, at 496, Mason CJ stated:

""First, it expressly abrogates the privilege. Secondly, it specifically provides that answers which may otherwise have been privileged are not admissible in criminal proceedings other than proceedings under the section or other proceedings in respect of the falsity of the answer. Finally, it explicitly empowers the court to give directions concerning the examination. The second and third matters just mentioned are designed to reduce any element of unfairness to the witness that may arise as a result of abrogation of the privilege ....""

33There are two difficulties in accepting this submission. First, as will be discussed below, the points of distinction between the statutory provision relied on in Hamilton v Oades and the Criminal Assets Recovery Act are not significant. Secondly, the significance of the factors set out by Mason CJ should be understood in context. He had (at 495) identified Mortimer v Brown as ""a striking illustration of statutory abrogation of the privilege where the intention to abrogate was ascertained by necessary implication"". The three points referred to above were identified as points of comparison with the relevant provision of the Companies Act 1961 (Qld) which had been held, absent any express abrogation of the privilege, to have had that effect by necessary implication. They were not, as counsel sought to argue before this Court, considerations which were necessarily critical to the conclusion reached in Hamilton v Oades, although they were no doubt important aspects of the exercise in statutory construction of s 541, regardless of the comparative exercise.

34Once it is accepted that the legislature may authorise a scheme of investigation and inquiry which has the potential to diminish common law protections for an accused in criminal proceedings, the question becomes one of statutory construction: does the relevant legislation authorise such conduct and, if so, to what extent? Some assistance may be obtained in answering such questions from answers given in relation to other legislation having similar provisions, purposes or effects; however, the focus of the analysis must be the particular legislation in question, which in this case is the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.

35Before leaving Hamilton v Oades, it is, nevertheless, helpful to note the manner in which the Court dealt with Hammond. In the judgment of the Chief Justice, Hammond was referred to only for the proposition that Parliament may diminish common law protections. In the dissenting judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ, Hammond was cited as authority for the proposition that there must be a clear expression of legislative intent before the privilege against self-incrimination could be abrogated - at 500-501 - a matter not in doubt in that case. Dawson J, in the majority, referred to the central passage in the reasoning of Gibbs CJ in Hammond, noted that it had been preceded by the observation that the urgency had precluded the Court considering the liquidation cases and continued at 509:

""Moreover, the legislation in question in Hammond ... was of a different kind, being concerned in general terms with executive inquiry by means of a Royal Commission or Board of Inquiry without reference to subject matter or purpose.""

36Toohey J also gave limited effect to Hammond, referring to his earlier remarks when on the Federal Court, in Huston v Costigan (1982) 45 ALR 559 at 563: Hamilton v Oades at 515-516. 

Provisions of Criminal Assets Recovery Act
37The background, structure and purpose of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act has been the subject of analysis in a number of judgments of this Court, including New South Wales Crime Commission v Kelaita [2008] NSWCA 284; 75 NSWLR 564 (Allsop P, Giles and Bell JJA agreeing) and, by reference to the later Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), in Lee v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2009] NSWCA 347; 75 NSWLR 581. As Allsop P noted in Kelaita at [51]:

""Each of the Commonwealth and States has an Act comparable to the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. All of the Acts (except that of Tasmania) provide for confiscation in the absence of conviction. All the Acts (except that of Western Australia) follow a broadly similar pattern. All of the Acts (except that of New South Wales) make express provision for adjusting the amount of the equivalent of a proceeds assessment order by reference to the making of a forfeiture or similar order.""

38The important public purpose of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act is identified both in the long title and the statement of objects. The long title is in the following terms:

""An Act to provide for the confiscation of interests in property that are interests of a person engaged in serious crime related activities; to enable proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown; and for other purposes.""

39Section 3 provides:

""3 Principal objects

The principal objects of this Act are:

(a) to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person if the Supreme Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person has engaged in serious crime related activities, and
...

(c) to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to identify and recover property.""

40Part 2 of the Act contains the principal operative provisions by which proceedings are commenced. Thus, s 10A provides for the Commission to apply to the Supreme Court for a restraining order and s 12 provides for the Supreme Court to make various forms of ancillary orders, including an order for the examination of a person on oath. Part 3 provides for the Commission to apply to the Court for an ""assets forfeiture order"": s 22(1). The Commission may also apply to the Court for an order that a person pay an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of an illegal activity, known as a ""proceeds assessment order"" (s 27) or an ""unexplained wealth order"", requiring the person to pay an amount assessed as the value of any unexplained wealth of the person where there is a reasonable suspicion that the person had been engaged in serious crime related activity: s 28A. These last three orders are collectively referred to as ""confiscation orders"": s 4(1). The Act then provides for ancillary orders relating to a confiscation order: 

""31D Additional orders where application made for confiscation order

(1) If an application is made for a confiscation order, the Supreme Court may, on application by the Commission, when the application for the confiscation order is made or at a later time, make any one or more of the following orders:

(a) an order for the examination on oath of:

(i) the affected person, or
(ii) another person,

before the Court, or before an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of court, concerning the affairs of the affected person, including the nature and location of any property in which the affected person has an interest,

....

(2) The Commission must give notice of an application for an order under this section to the affected person.

(3) Sections 13 and 13A apply in respect of a person being examined under an order under this section in the same way as they apply in respect of a person being examined under an order under section 12 (1).""

41Although the Criminal Assets Recovery Act is detailed and far reaching in its scope, reference to these provisions is sufficient to demonstrate how its purposes are to be effected. The application before the primary judge was brought pursuant to s 31D. There was no suggestion that the power was not engaged, nor that the section was not, in its terms, constitutionally valid. Thus, the refusal of the primary judge to make the orders sought against the respondents flowed from what was described as ""the discretion"" not to exercise the power conferred.

42Critical to the operation of the power are two further provisions. First, there are the provisions relating to the privilege against self-incrimination identified in s 31D as applicable in respect of a person being examined pursuant to an order under that section. As originally enacted, self-incrimination was dealt with in s 13,. In 2005 self-incrimination was removed from s 13 and dealt with separately in s 13A which now provides, so far as relevant:

""13A Privilege against self-incrimination

(1) A person being examined under section 12 is not excused from answering any question, or from producing any document or other thing, on the ground that the answer or production might incriminate, or tend to incriminate, the person or make the person liable to forfeiture or penalty.

(2) However, any answer given or document produced by a natural person being examined under section 12 is not admissible in criminal proceedings (except proceedings for an offence under this Act or the regulations) if:

(a) the person objected at the time of answering the question or producing the document on the ground that the answer or document might incriminate the person, or
(b) the person was not advised that the person might object on the ground that the answer or document might incriminate the person.

(3) Further information obtained as a result of an answer being given or the production of a document in an examination under section 12 is not inadmissible in criminal proceedings on the ground:

(a) that the answer had to be given or the document had to be produced, or
(b) that the answer given or document produced might incriminate the person.""

43Three aspects of this provision are significant. First, it expressly removes the operation of the general law principle that a person cannot be compelled to answer a question on the ground that the answer might incriminate or tend to incriminate the person. Secondly, it provides what is commonly described as ""use immunity"" for the answer, so long as objection was taken at the time of answering on the ground of self-incrimination. Thirdly, there is an express rejection of what is commonly described as ""derivative use immunity"". The legislature evidently gave consideration to the consequences of removing the immunity from self-incrimination. There was no attempt to condition the removal of the immunity upon the existence or otherwise of outstanding criminal charges. No doubt that was because the confiscation of assets did not depend on a criminal conviction and, even if charges have not been laid, they might be laid in the future. The possibility, at least, of criminal charges was recognised by the conferral of use immunity in sub-s (2).

44In respect of the third point, what is significant is not merely the rejection of such an immunity, but the fact that it was expressly addressed. The legislature evidently appreciated that answers given under compulsion might ""set in train a process which may lead to incrimination or may lead to the discovery of real evidence of an incriminating character"": Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre [1982] AC 380 at 443 (Lord Wilberforce). The decision not to preclude the use of such information may have followed the reasoning of Mason CJ in Hamilton v Oades at 496:

""Of course [s 541 of the Companies Code] gives no protection to the witness against the use in criminal proceedings of derivative evidence, ie, evidence which is obtained from other sources in consequence of answers given by the witness in his examination. It would be difficult for Parliament to provide for specific protection against derivative use of such answers given by a witness. Immunity from derivative use tends to be ineffective by reason of the problem of proving that other evidence is derivative .... But in any case, by enacting s 541 without providing such specific protection, Parliament has made its legislative judgment that such action is not required and has limited specific protection to the possible consequences of direct use in evidence of the answers of the witness, thereby guarding against the possibility that the witness will convict himself out of his own mouth - the principal matter to which the privilege is directed.""

45In Hamilton v Oades, the legislative regime provided by the Companies Code left open the possibility that a court might adjourn an examination in circumstances where there were outstanding criminal proceedings. The point at which the minority departed from the majority was whether it was open to the Court of Appeal to order an adjournment to avoid a real risk of challenge to the fairness and integrity of the criminal proceeding. The majority held that an adjournment for that purpose should not have been granted. Mason CJ held that although the Court had a range of powers available to it to control the examination, adjournment pending completion of the criminal proceedings was not an order of the kind permitted: at 499. 

46The second additional provision in the Criminal Assets Recovery Act which provides a strong basis for the same conclusion in this case is s 63, which states:

""63 Stay of proceedings

The fact that criminal proceedings have been instituted or have commenced (whether or not under this Act) is not a ground on which the Supreme Court may stay proceedings under this Act that are not criminal proceedings.""

47The respondents submitted that this case did not involve a ""stay"". That was no doubt true, but addressed only one aspect of the legislative purpose. As senior counsel for the Commission remarked, the refusal of orders effected a de facto stay. The statutory purpose revealed by s 63 is not to be ignored because the procedure in a particular case involves an adjournment application, an application to revoke or set aside an order, or the resistance to the making of the order in the first instance, rather than a stay. If the fact of criminal proceedings is ""not a ground"" to stay an examination under s 31D, it should not be an available ground for resisting or delaying examination on any other procedural basis. Further, the purpose is not avoided by arguing that the real ground is the risk of prejudice to a criminal proceeding, rather than the fact that such a proceeding is on foot. The latter should be understood to encompass the former and any variation on it.

48Finally, the respondents contended that the statutory purposes revealed by the Criminal Assets Recovery Act should not be equated with the public interest in an expeditious examination of a company officer pursuant to the statutory scheme under consideration in Hamilton v Oades. While it is true that the public interest in question differs, there is no basis for concluding that the public interest in respect of a company liquidation or an individual bankruptcy, which is primarily directed to the recovery of sufficient assets to repay creditors, is to be weighed against the public purpose of depriving those who benefit from criminal activities of the proceeds of those activities in a way which discounts the latter interest as against the former. 

49The appropriate conclusion is that the statutory purposes revealed by the Criminal Assets Recovery Act were intended to be available and proceedings to give effect to them were intended to be maintained despite the possibility of adverse consequences for criminal proceedings otherwise on foot. 

Procedural safeguards
50One further factor which should be addressed, because relied upon by the respondents in support of the refusal to make examination orders, was the supposed absence of appropriate procedural protections which might prevent an examination becoming an abuse of power. Again, the substance of the argument was presented by way of contrast with the circumstances revealed in Hamilton v Oades.

51Reference was made to the provision in s 541(5) of the Companies Code under consideration in Hamilton v Oades, which permitted the court, either when ordering an examination or at any later time, to give ""such directions as to the matters to be inquired into, and ... as to the procedure to be followed (including, in the case of an examination in private, directions as to the persons who may be present), as it thinks fit"". By reference to that provision, Mason CJ noted that ""if a liquidator were to conduct an examination directed to compel the examinee to disclose defences or to give pre-trial discovery, or to establish guilt, this examination may be restrained as an abuse of process"": at 498. His Honour expanded on the powers available to the Court in such circumstances at 499:

""For example, an examination may need to be held in private, or the publication of names or evidence restricted .... Or it may be that the court in conducting the examination may feel it necessary, in accordance with the statutory purpose, not to permit a particular question to be asked which would prejudice the examinee's fair trial ....""

52While Mason CJ held that it was not appropriate to invoke such powers in advance of the questions being asked, the respondents contended that the Court, in holding an examination under s 31D, did not enjoy powers of the kind which were held to be available in Hamilton v Oades.

53The submission should be rejected for three broad reasons. First, there is no reason to suppose that s 541(5) conferred any greater powers on the court conducting an examination than would otherwise have been available. Secondly, there was no attempt to identify what limitations, if any, distinguished the powers of the court in conducting such an examination, as compared with the usual powers now available under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules and the inherent powers of the Supreme Court to ensure that its processes are not abused. Indeed, there was no attempt to address the scope of the available powers at all.

54Thirdly, reference was made to the fact that the order sought an examination on oath before a registrar of the Court. Again, the assumption appears to have been that the powers of a registrar, whilst exercising the jurisdiction of the Court, were in some way restricted. No such possibility occurred, apparently, to any party or judge involved in Hamilton v Oades, where the examination was held before a Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court. Assuming, as senior counsel for the Commission stated without contradiction, that power has now been conferred on the registrars of the Court to conduct examinations under s 31D, there was no explanation as to why in exercising the ""powers of the Court"", a registrar, who would constitute the Court for that purpose, did not have all the powers referred to in Hamilton v Oades and, no doubt, other powers: see Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), ss 121 and 120A; the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), s 13 and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), Sch 10, Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, item 2.

Reasoning of primary judge
55The reasoning of the primary judge was erroneous in two respects. First, he approached the availability of derivative evidence as increasing the risk of prejudice to a fair trial if an examination were to go ahead, subject only to the availability of a non-publication order under what was then s 62 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act (before the section's repeal and replacement by the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (""the Suppression Orders Act"")) and the fact that s 62 did not go as far as s 25A of the Australian Crime Commission Act. That approach was erroneous. It failed to consider whether the statutory scheme, revealed in part in the combination of s 13A(2) and (3), authorised such conduct, despite the fact that it might impinge on future criminal proceedings. Further, the reasoning failed to distinguish between the different regimes for examination and protection of information, when carried out by an officer of the Commission and by a judicial officer.

56Secondly, having distinguished Australian Crime Commission v OK, his Honour stated that ""the circumstances here are thus governed by the decision in Hammond"": at [20]. For the reasons indicated above, that statement failed to consider the extent to which the Recovery Act permitted a degree of potential interference with a criminal trial and precluded judicial intervention to prevent such interference. In particular, the relevance of s 63 of the Recovery Act was neither identified nor considered.

57The matter having been approached on an erroneous basis, the decision should be set aside.

Authority in other courts
58The respondents contended that, in the event this Court reached the conclusion set out above, it should overrule or decline to follow authorities which supported such a conclusion. That submission did not, of course, extend beyond decisions of single judges or appellate courts below the High Court. Because the conclusion is based on the proper construction of the statute and the application of principles derived from decisions of the High Court, the question of departing from earlier decisions does not arise. Nevertheless, given the nature of the submissions and the criticisms made of earlier decisions, it is appropriate to explain why the reasoning set out above is consistent with earlier authorities.

59The primary focus of the respondents' challenge was directed to the reasoning of the majority (Emmett and Jacobsen JJ) in Australian Crime Commission v OK (above at [21]). In substance, the respondents sought to adopt the reasoning of Spender J in dissent. The dissent, however, was underpinned by the conclusion that the reasoning in Hammond was to be applied and that ""the right to silence at trial exists as a common law right"": at [35]. No reference was made to Hamilton v Oades, nor was there the kind of statutory analysis which might have belied the universality of the statement at [35]. Beyond supporting the reasoning of Spender J, no error was identified in the approach of the majority, which may be accepted as correct, at least with respect to the operation of the Australian Crime Commission Act. 

60A second contention of the respondents was that Emmett and Jacobsen JJ appeared to place significant weight on the fact that the ""examiner"" was required to hold the examination in private and could give directions as to who was to be present (s 25A(3)) and could direct that evidence given in the course of the examination not be published. Based on the view that the safeguards provided by s 25A(9) were available and an appropriate direction could be made, the majority concluded that there was ""no real risk to the fair trial"" of the person being examined: at [113]. By contrast, the respondents submitted that in the present case there was no equivalent to s 25A(9) and, in particular, the requirement that the examiner ""must give"" a direction as to the non-publication of the evidence ""if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence"".

61The respondents compared this provision with the relevant provisions under State law, relating to non-publication, which are now to be found in the Suppression Orders Act. The respondents submitted that there was now a presumption against a suppression order (s 6) and a requirement that the court could only make such an order if it were ""necessary"" to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice: s 8(1)(a). 

62Two points should be made in this regard. First, the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (NSW) s 13(9) confers on the Commission a power to restrict publication in terms relevantly identical to s 25A(9) of the Commonwealth Act. This provision has not been replaced by the Suppression Orders Act (which does not apply to hearings conducted by the Commission), no doubt for the reason that a different and stricter regime of privacy is to be applied by the Commission in exercise of its powers of investigation. By contrast, the proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act are conducted before a judicial officer, be it a judge or registrar, of the Supreme Court. Secondly, the Suppression Orders Act is not intended to preclude the making of appropriate orders in appropriate cases. For example, there is no reason to suppose that the names of informers will not be protected as they have been in the past. If, as the respondents contend, the questions asked and answers given during an examination under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act would, were they to be revealed, prejudice a future criminal trial, there is no reason to suppose that a relevant order will not be made under s 8(1)(a) or (e), or both.

63The more significant lesson for these proceedings is, as noted by McCallum J in Hung Sun Choi (see [22] above), that although the reasoning in Australia Crime Commission v OK should be accepted, the legislative regime is different and the relevant State Act must be analysed in its own terms. The difference between the powers and function of an inquiry before an officer of the executive branch of government and an inquiry before a judicial officer of the Supreme Court has significant weight. 

64It should also be noted that, for the reasons set out above, McCallum J was correct in declining to follow the judgment of the primary judge in the present case: at [35].

65To the extent that Australian Crime Commission v OK did affect the outcome in the present case, the respondents face a formidable and additional hurdle, the reasoning of the majority having been accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v CB (see [22] above) at [108]. This Court would not decline to follow a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in these circumstances, unless persuaded it was clearly wrong. (There are occasions on which the Court of Criminal Appeal has been clearly wrong: the suggestion that its obligation in respect of judgments of this Court was merely to have ""great regard for a carefully considered decision of the Court of Appeal"" was erroneous when stated - see R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 472D-E (Hunt CJ at CL, Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ) - and certainly cannot stand since the decision of the High Court in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89.)

66It is sufficient to note that there is no decision of a court of co-ordinate status in the judicial hierarchy which requires or even supports a contrary conclusion to that reached above.

Re-exercise of discretion
67The parties raised the possibility that if error were found on the part of the primary judge, this Court might consider it appropriate either to exercise the power itself (or decline to do so) or remit the matter for further consideration in the Common Law Division. Accepting that the Court might well adopt the former approach, the respondents filed additional material, mentioned above, on which they relied in order to resist an order under s 31D. As explained below, neither the material tendered on the appeal, nor the circumstances relied upon before the primary judge, have any significant impact on the exercise of the power. Accordingly it is appropriate that this Court exercise the power without further delay.

68The gravamen of the additional material may be briefly stated. The relevant material was, primarily, the transcript of the first day of a District Court trial of the respondents which commenced on 23 November 2010 before Solomon DCJ (but was later aborted). The trial judge raised with the prosecutor a question as to how it was intended that the prosecution would deal with evidence relating to the funding of a company of which one of the respondents was the principal. The problem his Honour identified was ""why the company cash position is relevant to the possession and deem[ed] supply of the drugs"": Tcpt, 23/11/10, p 2 (25). In response, the prosecutor noted that there was little for him to go on as to how the defence would be run, but noted that both accused had been examined by the Commission and from that material the prosecution had gained ""an idea where they might be heading in terms of"" their defence. In the result, the trial judge separated the money laundering offence, which was fixed for a later hearing. 

69The relevant aspect of the transcript was its revelation that records of interviews by the Commission had been made available to the prosecution and, it appears, had then been served on the accused as part of the disclosure obligation of the prosecution. Perhaps unnecessarily, the respondents had then subpoenaed the Commission to produce its records, which was also done. The next step in the argument was that the transcript of the interview between the Commissioner and the respondent Jason Lee included advice to him that the proceedings ""are in secret and they're being recorded on audio-visual equipment"": Tcpt, 26/11/09, p 2. The transcript recorded that the Commissioner gave a direction immediately the respondent was sworn that his evidence ""shall not be published except in such manner and to such persons as the Commission specifies"": Tcpt, p 3. The respondent objected to being required to answer questions, as a result of which the respondent was told by the Commissioner that ""the answers you give cannot be used against you in criminal proceedings"": Tcpt, p 4.

70Reliance was placed on this material apparently for the proposition that, although the respondent had been assured that the proceedings were ""secret"", that his evidence would not be published and could not be used in criminal proceedings, and that a non-publication order applied, he was nevertheless confronted one year later, at his criminal trial, with a copy of his interview, which was used by the prosecution to adjust its evidence on the basis of what the interview appeared to disclose as to his proposed defence. This was said to demonstrate an improper use of the material by the Commission. 

71The additional evidence tendered by the Commission confirmed, in effect, that the Commissioner had, in May 2010, approved release of the examination transcripts for the respondents to the police and, in July 2010, had further approved their dissemination to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was unclear on what basis the respondents asserted that the release of the material was unlawful or improper. On one view, it was the fact of the release rather than its impropriety which may have assisted their case. In other words, the fact that such material might lawfully be released was as relevant as, if not of greater relevance than, the inference that on a particular occasion material had been released without proper authority.

72On the other hand, if the release were lawful, the respondent would need to explain why the conduct of a State investigatory officer, acting within statutory powers, could be taken to involve an unlawful interference with the administration of criminal justice. The correct analysis, as explained above, was that the legislature had weighed competing public interests and had determined that the relevant powers should be conferred and should be available despite the possible consequences for an accused in criminal proceedings not yet completed.

73The respondents faced a further difficulty in relying on this material. As already noted, the statutory regime pursuant to which an officer of the Commission could carry out an investigation and interview a person on oath was not the same as the statutory scheme under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, which involved examination before a judicial officer of the Supreme Court. In particular, the provisions of the Crime Commission Act which prevented a witness refusing to answer questions on the basis that the answers might incriminate him or her were different in form to the provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act: see Crime Commission Act, ss 18(2)(b), 18B(1), (2) and (3)(b); Criminal Assets Recovery Act, s 13A. In particular, the Crime Commission Act did not expressly deal with derivative evidence nor did it contain a provision equivalent to s 63. On the other hand, the Criminal Assets Recovery Act did not have the same provisions in respect of non-disclosure orders and requirements for authorisation for disclosure. Accordingly, evidence as to what happened in respect of interviews conducted by the Commission in the exercise of executive power was of limited value in determining whether an order should be made for examination of the respondents under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.

74In the final analysis, the submissions of the respondents amounted to no more than that they should not be subject to compulsory examination under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act because, in the case of one, his trial on money laundering charges was still outstanding and, with respect to both, there were appeals against conviction in respect of the drug supply charges, which, if successful, might result in a retrial.

75Perhaps by way of a final consideration, which might tip the balance against an order if that were otherwise considered appropriate, the respondents submitted the Commission had not demonstrated that there was relevant property which it had been unable to locate and that, given the lapse of time since the respondents first gave evidence to the Commission (now almost three years) some further delay in their examinations would not undermine the purposes of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act or its operation in these particular circumstances.

76The Commission took issue with each of these grounds for refusing to order an examination of each respondent. With respect to the information sought, it noted that the restraining orders extended to all the property of each respondent, ""including the interest in property ... described in"" the schedules to the orders. That property was extensive, but the Commission did not know whether it was a comprehensive list of the interests in property covered by the order. It was possible that there were interests held in other names and it was that possibility which the Commission was, in the proper exercise of its functions, entitled to explore.

77With respect to delay, the Commission noted that its application for restraining orders and orders for examination under s 12 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act had first been made on 13 May 2010. Those orders had been made ex parte, but Mr Jason Lee had sought to have them set aside. On 10 June 2010, the Commission had filed its notice of motion seeking orders inter partes for examination pursuant to s 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. The following day, the respondents (and another party) had filed a summons seeking leave to appeal against the ex parte orders. The hearing of the motion the subject of these proceedings had occurred on 28 June 2010, approximately six weeks after the first application and within three weeks of the motion for orders under s 31D. A delay of eight months occurred whilst the Court was reserved in respect of its decision. 

78Within a matter of days of the refusal by the primary judge to make the orders in respect of the respondents, the Commission had filed a notice of intention to appeal to this Court. A summons seeking leave to appeal was filed on 30 May 2011. Before that summons was listed for hearing, namely on 21 June 2011, the Commission had sought further orders in the Common Law Division. Six weeks later, on 10 August 2011, that application was dismissed by Garling J as an abuse of process, as noted above. The application for leave to appeal was in fact listed before this Court in December 2011, but the hearing was aborted when it became apparent that there was a challenge to a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court which should properly be dealt with by a bench of five. It followed, the Commission submitted, that there had been no dilatoriness or delay in the steps taken by it, and the lapse of time did not provide a reason why the order it sought and, on its arguments, had been wrongfully denied, should not now be made.

79Thirdly, in relation to the material relied upon before this Court, referable to the first trial of the respondents, the Commission submitted that the circumstances in which the interviews conducted by an officer of the Commission had been disclosed to the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions did not demonstrate any impropriety on the part of the Commission, but were in any event irrelevant to the exercise of the power to grant an examination order under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. 

80The Commission's submissions in each respect should be accepted. Although it was the Commission itself which had conducted the first interviews under its own Act in November and December 2009, there was no suggestion that it was thereafter precluded from seeking to have an officer of the Supreme Court conduct an examination under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. That order having been sought, first ex parte in May 2010 and later inter partes in June 2010, there was no relevant delay at that stage. Arguably the Commission could have acted more expeditiously in seeking leave to appeal, but, in the circumstances which followed that application, it is unlikely that an application for leave to appeal lodged four-six weeks earlier would have achieved a significantly earlier hearing before this Court.

81The possibility that an examination at this stage could interfere with the trial of the respondent Jason Lee, which is apparently listed for hearing in October, and the possible retrial of both in respect of the drug supply charges, is speculative. If a real risk of prejudice is revealed in the course of the conduct of the examination, there is no reason to suppose that the registrar before whom the examinations take place will not have powers available to diminish or prevent that prejudice, to the extent that it is beyond the prejudice authorised by the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.

82In these circumstances, there is no reason not to make the order sought by the Commission.

Conclusions
83The Court should make the following orders:

(1) In addition to the orders made by RS Hulme J in the Common Law Division on 28 February 2011 - 

order that the notice of motion filed by the Commission on 10 June 2010 be otherwise dismissed, such order to take effect from 28 February 2011.

(2) Grant leave to appeal and direct that the appellant file within seven days a notice of appeal in the form of the draft notice contained in the white folder.

(3) Allow the appeal and set aside the additional order identified in (1) above.

(4) Pursuant to s 31D(1)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), order that:

(a) Jason Lee (aka Do Young Lee) be examined on oath before a registrar concerning his own affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest, on a date and at a time to be fixed by the registrar.

(b) Seong Won Lee be examined on oath before a registrar concerning the affairs of Jason Lee (aka Do Young Lee) or Elizabeth Park, including the nature and location of any property in which Jason Lee (aka Do Young Lee) or Elizabeth Park has an interest, on a date and at a time to be fixed by the registrar.

(5) Order that the respondents pay the Commission's costs in this Court.

(6) Grant the respondents certificates under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) in respect of the costs of the appeal.

84MACFARLAN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and with his Honour's reasons, together with those of Beazley and Meagher JJA.

85MEAGHER JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and can state my reasons for doing so fairly shortly.

86The question for the primary judge was whether to exercise the discretion given by s 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 to make orders for the examination on oath of the two respondents, Jason Lee and Seong Won Lee. At the time the primary judge heard the application the respondents were awaiting trial on drug and firearm charges. Each has since been convicted of those charges and has appealed against those convictions. Jason Lee is also awaiting trial on a further charge of money laundering.

87The stated objects of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act include to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person if the Supreme Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person has engaged in serious crime-related activity; to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person that is illegally acquired and held in a false name or is not declared in confiscation proceedings; and to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to identify and recover such property: s 3(a), (b1) and (c).

88Section 31D, like s 12(1)(b), provides for the examination of a person on oath before the Supreme Court, or an officer of the Court, concerning the affairs of that person (either as an ""affected person"" within s 31D(4) or as owner of an interest in property that is the subject of a restraining order), including the nature and location of any property in which the person has an interest. Those sections also provide for the examination of other persons concerning the affairs of that affected person or owner.

89Any examination under s 12(1)(b) or s 31D is subject to s 13A which removes the privilege against self-incrimination and gives an immunity in criminal proceedings from use of answers given or documents produced, but does not give any immunity in respect of the use of further information obtained as a result of answers given or documents produced.

90The primary judge declined to make orders for the examination of the respondents whilst there remained outstanding charges against them, reasoning as follows: NSW Crime Commission v Lee [2011] NSWSC 80 at [16]-[19]. First, referring to Hammond v Commonwealth of Australia [1982] HCA 42; 152 CLR 188, there is a general principle that a person is not obliged to incriminate himself or herself; secondly, given the existence of that principle, an examination in the terms sought would permit questioning in respect of matters relevant to the outstanding charges against the respondents and create a real risk of interference with the administration of justice; and thirdly, that that real risk was not removed in relation to the use of further information obtained as a result of answers given or documents produced (often described as indirect or derivative use) because whilst s 62 of the Act gave the Court power to give a direction limiting publication of answers or documents (and thereby the use to which they could be put), it did not require the Court to make such an order. In relation to this third consideration, the primary judge sought to distinguish the reasoning of Emmett and Jacobson JJ in Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; 185 FCR 258 on the basis that s 25A(9) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) required the examiner to give a non-publication direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the fair trial of a person charged with an offence.

91His Honour's decision not to make those orders involved the exercise of a discretion to which the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 apply.

92In exercising that discretion the primary judge did not give effect to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act which, in their abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination, are similar to those considered by the High Court in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486. His Honour does not appear to have been referred to that decision. 

93The privilege against self-incrimination protects against the consequences of indirect or derivative use of information given or documents produced as well as against direct use: Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre [1982] AC 380 at 443; Sorby v The Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281 at 293-294; Hamilton v Oades at 493-494, 503. That privilege can be abrogated by clear legislative intention: Hammond at 197-198, 200; Sorby at 289-290, 294-295, 309, 311; Hamilton v Oades at 495, 500-501, 509. 

94Where the Parliament, in furtherance of a particular public interest, has abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination, effect must be given to the statutory provisions which do so: Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49; 114 CLR 63 at 80; Mortimer v Brown [1970] HCA 4; 122 CLR 493 at 495, 499; Hamilton v Oades at 494-495, 507. Such provisions, as is the case with companies legislation enabling the examination of directors, may expressly authorise the obtaining by compulsory examination of evidence and information to support the bringing of criminal charges: Mortimer v Brown at 496, 499; Hamilton v Oades at 496.

95In Hammond, on which the primary judge relied, the High Court dealt with the urgent injunction application on the basis that whilst there may have been a limited abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination by the relevant legislation, the issue remained whether there was a real risk that the administration of justice could be interfered with because of the possible indirect use of information obtained: Hammond at 196, 198, 199, 202, 207. There was no consideration of cases such as Rees v Kratzmann or Mortimer v Brown and whether the legislation authorised or sanctioned the relevant conduct notwithstanding that it involved such a risk. 

96Section 13A expressly abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination. It provides specific protection against direct use of answers given or documents produced by providing that they are not admissible in criminal proceedings. It also provides for the examination to take place before the Court, or an officer of the Court, which is a safeguard against the examination being conducted for an improper purpose or in a way which constitutes an abuse of process: Mortimer v Brown at 499; Hamilton v Oades at 498. At all times relevant to the decision of the primary judge, s 62 (which was repealed with effect from 1 July 2011) gave the Court power to make ""such orders as it thinks fit with respect to the publication"" of any matter arising under the Act. That power was in addition to the Court's inherent power to ensure the proper administration of justice which could be exercised by requiring that the examination be held in private and/or that the publication of names or evidence be restricted: Hamilton v Oades at 498-499, 502, 516.

97The power given by s 31D is in aid of an application for a confiscation order which includes an asset forfeiture order. To obtain such a forfeiture order it is necessary that there is a finding of the Supreme Court on the balance of probabilities either that the person whose assets are the subject of the proposed order has engaged in serious crime-related activity (s 22(2)); or that the property or its acquisition was as a result of serious crime-related activity (s 22(2A)). The legislation contemplates, as its objects make clear, that examinations in aid of the making of such orders will take place in circumstances which include that the person being examined has been charged with a serious criminal offence (as defined in s 6) and that proceedings on that charge have been commenced but not completed. 

98That this is so, is confirmed by s 63 which provides that the fact that criminal proceedings have been instituted or commenced is not a ground on which the Court may stay proceedings under the Act that are not criminal proceedings. As Basten JA observes, the statutory purpose revealed by that section is not to be ignored because the procedure in a particular case involves an application to set aside an order or to adjourn an examination or to resist the making of an order for an examination. 

99The position under the Act is in many respects similar to the legislative regime considered in Hamilton v Oades. Section 13A gives no specific protection to the examinee against the use in criminal proceedings of further information obtained as a result of answers given or documents produced. However, by not providing specific protection against that use (and by providing expressly that such information is ""not inadmissible""), the Parliament has made its legislative judgment that specific protection against the risk of that use is not required. The protection to the examinee against any such derivative use is provided by requiring that the examination take place before the Supreme Court, or an officer of the Court, having in addition to the express power given by s 62, the inherent power to ensure the proper administration of justice. The orders which the Court, or any officer of the Court, could make are (with the repeal of s 62 and its replacement by the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010), a suppression or non-publication order under s 7 of that Act, on the grounds in s 8(1)(a) or (e), or an order restricting the publication of evidence in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction; which is not affected by that Act: s 4.

100There was not identified by the primary judge or in argument before this Court any fact or circumstance justifying the decision of the primary judge to decline making the orders for examination in circumstances where there were outstanding charges other than that there was a risk that answers given in the examination might be the source of information used in some way in relation to the subsequent trials. The existence of that risk was an insufficient basis for declining to make the order sought. 

101The exercise of the discretion arises in a context where the Act provides for an examination to take place notwithstanding that there remain risks of adverse consequences in relation to criminal proceedings which have been commenced but not completed. In such circumstances, the Act gives protection to the examinee in the form of the Court's power to control and supervise the examination. The discretion to order an examination should not be exercised on the basis that the Court, or officer of the Court before whom the examination takes place, may in the conduct of the examination decline to make a non-publication order in respect of specific questions or subject matter. To do so would disregard the legislative intent that any such risks be addressed in that way: Hamilton v Oades at 496. In not approaching the matter on this basis the primary judge erred.

102None of this analysis is inconsistent with the reasoning of the majority in Australian Crime Commission v OK which was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264 esp at [110]; or the correctness of the decision of McCallum J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Hung Sun Choi [2012] NSWSC 658.

103It is appropriate that this Court exercise the power under s 31D afresh rather than remit the matter to the Common Law Division. For the reasons given by Basten JA I agree that the discretion should be exercised by making the order sought by the Commission.

		12 December 2013",2012-09-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2760025,R v Edmund Cyril RAS [2012] NSWDC 214,"SENTENCE

1Edmund Cyril Ras appears for sentence following his conviction on 7 March 2012 after a trial before a jury on the following count: 
""On 31 December 2010, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity being imported a marketable quantity."" 

2The charge is brought pursuant to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1991 (Cth). The maximum penalty for that offence is twenty-five years imprisonment, five thousand penalty units or $550,000 or both. 

3The sentencing proceedings are taking place today following two adjournments. To explain the delay, there was initially an adjournment on the offender's application on 8 June 2012, when a letter was faxed by the Department of Corrective Services from Prince of Wales Hospital, indicating the offender was unable to come to court. That was because of a total right knee replacement. No notice of this operation was given either to the Court or apparently the offender's counsel. The operation was apparently the result of ongoing trauma for some time. It did not result from his incarceration. It was carried out at no cost to the offender. As I understand it his prognosis is good and his health needs can be managed within the prison system or the Justice Health system.

4Given the offender's operation and the availability of the parties, the date was then fixed for 24 August 2012, but vacated on the application of the Crown, that application not being opposed by the offender's legal representatives. 

5In terms of factual background, the offender Mr Ras entered Australia at approximately 2pm on 31 December 2010, at the Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. He handed his incoming passenger card, referred to as the IPC, to a Customs officer and was then directed to an area where he presented a single black Travelite brand bag. At that time, he told the Customs officer that he had packed the bag himself and was aware of the contents of it. The Customs officer conducted a baggage inspection, in which he emptied the suitcase. He noted the bag felt heavier than a normal suitcase of that size.

6Another Customs officer, Ms Holtz, examined the bag, noted its weight and then took the bag for an x-ray. At that time the Customs officer told Mr Ras that she had x-rayed the bag. He then confirmed it was his bag and he had bought it new from a Chinese shop. The Customs officers were clearly suspicious of answers given by Mr Ras, not the least of the causes for their suspicions were the weight of the bag and the answers given by the offender.

7The bag was subject to a series of IONSCAN inspections and was also x-rayed. Photographs of the bag were tendered during the trial, which showed that the bag had an internal section behind a zipped, lined area. Secreted in that section was a flat parcel of cocaine admixture weighing 792 grams. The packet contained 718.5 grams of what is regarded for these purposes as pure cocaine. However, its percentage purity was 71.8 percent. The contents of the package had a wholesale value of between $189,000 and $225,000. That was set out in the evidence of Federal Agent Lavetta at transcript p 165.

8Mr Ras was then cautioned and interviewed by the Australian Federal Police. A series of conversations took place in which he indicated, amongst other things, that there was not supposed to be anything in it, but that someone else, namely, a Nigerian man, had given him the bag. Someone was going to take the bag from him at a Sydney hotel and give him another bigger bag with a ticket for ongoing travel to Peru. It was intended, and he knew, that he would be bringing drugs in from Peru to Australia. He said at that stage, ""I was going to look at it, if it was drugs I was going to throw it away."" 

9Mr Ras gave evidence during the trial, in which he said that immediately prior to coming to Australia he had been on a car convoy trip to Pretoria via Johannesburg. During the trip he had been contacted by a Nigerian man called John. He thought he was originally going to Africa at the behest of the Nigerian men. On his account they, or at least John, met him at a Forumla 1 hotel in the suburbs of Johannesburg, and exchanged his damaged shoulder bag for another bag - the bag which he ultimately brought into Australia, which contained the cocaine. He removed his clothes from the shoulder bag and packed them into the bag.

10He was then taken to Tambo International Airport in a taxi with the man called John, who gave him a folder of documents. That included a ticket to Australia for his travel that same day. Indeed on his account, within two hours of him being taken to the airport. That evidence was presumably part of his case that there was little premeditation or planning on his part. If that is the case, it was difficult to accept that he was prepared to travel halfway around the world on essentially one day's notice. He was interviewed by officials from the South African Embassy in accordance with arrangements made through the AFP. He did not tell them of his involvement with the South African Police as he said he did not trust them. His account was also that they would not know of, nor be able to verify, his involvement because he was an unregistered informant. 

11Evidence was given at the trial by Federal Agent Daniel Lavetta (transcript p 172, line 30) to the effect that the AFP intelligence had linked Dominic de Santos, Cyrildine Travel, and a travel agent number to a Nigerian syndicate run out of South Africa. To that extent the offender's account has some connection with reality. 

12Consistent with the jury's verdict, I find that the offender knew when he came into Australia that he was in possession of drugs. I find there was also considerable planning involved in the operation and that involved the offender. I do not accept the offender's account of his undercover or other involvement with the South African Police. No evidence was adduced by him or on his behalf either at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings. There had been a period of eighteen months during which that evidence could have been produced by Mr Ras, or those acting on his behalf, if it was available.

13In terms of evidence given on the sentencing proceedings, a pre-sentence report dated 4 May 2012 was tendered. That forms part of exhibit 1, the Crown papers. Mr Ras is a South African national aged forty-nine. His parents separated when he was three. He was placed in a group home then in a foster care arrangement from the age of six to twelve, when he was returned to his mother's care. One of his step-brothers was murdered in 1993 and another brother died in February this year. That has been a matter that has caused him some distress, particularly as it occurred whilst he was in custody. 

14Mr Ras completed the equivalent of the School Certificate. He has had a variety of employment, including work as a panel beater, spray painter, fibreglasser, plumber and farm manager. On one view, he is a very versatile individual. At the time of coming to Australia he claims to have been driving vehicles for a second-hand car company part time. He indicated to the report writer that he had had financial problems and was supplementing his income with work as a security guard for the company.

15He was married in 2001 and divorced in 2004. He has no children. The report notes a history of suicidal thoughts following the breakdown of his marriage. I note that the 2004 interruption of his marriage coincided with the experience he had in Switzerland, to which I will refer later. Mr Ras has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, having taken cannabis from the age of thirteen, graduating to smoking crack and taking cocaine. The report notes that Mr Ras disclosed being convicted of the importation of cocaine into Switzerland in 2004, for which he spent time in custody. 

16Two faxed letters dated 19 September and 13 October 2001 were tendered from the Federal Criminal Police in Switzerland. Those reports dated 19 September and 13 October 2011 indicate that he was apprehended in March 2004 at the Zurich Airport, with 1,988 grams of cocaine, attached to the lower legs. There were a total of six packages altogether. He appears to have been imprisoned for exactly two years and then expelled to South Africa. 

17The Justice Health report contains a detailed outline of his situation to which I have referred. That has become exhibit S6. It indicates his prognosis is good and his treatment able to be carried out within Justice Health in the correctional setting.

18The prior convictions to which I referred earlier from South Africa are on top of what appears to be an unfortunately extensive criminal history while he was in South Africa. That does seem to have involved matters of theft and fraud, for both of which he received relatively minimal periods of imprisonment, but also a lengthy sentence following a conviction for rape. There is some strength to the defence counsel's submission that I cannot take that into account as the precise details are not known to me, and sentencing regimes differ from country to country.

19In terms of principles from the relevant authorities, both counsel have provided a summary of similar sentences. The Crown's summary of authorities is exhibit S7 and the defence summary is exhibit S9, many of which I am familiar with. They do refer to relatively comparable drug importation matters, involving similar amounts under the same section but the vast majority of those proceeded by way of pleas of guilty, which is not the case here. 

20There were frequently extenuating factors in those cases which are not present here as well. I indicate for the purpose of these proceedings that I have considered the authorities of R v Crouch (District Court of NSW, 19 August 2011, unreported), R v Strode (District Court of NSW, 6 May 2011, unreported), R v Vargas [2011] NSWDC 89, R v Haule (District Court of NSW, 22 October 2010). All of those comparable authorities involve offenders with different personal circumstances and history. There are a variety of different weights of drugs involved, and as I say many were preceded by pleas of guilty.

21Here, on the basis of those authorities, the Crown submits that the fact that the offender has performed a relatively menial or limited role, such as the role of a courier, does not entitle him to any degree of leniency. He cites as the authority R v Muanchugingkan (1990) 52 A Crim R 354 at 356. It seems the facts here come very much within the description of the offender as a courier, as defined by McLellan CJ at common law in DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at 256:
""A ""mere"" or ""bare"" courier may be recruited to bring in border controlled drugs on the promise of a modest reward, commonly although not invariably a monetary sum. A mere courier, although being the importer and critical to the importation, is incidental to the entire enterprise and acts at the instigation and direction of others. He or she will normally have had his or her travel plans, including flights and accommodation, arranged or at least funded by superiors. The mere courier will have had little, if any, input into the travel plans and no input into the planning of the offence""

22Mr Ras, on the evidence, is to be sentenced by me as a courier, not a principal, nor indeed as having any greater role than that of a courier. He was said to be paid about 20,000 Rand. There is some difference about the precise conversion rate but it seems to be of the order of AUD$2,500. It is also clear from De La Rosa and other authorities that couriers and intermediaries do not receive any particular leniency, because without them the narcotics trade would cease. True it is, as Ms Carroll has submitted, that they take the greatest risk; however, they are an essential and integral part of the supply chain. The consequential need for general deterrence must be reflected in the sentence.

23The authorities also make it clear that there needs to be a sentence which reflects society's abhorrence of the trafficking of drugs of this nature. Further, a sentence should be imposed sufficient to deter the offender himself from further offending in this way, in the light of what appears to be a history of a similar offence in 2004. The seriousness with which the legislature has regarded this offence is reflected in the maximum penalty to which I have had regard. 

24Justice McLellan in DPP v De La Rosa to which I have referred held at para 221 that:
""The head sentences in this group range from six to nine years. The non parole periods range from three years to just over five years. The quantity of drug does not appear to be of particular significance. The significant factors which are common are the role played by the offender, the anticipated reward, the nature and timing of any plea as well as the level of any assistance provided. The majority of the offenders in this group were mere couriers.""

25Here, the amount and value of the drugs was substantial. It was about 300 times the limit of the marketable quantity threshold, and was seventy-one per cent pure. 

26The offender is a mature man. He is not impressionable or a young person. He has had a variety of life experiences with a prior criminal record involving incarceration in one of South Africa's toughest gaols. He must have known what penalty awaited him, given his experience in Switzerland. He gave evidence at the trial and he is and was knowledgeable about the ways of the law enforcement and police intelligence community on his account. He described working as a police informant, and with police in undercover activities, see transcript pp 239 and following, although his actual involvement does not appear to have been on the side of any recognised governmental agencies.

27Absent any evidence in this regard, and it is clear that the South African authorities were notified about these proceedings, it does seem to me that this is matter where his denials up to the time of the trial, if not a concoction, were otherwise delusional or deliberate. 

28In my view he was at the level of, and fulfilled the role of, a courier. I do not regard the evidence as enabling any greater role to be found, although on his account he had knowledge of a wider scheme. What was involved was a premeditated planned attempt to import a significant quantity of cocaine of considerable value into Australia. 

29He was clearly involved with others. The drugs were concealed in a relatively sophisticated manner - as I have said, the Swiss authorities noted the secretion and hiding of the cocaine that he imported into Switzerland by way of packets being attached to his lower legs. This practice obviously continued, although he extended it to the bag which he brought into the country.

30Given the offender's age and his apparent life experience, it defies belief that he did not have more that a suspicion, or more than the suspicion he said he came to develop late in the piece as a result of the change of plans and the documentation he was given. It is unclear, even on his account, why he was going to travel to the other side of the world, across at least two continents, to make his mind up about the illegality of a course of pre-arranged conduct, about which he said he had clear suspicions. The jury clearly rejected this evidence, and so do I.

31I do not regard there as being any relative assistance to any police authorities. As I say, the South African authorities were certainly contacted prior to the trial. I would have had considerable doubts, absent evidence to the contrary, about his association with the South African agencies of any shape or form, given his prior record and the matters for which he had already been convicted. He has maintained his innocence and is not eligible for any reduction in his sentence or other discount. While on the law as it currently stands the offender cannot be subject to any harsher penalties for his failure to cooperate or to provide assistance to the authorities, it does become relevant to my assessment of the likely prospects of rehabilitation.

32He has remained steadfast in his denials of guilt, and that is confirmed in the most recent pre- sentence report. There is no evidence that I am prepared to accept on which a finding of prospects of rehabilitation can or should be based.

33I then turn to consider the matters referred to in the authorities, particularly De La Rosa, specifically the role played by the offender; the anticipated reward; the nature and timing of the plea; as well as the absence of any assistance provided. The street value of the drugs involved was substantial on any view. His motivation was purely financial in circumstances where he was well aware, in my view, of the illegality of the operation in which he was involved. He was to receive a cash payment. 

34There was no plea, no acknowledgement of guilt and there has been no assistance - just the reverse. The account that he gave was a story which took some time and effort on behalf of the AFP and presumably the South African authorities to investigate and assess. 

35As I say, that needs to be set against the background that the offender has the prior conviction in Switzerland for a similar matter a relatively short time ago. He was attempting to import into this country a pernicious drug in an amount and at a purity level which would have done this community considerable harm. 

36What is in his favour was that the defence at trial was conducted with appropriate concessions and expedition. That is going to be taken into account by me in the offender's favour, as well as the fact that during his police interviews he was cooperative with the police. I have taken into account the matters referred to in s 16A(2) and (3) of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth. In my view, the sentence I propose to impose is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances as required by s 16A. I take into account the statistics of sentencing matters as published by the Judicial Commission, as an indication, or as a method, of checking that the sentence that I am proposing to impose is within the bounds of the permissible range in the exercise of my discretion.

37I have considered the nature and severity of the conditions which will be relevant to the offender as a foreign national with few relatives in Australia. I was informed that he is not being visited by members of his family; further that his brother to whom he was quite close has died whilst he has been in custody. He was unable to attend his brother's funeral and my assessment is that that has upset him. English is his first language, however he has been in gaol before on a number of occasions in a number of cities. There is no evidence that he will experience any additional hardship in the Australian custodial environment. Indeed, he has already been provided, free of charge to him, an operation for a total knee replacement.

38It is likely that the offender will be deported at the end of the nonparole period of imprisonment. Despite that fact he is entitled to be sentenced as if he was to be subject to supervision in this country. There is no evidence before me that the criteria described in s 16A(2)(b), (c), (d), (e), (fa), (g) and 2A of the Crimes Act are relevant to the current circumstances. 

39In terms of the remainder of the matters specified, I note as follows. In terms of the nature and circumstances of the offence, as I say, it was 618.5 grams of cocaine with a seventy-one percent purity level. In terms of paragraph 16A(2)(f), the offender has not accepted the jury's verdict. He continues to maintain his innocence. He does not have the benefit of any expression of remorse or contrition, nor is any discount appropriate for a plea as was referred to in many of the authorities to which I have been taken. 

40Paragraph 16A(2)(j): here the offender has a previous conviction and incarceration in Switzerland in 2004, for a remarkably similar offence. That is on top of his already extensive prior criminal history in South Africa. He is not in my view, as I have said, entitled to leniency. His antecedents are set out in exhibit S3 in terms of his character, antecedents, age and means. He is a middle aged man, not a young, susceptible individual. 

41He has a character consistent with the findings I have made. He is a person with some health issues, having had the operation that he has, but in my view there are some areas of concern given his apparently delusional belief that he can come to Australia and manufacture a story as he did in this particular instance.

42In terms of rehabilitation I have given this matter considerable thought pursuant to 16A(2)(n). There is no evidence on which I would be prepared to make a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation. He has not worked in custody although that may well be because of his knee operation, and I take that view favourably to him. In my view the sentence should commence on the date the offender was taken into custody; namely, 31 December 2010.

43The offender is convicted. The offender is sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of eight years and three months commencing 31 December 2010 and expiring on 30 March 2019, consisting of a non-parole period of five years and six months imprisonment commencing 31 December 2010 and expiring on 30 June 2016. An additional period of two years and nine months commencing on 1 July 2016 and expiring on 31 March 2019. 

44In turn, that reflects the ratio of 66.67 per cent between the head sentence and a minimum term which I regard as appropriate, having regard to all the factors I have listed.

2760026,R v Roland [2012] NSWDC 200,"SENTENCE



1HIS HONOUR: A concert was held on 1 January this year. It was the type of concert where young people attend. The type of concert where drugs, in particular ecstasy, are often consumed by concert goers. Not surprisingly, police are aware of that circumstance. They were patrolling the entrance to the Field Day Music Festival on New Year's Day this year when they saw the offender, Bradley Roland, coming towards them.

2Mr Roland stands out in the crowd. He is six foot seven, and weighs, he says, 130 kilos. He was also making his appearance obvious by pushing past a number of people. Police watched as he stopped and picked up a packet of cigarettes, conducted a U-turn, and headed away from them. Police decided to speak to Mr Roland. 

3It soon became obvious that he was under the influence of a prohibited drug. His pupils were constricted, and he had a small amount of white substance in the corner of his mouth. 

4Police told the accused he was going to be searched. They took hold of the cigarette packet they had just seen Mr Roland pick up from the ground. They looked in it and they found twenty-three tablets which proved to be ecstasy. The offender was arrested.

5They also found a black Nokia mobile phone on him. They looked at the text messages. They found text messages clearly relating to the offender's supply of ecstasy tablets.

6He was charged with supplying a prohibited drug and was granted bail. He spent no time in custody. He pleaded guilty to that charge at the earliest opportunity, so the sentence I impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been.

7Although not in the facts it has been agreed by the Crown and Mr Dailly, who appears for Mr Roland, that the text messages commenced on 20 December and were from three different mobile telephones. 

8The offender says that some of the drugs in his possession on his arrest were for his own use. He says that because of his size he needs to have more drugs than a smaller person to get the same effect, but he acknowledges that he intended to supply at least some of the drugs in his possession on arrest to friends and associates. He acknowledged of course also that the text messages relate to earlier acts of supply by him.

9So for a period commencing around late December and ending on 1 January the offender would supply ecstasy to his friends, and associates, he says, about six of them. He says that this was because he had developed a drug habit, and one way of funding that was to become involved in drug supply.

10The immediate question which arises is whether the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree. If he was, then a full time custodial sentence is required unless there are exceptional circumstances. There are no exceptional circumstances so if the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree it would necessarily be the case that I would send him to prison, but I am not satisfied that he was trafficking to a substantial degree. Although there were supplies on earlier occasions it is clear that they were for relatively small amounts, a relatively small number of people, over a relatively short period of time. Were any one of those three factors not present the outcome for Mr Roland would definitely be a full time custodial sentence.

11Of course the finding that I have just made does not mean that he should not go to gaol anyway. Whether he does or not depends on other matters which I will now mention.

12The offender was brought up in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. His parents separated for a time, but are now back together. They have a Polish background. The offender's father has struggled with mental illness for a number of years, and his mother has struggled with fitting into Australian society and is unhappy as a result.

13The offender had a lot of opportunities which were denied other members of society. His grandparents were able to fund his attendance at various private schools. I say various private schools because a feature of the offender's upbringing is that his misbehaviour led to him moving from school to school, sometimes involuntarily when he was asked to leave. 

14He was, at least partly because of his size, successful in sport, and he had an ambition to play college basketball in the United States of America.

15He wanted a scholarship but did not get one even though another Australian basketballer of his age, whom the offender considers was an inferior player, managed to get such a scholarship. It is fair to say that the offender has been affected by his failure to get such a scholarship. 

16He told me that it was out of character for him to be involved in drugs. The offender probably believes that, but the objective evidence would suggest what he says is simply not the case. There have been many periods in his life when he has been a user of drugs and if we include alcohol there have been even more. 

17He is described by others, not in these terms but in words I will use, as a fitness freak and so the offender probably believes that drug use is out of character because he looks after himself and his health. But he has a conviction in New South Wales for drug possession. He was found guilty of an offence in Queensland for drug possession, although it did not result in a conviction and he has told others there have been times in his life where he has used drugs, including alcohol as well. 

18The offender is the sort of person who, absent assistance, will probably relapse into drug use regularly throughout his life. There is of course the associated risk, as was present in this case, that if he starts using drugs, he will start dealing them as well. 

19The evidence would suggest the accuracy of what the offender said, that he was only selling drugs in order to fund his own drug use. There is no evidence of a lavish lifestyle. Indeed, the mobile telephone used by the offender seems to have been a rather cheap one. 

20The most important subjective feature regarding the offender concerns an aspect of the psychologist's report. It is obvious that the depression has been a constant feature of the offender's life for many years. Sources of that illness are probably varied, including his father's mental illness, his physical size, making him stand out from the crowd, problems caused by his behaviour as a student and failure to achieve what he had hoped to achieve. Whatever the causes of the offender's depression, it seems undeniable that he has suffered from depression for many years. In those circumstances the offender's resort to drug use can be seen as a way of elevating his mood. The offender's decision to supply drugs has to be looked at in light of that circumstance. 

21Mr Dailly, who appears for the offender, concedes that imprisonment is required. The issues for determination by me therefore are the length of the sentence and, if the sentence is low enough, should that sentence be served other than in full-time custody. Mr Dailly's primary submission is that I should suspend the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed upon his client. It is part of that submission, unstated but nevertheless obvious, that the sentence of imprisonment should be less than two years. Whilst I agree with Mr Dailly that the sentence should be one of two years or less, I cannot accept his submission that the sentence of imprisonment should thus be suspended. 

22It is clear that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation can only be described as guarded. It is clear that there needs to be a significant component of personal deterrence. I do not believe that a suspended sentence of imprisonment adequately achieves the aim of personally deterring the offender from future conduct of this kind. He needs to be punished for what he has done and a suspended sentence would also be inadequate punishment in these circumstances.

23Other alternatives to full-time imprisonment present themselves. I am satisfied in this case that should the offender be suitable for an intensive corrections order that would be an appropriate sentence to impose upon him. An intensive corrections order achieves both punishment by constraining the offender's freedom for a significant period of time and also rehabilitation through requiring him to be supervised and counselled as appropriate. His rehabilitation was also promoted by the need for regular urinalysis which will take place pursuant to an intensive corrections order. Of course he first has to be assessed as being suitable before I can impose such a sentence.

24The order I make is this, the offender's bail is continued until 10 o'clock on 2 November. I will also dismiss the s 166 certificate matter and make the orders, realting to the confiscation of the mobile telephone.

25And I will refer Mr Roland for assessment as to his suitability to serve his sentence by way of an intensive corrections order.

26I will order that the drugs are to be destroyed.

2760052,Cross v R [2012] NSWCCA 114,"Judgment

1ALLSOP P: I agree with Davies J.

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Davies J.

3DAVIES J: On 22 September 2009 the Applicant pleaded guilty at the Downing Centre Local Court to the following offence:

Count 1: At Brighton in about 2004 he did commit an aggravated indecent assault against a child under the age of 10 years, the aggravation being that he was in a position of authority over the child. The maximum penalty for this offence was 10 years imprisonment and it carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years.

He asked that an offence of using a child under the age of 14 for the purpose of making a pornographic video be taken into account on a Form 1. The maximum penalty for that offence was 7 years imprisonment.

4On 10 June 2010 the Applicant pleaded guilty to two further charges as follows:

Count 2: In February 2010 use a carriage service to transmit child pornography. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. 

The Applicant asked for a further offence of using a carriage service to transmit child pornography to be taken into account on a Form 16BA.

Count 3: In March 2010 possess child pornography. The maximum penalty for this offence was 10 years imprisonment.

5The Applicant was sentenced by Judge G D Woods QC in the District Court on 14 December 2010 as follows:

Count 1, and taking into account the offence on the Form 1 - a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years to commence 9 March 2010 and expire 8 March 2013.

Count 2, and taking into account the offence on the Form 16BA - imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years to commence on 9 March 2011 and expire on 8 March 2014.

Count 3 - a non-parole period of 3 months to commence 9 March 2014 and expire 8 June 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months to expire on 8 March 2017.

6Total overall sentence was a period of 7 years to commence on 9 March 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months to expire on 8 June 2014. 

7The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:

(1)His Honour erred in imposing a fixed term with regard to Count 1.

(2)In relation to Count 2 the Sentencing Judge erred by misdirecting himself as to the correct maximum penalty for the offence and so fell into error in arriving at an appropriate sentence for the offence.

(3)The overall sentence is manifestly excessive, given:

(a)The length of the fixed term on Count 2; and

(b)His Honour's decision to entirely accumulate the sentence imposed for Count 3.

Facts

8The following summary of the facts is largely taken from the Remarks on Sentence of Wood QC DCJ. 

9On 29 January 2009 a member of the AFP executed a search warrant at 5 Nebo Place, Cartwright where the Applicant resided. An item discovered during the execution of the search warrant was a video on a DVD of approximately 17 minutes in duration. 

10The background to the video is that the Applicant operated an organisation called 'Pirates School of Sport' at which he ran sporting clinics for children at a Sydney public school between 1999 and 2004. The children paid a fee to attend clinics for activities such as gymnastics, dancing and soccer on Friday afternoons and some Saturday mornings during school term. The clinics were operated in buildings located at Brighton-le-Sands Public School. 

11The video displayed a child of approximately eight years of age who was one of the children that attended the group organised by the Applicant. It showed the boy naked washing himself in the premises in the sink. He was unaware that the recording was taking place. The Applicant is heard on the audio of the film to ask the boy if he wants help washing himself. 

12The Applicant repeatedly suggests that he washes the boys back, arms and bottom. The Applicant then assists the boy to do that and also assists him in washing his penis. After the Applicant rinsed the boy, the Applicant dried him with a towel and, in particular, dried his penis some three or four times. Subsequently, the video cuts to the boy in a leotard, and he is performing various gymnastic activities during which the Applicant zooms and focuses the camera on the boy's crotch and bottom at all times. This event formed the basis for Count 1.

13In relation to Count 2 and the offence on the Form 16BA (""the Commonwealth offences"") the Applicant was engaged on the internet with a username of 'Mouse14' by an undercover AFP agent who had assumed an online identity as 'The Hunter'. During an online conversation on 9 February 2010 the Applicant, as Mouse14, stated that he was attracted to boys between 6 and 15 years, that he looked around various places but was cautious, that he was single and lived with his father and indicated that he was interested in meeting the 13 year old son of The Hunter. 

14The Applicant then disclosed his fantasies about what he might do to the son of The Hunter. The Sentencing Judge described the fantasy as being very blunt and indicating a sexual interest in direct contact with the young child. Having read what is contained in the report of the Federal Agent his Honour's characterisation is correct. 

15In a subsequent online conversation on 12 February 2010 the Applicant said that he was thinking about travelling to Canberra to meet The Hunter and his son in person. He asked The Hunter for his son's MSN username so that he could chat with him, and he said that he had been chatting with a number of 13 year old boys on a certain site, all of whom indicated that they had intercourse with friends and men.

16During the course of that conversation the Applicant sent the undercover officer a video file 4 minutes and 39 seconds long. It depicted a male child approximately 10 years of age masturbating in front of what appears to be a webcam. It appears that it was the events of 12 February 2010 that formed the basis for Count 2 and the events of 9 February 2010 that constituted the offence on the Form 16BA. 

17Subsequent to that conversation the Police identified the Applicant and his address. A further search warrant was executed at the Applicant's premises on 9 March 2010. The Applicant agreed that he was Mouse14 but he downplayed and mitigated his role, suggesting that it was just a conversation, just a fantasy story and he never meant to do anything about it. 

18In the course of the search a number of other things were located including a laptop secreted between the mattress and base of the bed in the bedroom used by the Applicant. When investigations were made into the laptop a total of 2,153 images and 190 videos were deemed to be child pornography. 552 of the images were rated according to the Oliver scale. That is a scale which has been established as a result of a decision in the United Kingdom dealing with similar offences there. It sets out a level of 1 to 5 indicating the degree of seriousness of the kind of child pornography involved with level 1 being merely posing with no sexual activity and level 5 being the worst. On the laptop there were 79 images depicting penetrative sexual activity between children and children and adults (level 4) and 12 images depicting sadism or bestiality (level 5). 

19Other things found in the search contained 1601 images and 190 videos of child pornography material. 195 images and 88 videos were rated at level 4 on the scale. 2 images and 4 videos were rated at level 5. These matters formed the basis of the charge in Count 3.

Subjective Factors

20The Sentencing Judge had a considerable amount of material before him not only from the Probation and Parole Service but also from a number of psychologists. His Honour also heard oral evidence from the Applicant, from one of his sisters, and from three of the psychologists. The psychologists had assessed the Applicant's risk of re-offending. 

21What emerged was that the Applicant had experienced a difficult and abusive childhood. He had a distant relationship only with his father and his mother was abusive. She would berate and humiliate the Applicant in public, frequently shouting at him across the sports field calling him a 'poofter' when he made a mistake during a soccer game. She physically beat the Applicant and his sisters with her hands and an electric jug lead. 

22The mother washed the Applicant in a bath until he was 12 years old despite his protests. Even after that age he was accorded no privacy when bathing. His mother made him wash his sisters' underwear when they were in their teens. One or both of the sisters was sexually abused by their mother's father to the knowledge of their mother who simply responded by saying that it had happened to her as well. 

23When the Applicant was 11 years old he was groped in a toilet block after a soccer game. The perpetrator threatened the Applicant's life in the process of assaulting him. He was physically injured by the assault but told his parents he had been injured at soccer. 

24When he was 12 years of age he was groped by boys who were 3 to 4 years older than he was. 

25Although his sexual interests were for men he has struggled with his sexuality for many years until recent times. Part of the struggle involved him entering into a relationship with a woman in his early 20s. His mother reacted to this by threatening to commit suicide if the Applicant continued to see the woman. The relationship with the woman broke down subsequently. He subsequently attempted a heterosexual relationship at the age of 40 but it did not work out. 

26He gave conflicting evidence to those who interviewed him about whether he was in a permanent relationship with another man. 

27He claimed not to be sexually attracted to children but to young men who were well above the age of consent but considerably younger than he was. 

28In terms of his risk of re-offending assessments by psychologists Sharon Klamer and Katherine Sahm for Corrective Services NSW assessed him at a moderate to high risk of re-offending based on a number of measures including the Static 99. Their conclusion was that it seems likely the Applicant possessed an ongoing deviant sexual interest in children. They thought that might be related to his victimisation as a child, in addition to his difficult childhood, and his limited ability to express himself. That assessment was conducted after he had been charged in relation to the Brighton offence but before those assessing him had become aware of the later offences. 

29He was then reassessed by Katherine Sahm who concluded that the further charges and conviction for offences resulting from the online chat with an undercover police officer raised his risk considerations to high. She though his behaviour had escalated somewhat, agreeing with the psychologist Mr Webster that it might be an indication of a ""cry for help"". In any event, the new offence further supported an intensive treatment intervention.

30The comprehensive report from Gerard Webster, a forensic psychologist, said that in relation to the offences the Applicant had largely taken the stance of denial and minimisation in relation to sexually abusing the child recorded in the movie. This was primarily because he failed to recognise the behaviours that had been engaged in by him which enabled the movie to be brought about such as fantasising, grooming and manipulating the child into a situation where he could be exposed, touched and filmed. 

31Mr Webster thought that, although the Applicant's sexual offending may have strong origins in his own trauma, his recidivism risk is assumed to be the same as those who sexually abuse simply for sexual gratification. In relation to static variables, Mr Webster thought his risk fell either in the moderate-low risk category for sexually abusing children in the future or the moderate-high risk category.

32The psychologists were in agreement that if the Applicant were to be incarcerated he should undertake the CUBIT program whilst in custody to address his sexual offending. 

Grounds of appeal

Ground 1 - Count 1 - error regarding the fixed term

33Count 1 related to an offence contrary to s 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900. At the time of the commission of the offence the offence carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Section 45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 precludes the imposition of a fixed term for an offence that attracts a standard non-parole period. The Crown accepted that the Sentencing Judge had erred this regard. 

34The fixed term of imprisonment reflects the non-parole period component of a sentence: R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at 161. As Ground 3 alleges that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive it will be necessary to reconsider the particular sentence for Count 1, including whether applying the principle in R v Dunn is appropriate.

Ground 2 - Count 2 - Maximum penalty

35His Honour said in his Remarks on Sentence that the Commonwealth Parliament had established a maximum penalty of 15 years in respect of Count 2. In fact, the correct maximum penalty at the relevant time was 10 years imprisonment (s 479.19(1)(a)(iii) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)). The increase in the maximum penalty to 15 years came into effect on 15 April 2010. Both Count 2 and the offence on the Form 16BA were committed prior to April 2010. 

36The Crown accepted that the error was a material error but submitted that the issue was whether it had been shown in the circumstances that some lesser sentence in law was warranted.

37The Crown said that it did not submit that no sentence less severe was warranted and pointed to the following matters for consideration on the appropriate penalty:

(a) the content of the child pornography transmitted in the principal charge (masturbation by a ten year child in front of a web cam), 

(b) the quantity involved (only one item), 

(c)the fact that it was transmitted to only one person who was an adult, 

(d)no payment was received or requested for the transmission, and 

(e)what appears to have been the relatively limited sophistication used by the Applicant to transmit the material. 

38A further consideration is, as the Applicant submitted, that Commonwealth offences carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment or less are capable of summary disposition. If this offence had been dealt with in the Local Court the maximum penalty was two years imprisonment and/or a fine of 120 penalty units. The Sentencing Judge's belief about the maximum penalty meant that he did not give any consideration to the possibility that the offence might have been dealt with in the Local Court. 

39All of these matters lead to the view that consideration of the appropriate sentence for Count 2 should be dealt with when considering whether the overall sentence is manifestly excessive under Ground 3. 

Ground 3 - manifest excess

40The structure of the sentencing was that Count 2 was accumulated on Count 1 by one year, and Count 3 was accumulated on Count 2 by the entirety of the sentence for Count 2, being 3 years. There was a very large variation in the statutory ratio in relation to Count 3 but his Honour's reason for that was said to be the accumulation of Count 3 on Count 2. 

41Because of the errors made by the Sentencing Judge it is necessary to reconsider each of the sentences individually as well as the overall sentence for the offences, particularly because the offences are all of a similar kind and appear to have derived at least partly from the Applicant's childhood and upbringing. 


Count 1 

42If one was simply to apply the principle in R v Dunn to the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge the Applicant would be sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and, ordinarily, a balance of term of one year. Since there was an early plea those sentences would represent a reduction of 25% with the result that the nominal starting point for the sentence would have been five years and four months. The maximum penalty for this offence was ten years. 

43On any view of the offence it was at a low level of seriousness. Whilst Spigelman CJ pointed out in DBW v R [2007] NSWCCA 236 at [39] that the public and the courts have become much more aware of, and knowledgeable about, the effects of child sexual abuse in the last few years, the present matter can be distinguished to some extent. The Sentencing Judge accepted a statement from counsel for the Applicant, a matter that was conceded by the Crown, that the police had spoken to the boy involved, that there was no evidence of any harm or ongoing harm as a consequence of the offending and that the child could not recall ever having had a video taken of him nor could he remember being washed or anything about the incident.

44The Applicant is entitled to a discount of 25% for an early plea. Taking into account the low level of seriousness of the offence (whilst not ignoring the fact that the Applicant established the child care arrangements which enabled him to engage in the conduct concerned), the fact that there was only the one incident as a result of that childcare arrangement, the fact that the Applicant had at the time no prior convictions (there being no evidence in relation to s 21A(5A) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 either before the Sentencing Judge or this Court) and the strong subjective case arising out of the Applicant's background, an appropriate starting point for the sentence is a non-parole period of two years. By reason of the 25% discount that will result in a sentence of an 18 month non-parole period, with an additional term of 6 months. 

Count 2

45In Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; (2010) 201 A Crim R 243 at [94] RA Hulme J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed) listed a number of matters that he said may be relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or dissemination/ transmission of child pornography. It is not necessary to set out those matters here. In relation to the Count 2 offence itself the only significant matters from those listed were the fact that the video depicted an actual child masturbating and that the child was aged approximately ten years. The fact that the material was sent only to an undercover police officer, that the Applicant acted alone (apart from having accessed the video from the internet) and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was in any way connected to the production of the material means that the offence should be regarded as having a reasonably low level of seriousness. The material that formed the basis of the Form 16BA offence was at an even lower level in that it simply involved an email or like communication involving the Applicant's fantasies. 

46Bearing in mind again that his Honour gave a 25% discount for an early plea, the imposition of a fixed term of 3 years meant that the starting point for sentence was a 4 year fixed term. In my opinion, that was outside the range of appropriate sentences given the relative low level of seriousness of the offending. 

47In my opinion, a more appropriate starting point would have been a fixed term of 20 months imprisonment with the result, following the discount, that the sentence ought to have been a fixed term of 15 months imprisonment. 

Count 3

48In my opinion, the matters charged in Count 3 were arguably the most serious of the offences for which the Applicant was sentenced. When one has regard to the total number of images, and to the number of them rated at level 4 and level 5 on the Oliver scale, the sentence imposed in respect of Count 3 was wholly inadequate. Nevertheless, there is no Crown appeal against that sentence, and the matter of that sentence falls only to be determined by the application of the principle of totality by the appropriate accumulation of the sentences in respect of the other counts.

49In my opinion the Applicant should be sentenced overall to a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, with an additional term of 2 years and 9 months. I consider there are special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of the sentences and by reason of the matters discussed by the Sentencing Judge in relation to treatment programs both inside and outside prison. In my opinion the appropriate structuring of the sentences is as follows:


Count 1 - a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 9 March 2010 and expiring 8 September 2011 with a balance of term of 6 months;
Count 2 - a fixed term of 15 months commencing 9 June 2011 and expiring 8 September 2012;
Count 3 - a non-parole period of 3 months commencing 9 September 2012 and expiring 8 December 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring 8 September 2015 

50There is the further matter of whether an order should be made under s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and whether it should be made in respect of both Counts 1 and 3. The aggregate term exceeds 3 years but the individual sentences are each less than that period. Count 2 is a Commonwealth offence where s 50 has no application. The Sentencing Judge made no such order. The parties did not address the matter in the submissions already filed nor at the hearing of the appeal. I propose that the parties have seven days to make any further submissions concerning this matter.

51I propose the following orders:

(1) Leave to appeal granted.

(2) Allow the appeal

(3) Quash the sentences imposed by Judge Woods QC.

(4) In lieu sentence the Appellant as follows:

(a) In respect of Count 1 and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 9 March 2010 and expiring 8 September 2011 with a balance of term of 6 months;


(b) In respect of Count 2 and taking into account the matter on the Form 16BA, a fixed term of 15 months commencing 9 June 2011 and expiring 8 September 2012;

(c) In respect of Count 3, a non-parole period of 3 months commencing 9 September 2012 and expiring 8 December 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months expiring 8 September 2015. 

(5) Direct the parties to file any further submissions they wish to make concerning the requirement or otherwise of a further order pursuant to s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

		10 September 2012",2012-09-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760056,Tiwary v R [2012] NSWCCA 193,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 26 July 2012, the Court made orders extending time for filing the notice of appeal, allowing the appeal, quashing the convictions of the appellant for the murders of Chow Lyang Tay and Poh Chuan Tan and ordering the entry of verdicts of acquittal on the counts of murder of Mr Tay and Mr Tan. Leave to appeal (the matter not being a question of law only) was granted at the beginning of the hearing. These are the reasons of the Court for those orders.

2There were two grounds to the appeal. The first (which we would reject) asserted an error in the learned primary judge (Johnson J) failing to exclude certain expert evidence, pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 137. The second (which we would allow) asserted that the jury verdicts (which were by majority) were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, for the purposes and within the meaning of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1).

3It is convenient to deal with the first ground after we have considered the evidence and the issues that arise on the evidence for the purposes of determining the second ground of appeal.

The task for this Court

4The principles upon which this Court should act under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1), are authoritatively stated in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at 405-406 [11]-[14], M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493 and 494-495, and Kurdi v R [2011] NSWCCA 179 at [3]-[18]. Notwithstanding that there may as a matter of law be evidence to sustain a guilty verdict, a court of criminal appeal must ask itself on the whole of the evidence as a question of fact whether there is a reasonable doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that a court which experiences such a doubt may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.

5The appellant had previously been tried and convicted of both murders in 2006. Those convictions were overturned on appeal: Tiwary v R [2008] NSWCCA 319. Neither of the flaws in the first trial which led to the quashing of the verdicts affected the second trial. 

The facts

6Sometime between about 12.15 pm and 2.15 pm on Monday, 15 September 2003, two university students, Mr Tay and Mr Tan, were murdered in premises in Kensington which they had occupied as co-tenants with the appellant. Their bodies with their heads brutally bludgeoned were located by police after they responded to a 000 call placed by the appellant at 2.20 or 2.21 pm. 

7The premises comprised the upper floor of a duplex which fronted on to Barker Street, Kensington, within easy walking distance of the University of New South Wales campus. The lower level of the duplex was occupied by the owners, Mr and Mrs Lichaa. The upstairs unit was accessed from Barker Street by a set of stairs partially enclosed by the brick façade of the building leading to the front door at the top of the stairs. From the rear it was accessed via a set of external stairs onto a balcony extending the width of the building to a backdoor. A driveway extending from Barker Street along the eastern side of the building provided access to the rear concrete yard, garages and the rear external stairs through wrought iron side gates. Upon entering the front door a hallway extended into an open lounge room from which a rear door opened on to the external balcony. From the front door, Mr Tan's bedroom was the first room on the left followed by the bathroom, the appellant's bedroom and the kitchen. Mr Tay's bedroom was the second room on the right after an unoccupied bedroom immediately adjacent to the front door.

8Mr Tay was found lying on his back behind a settee in the lounge room in a large area of pooled blood. There were deposits of his clotted blood on a computer located on a nearby desk. There were extensive areas of blood staining (both wiped and spattered) on the surrounding walls. 

9Mr Tan was found slumped with his back against the wall beside the closed front door. There were extensive areas of blood staining in that area. 

10Mr Tay was apparently bludgeoned in the north eastern part of the living room, adjacent to his computer. Mr Tan was first attacked in the living room, where his broken spectacles and pieces of teeth were found; he was apparently chased up the hall to the front door, where he was repeatedly bludgeoned and then stabbed.

11In each case the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head with consequent brain injury consistent with both deceased being struck multiple times on the top of the head (Tan) and back of the head (Tay) under considerable force with a baseball bat. These injuries would have produced an immediate state of deep unconsciousness in each of the deceased ultimately leading to death. Mr Tan also suffered multiple injuries to his face, including a broken nose and broken teeth. 

12In the view of Dr Duflou, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy, the combined appearance of Mr Tan's head injuries suggested that at least five or up to 10 blows were delivered to his head and a number of blows to the front of his face. Mr Tan also sustained five penetrating stab wounds to the right-hand side of his neck which, because of the presence of inhaled blood in his lungs, and frothy blood within the nose and mouth, justified them being included in the cause of death. One of the stab wounds passed into the voice box and one into the base of the tongue and back of the oesophagus. Mr Tan also had defensive stab wounds to the backs of both hands. 

13Dr Duflou gave evidence that the wounds to the neck were likely to have been inflicted after Mr Tan suffered the head injuries, likely while he was unconscious, and that he would not have survived for any significant period after the wounds to the neck were inflicted. 

14Mr Tay also sustained a single stab wound to the neck. In Dr Duflou's view the lack of bleeding into his lungs suggested that the stab wound was inflicted either at or about the time of death or shortly after. For this reason it was not included as a cause of death. In Dr Duflou's opinion, a minimum of two extremely forceful blows were delivered to the back of Mr Tay's head. He also had a defensive injury to his left-hand index finger and a superficial stab wound to his forehead. The combined effect of the evidence collected at autopsy, including the views of Dr Rodriguez, a consultant neuropathologist, indicated that Mr Tay survived in a state of deep unconsciousness for about two hours after sustaining the head injuries, before he was stabbed in the neck. 
15On this analysis, the stab wounds to the neck of both deceased were likely to have been inflicted at about the same time, and at or about the same time that Mr Tan's head injuries were inflicted, that is, some time after 2.00 pm and before 2.20pm 
16The fact that Tan and Tay were fatally assaulted (and, subject to the remarks below about the possibility of a second baseball bat, very likely by the use of the same or similar weapons) at different times over a period of about two hours was consistent with other evidence relied upon by the Crown at trial, in particular the proven movements of Mr Tan shortly after midday to 2.00 pm when he was either en route to university, at university or returning from university. It was the appellant's case that he was in the unit at the time of the murder of Mr Tay but asleep, though waking momentarily at the sound of a fall, and that later he was awakened in the course of Mr Tan being fatally assaulted, but that he did not emerge from his bedroom (through fear) and therefore did not identify the assailant or assailants. 
17A bloodied knife and baseball bat were located by police in the unit. The knife was found under Mr Tan's right leg. (It was likely that police moved Mr Tan's body to some extent as they forced entry through the front door and that the knife or the body were forced into closer alignment for that reason.) The baseball bat was located leaning against the wall inside the appellant's bedroom. Mr Tan's blood was identified on both items. There was none of Mr Tay's blood detected on either item. Mr Tan's blood was identified in discrete locations on the appellant's feet, hands and shorts. None of Mr Tay's blood or DNA was detected on the appellant or his clothing. There were faint stains on his long sleeved sweater, which tested positive to a presumptive blood test.
18It was the Crown case that the appellant assaulted Mr Tay with the baseball bat after Mr Tan left the unit shortly after midday and then assaulted Mr Tan with the same weapon within a short time of him returning to the unit at around 2.00 pm, after which he then stabbed both of the deceased in the neck before ringing 000 to report the murders which he attributed to an unknown assailant or assailants. The murders were alleged by the Crown on the appeal to be premeditated and that the appellant executed his plan alone with care and precision over the course of two hours, taking appropriate measures to ensure that there was little or no blood on him or his clothing which would implicate him as the murderer before he alerted the authorities and falsely claimed that he came across the bodies of his flatmates on emerging from his bedroom. 

19The Crown submissions on appeal differed, importantly, from the Crown case at the trial. There, it seemed to be the Crown case that while there was a dispute simmering between Mr Tay and the appellant over money, the killing of Mr Tay occurred fortuitously, he not having attended his morning lectures, and that Mr Tan was killed when he arrived home from university because he discovered Tay's dead body and knew the appellant had killed him. Further, at the trial, such blood as there was on the appellant was said to have been medium velocity spattering that occurred during the battering of Mr Tan. On the appeal, it was effectively conceded that unless the appellant had washed immediately after killing Mr Tan (of which there was literally no evidence) and immediately prior to the 000 emergency call, there were three available explanations for the (not extensive) blood of Mr Tan on the appellant: spattering from the Tan murder, expirated blood coughed by Mr Tan onto the appellant who was near him as he was dying, and both spattered and expirated blood. The difficulty for the Crown case in those circumstances was that, on one available explanation, the (not extensive) blood on the appellant came from Mr Tan coughing as the appellant claimed and that despite having bashed Mr Tan in the face and around the head with the bat in the living room, chased him up the corridor where he repeatedly bludgeoned his head, and stabbed him in the neck, the appellant had little blood on him either at all or until the blood coughed by Mr Tan.
20The Crown submitted at trial that the absence of any of Mr Tay's blood on the appellant was explained by the opportunity he had to wash himself in the interval before Mr Tan returned to the unit (and that he disposed of any blood stained clothing or towels in this same time frame) or because there may not have been back spatter given that the staining around Tay's body appeared to be directional.
21The absence of any of Mr Tay's blood on the baseball bat and the knife was said by the Crown to be explained either because the appellant cleaned them before using them on Tan or that Tan's blood masked the residue of Tay's blood on both weapons. 
22The Crown case theory was in direct conflict with the appellant's account given first to the 000 operator and then to police on emerging from the unit and thereafter in the course of extensive formal questioning. In summary, he said he was disturbed from sleep by the sound of something falling in the flat beyond his closed door on one occasion during the morning, but went back to sleep without checking to see what the source of the noise might be; and later he was disturbed from sleep a second time by a loud noise, after which he heard the sound of someone calling for help. When he emerged from his bedroom after barricading himself in until the noise ceased, he saw Mr Tan slumped at the front door. He told police that he found Mr Tay deceased in the lounge room while he was checking the unit for intruders, after which he telephoned 000. He said that while he was on the phone to 000, but while the operator had him on hold while she was making contact with the ambulance and police, he checked Mr Tan for a carotid pulse, at which time Tan coughed and expirated blood on him.

23At the trial the Crown conceded that the persistence of conflict between the experts allowed for the reasonable possibility that Mr Tan's blood on the appellant's feet and ankles was expirated blood emitted by an involuntary cough reflex when a body reacts to blood in the airways, even in a state of deep unconsciousness, at any time up to brain stem death. At the first trial there was a considerable conflict between experts for the Crown and the appellant on this issue. Whilst there remained an area of dispute between two opposing experts at the retrial, the Crown effectively conceded that the blood staining on the appellant may have been expirated blood, but maintained the submission that Mr Tan was so deeply unconscious by reason of his massive head injuries that he could not achieve a cough reflex and that medium velocity impact spatter deposited in the course of the assault was the more probable explanation for Tan's blood on the appellant's feet and ankles. 

24Whilst the reasonable possibility that the blood droplets were expirated blood was not a complete answer to the Crown case at trial, on the appeal the Crown conceded that the reasonable possibility that the blood was expirated was consistent with the appellant's account to police that Tan ""spasmed"" and coughed blood as he was checking him for signs of life after the murder and that the relatively small amount of blood on his feet and ankles was inconsistent with the nature and extent of Tan's injuries revealed at post mortem and the spread of blood at the crime scene. This makes it unnecessary to explore in detail the respective evidence of Dr Fulde and Dr Matheson. It suffices for present purposes, given the approach of the Crown on appeal, to say that we find Dr Matheson's views persuasive for at least three related reasons. First, Dr Fulde's evidence was a generalisation from what he had not seen in his experience: coughing of unconscious persons. Secondly, Dr Fulde accepted that with respect to serious head injuries, his staff at the trauma unit at St Vincent's Hospital would call upon the expertise of neurosurgeons. Thirdly, Dr Matheson, an experienced neurosurgeon, not only had a sound medical and theoretical foundation for his view that an unconscious patient near death from brain injury could cough expirated blood, but also he had personally witnessed it. Further, this conjecture as to whether this was expirated blood could have been resolved by analysing the blood spots for the presence of saliva. This test was not conducted. In the light of this material, the Crown on appeal was plainly correct in accepting the reasonable possibility that the blood on the appellant was either wholly or in some significant part expirated from a cough of Mr Tan.

25On the appeal, the Crown recognised that it had to explain in a rational way consistent only with the guilt of the appellant what happened to the blood that must inevitably have been transferred to the appellant during the bludgeoning of Mr Tan. On appeal, the Crown squarely and fairly confronted the difficulties for its case by reason of the dearth of forensic evidence linking the appellant to the murders. First, there was no blood or DNA of Mr Tay on the appellant. Although he had had two hours to wash, on the Crown case, shortly before calling 000 he had thrust a knife into the neck of the dead or near dead Mr Tay without any blood being transferred in the process. Perhaps more importantly, the Crown accepted that one would reasonably have expected more blood on the appellant had he carried out the sustained and brutal attack on Mr Tan. Whilst such blood as was on him might have been only from the attack, in circumstances where no saliva test was done on the blood said to be expirated, where blood was spotted in discrete areas on the lower parts of the legs and feet and none on the face, hair, shoulders or upper body, a real and significant doubt was raised as to whether the appellant bludgeoned and stabbed Mr Tan. In squarely confronting this difficulty, the Crown recognised that the relative dearth of Mr Tan's blood on the appellant was only inconsistent with guilt if the Crown resisted (as it had at the trial) the argument that the blood on the appellant might have been expirated blood. If the hypothesis of expirated blood was resisted, the dearth of blood on the appellant, though still possible if he had killed Mr Tan, threw up a significant doubt as to that essential fact. Thus, on appeal, the Crown embraced what had been largely resisted below, that the blood on the appellant was expirated from the cough by Mr Tan while he was dying. The embracing of this fact also emphasised what the Crown submitted was a carefully arranged and premeditated plan to kill both men. The dearth of Mr Tan's blood on the appellant and the complete absence of any blood of Mr Tay could be explained by the careful washing of himself after Mr Tan's murder and just before placing the 000 call. Given the absence of blood on any clothes found, he must have killed (at least Mr Tan) naked. Then, having cleaned himself, and put on his shorts, while he was on the phone speaking to the ambulance operator, Mr Tan coughed blood on him. It was then too late to wash again.

26Some discussion took place on appeal as to whether this version of events was put to the jury. It was submitted that it was embedded as an alternative hypothesis. For the reasons that we later give, this way of hypothesising events does not remove the existence of what we perceive as a reasonable doubt as to the appellant being the actor who murdered Mr Tan (and Mr Tay).

The relationship between the appellant and the deceased
27At this point it is helpful to give some background to the three young men concerned. All three, Tay, Tan and the appellant, were Singaporean nationals in their twenties studying engineering at the University of New South Wales (Tay and Tan electrical, and the appellant mechanical engineering) under student visas. They had not known each other prior to coming to Sydney. There was no evidence of any overt animosity between them. They occasionally went out for dinner together and watched films together at home. There was evidence that there had been some domestic disagreements about washing-up and cooking and that this had led to their cooking separately, without any suggestion of this being the source of serious tension or argument. There was no evidence of any illegal activity such as drug use or supply.

28Both Mr Tan and Mr Tay were due to graduate at the end of the 2003 academic year and to return to Singapore. They were both good students attending classes regularly. The academic progress of the appellant was fractured by periods when he was not studying at all, and in other periods when he was repeating subjects that he had failed.

29Mr Tay was described as quiet and reserved and as keeping to himself, though of friendly disposition. He did not interact with others at university to any great extent and did not go out and socialise often. He was described as living a quiet life. Mr Tay was married, his wife being resident in Singapore. His study at university was privately funded. 

30Mr Tan (also known as Tony) was relatively outgoing as compared to Mr Tay, having for example gone to the casino with the appellant on one or two occasions, but also led a generally quiet life. He was (like the appellant) studying on a scholarship from the Singapore Armed Forces. Unlike the appellant, however, he was described as an excellent and committed student. On 24 February 2003, he had married a Singaporean national who was resident in Singapore. She had visited Mr Tan in Sydney in March 2003 and he had returned to Singapore for a visit in June 2003.

31The appellant was described as very outgoing. He had a lot of friends and socialised frequently. He occasionally visited the casino and was described as generous with money. He studied late into the night and his habit was to sleep through the day. His friend Kay Meng Lee, his girlfriend Elvira Metiljevic and his brother gave evidence that he would often sleep until late in the morning and into the afternoon, or get up for a morning lecture and then go back to bed. He supplemented his scholarship from the Singaporean Armed Forces by working part time as a security guard. 

The importance of the appellant's poor academic record

32It was common ground that the appellant had falsified his academic record with a view to concealing his poor performance. The appellant's academic transcript and student debt records were tendered in evidence. The appellant's academic transcript disclosed that he had failed a number of subjects since he began his studies in 2000. The appellant falsely reported to the Singapore Army that he had passed all five of his subjects in semester two of 2001 when the true position was that he had failed four of five subjects in semester one of 2001 and three of five subjects in semester two of that year. On another occasion, he also sent his girlfriend's transcript to his parents, representing that it was his own.

33His academic performance did not improve in 2002. In semester one of 2002 he failed four of seven subjects, and in semester two, four of his six subjects. He did not re-enrol in semester one of 2003. In semester two of that year he successfully completed two of five subjects and was given special consideration in relation to the other three, due to the death of his flatmates. The appellant was blocked from re-enrolment in March 2004, because of outstanding student fees of $5650, which had been due by 16 July 2003. 

34The Crown submitted that one aspect of the appellant's motive for killing Mr Tay and Mr Tan was to conceal his academic failures from the Singapore Armed Forces. It was said that Mr Tan, who was also on a scholarship from the Singapore Armed Forces, might disclose the appellant's poor academic results upon his return to Singapore. Pursuant to the scholarship, a failure to maintain a satisfactory academic performance might end his entitlements and require his sureties (his brother and cousin) to repay what had been expended.

The financial issues and rent

35The unit at Barker Street was tenanted by Mr Tay and the appellant from 2002 with a third person. When that person moved out in early 2003, Mr Tan moved in. Around this time a fourth person also lived in the unit. He moved out in approximately July 2003 leaving the fourth bedroom vacant. Tay and Tan and the appellant were covering the rent until a replacement flatmate could be found. The rent for the unit was $2172.60, due on the 13th of each month. Mr Tay had authorised a direct debit from his account to cover the total monthly rent and he would then be reimbursed by Mr Tan and the appellant for their respective shares. Up to and including August 2003, the rent was paid on time, except for one occasion in October 2002. 

36A document apparently prepared by Mr Tay and recovered during a search of the unit suggested that in August 2003 the appellant owed him $5054.00 for bills, rent for August 2003 of $543 and further accumulated debt, the origin of which was not explained. A forensic accountant gave evidence in the Crown case that the accumulated debt likely represented eight months of unpaid rent. He also gave evidence that on the basis of the appellant's bank statements from Australian bank accounts, it seemed that he had not been reimbursing Tay for his share of the rent since March 2003. 

37Mr Chaw gave evidence that while he was staying in the empty room in the unit for a short time in July 2003, the appellant told him that a friend was supposed to move into the room and that while he did not know whether the appellant told him the name of the person, he knew the person was called Andrew and that he was an Australian from Bathurst. 

38When questioned by the police the appellant denied knowing anyone called Andrew. He stated that he had met someone who initially said he ""wouldn't mind moving in, but then he moved in with his sister"", and that he had mentioned this person to Mr Tan and Mr Tay. He could not recall this person's name, but remembered that he studied aerospace engineering and said he would recognise him on sight. He gave the police the name of a friend, Zodin, whom he thought would recall this person's name. There does not appear, from the transcript of the trial, to have been any follow up with Zodin, who, it appears, was a member of the appellant's group of friends. The appellant's girlfriend, his friend and his brother also gave evidence they had never heard the appellant mention a friend by the name of Andrew. In a statement, Mr Tan's wife also stated she had never heard of any mention of an Andrew moving into the house. The Crown submission was that the appellant had made up Andrew, in order that Mr Tay begin billing ""Andrew"" for a quarter of the rent monthly, thereby alleviating some of the debt mounting on him.

39Mr Tay had told friends that when he and Mr Tan returned to Singapore at the end of the academic year, the appellant would assume responsibility for paying the total rent. Two emails of Mr Tay (one of 14 July 2003 to the appellant and the other of 19 July 2003 to Mr Tan) refer to a friend of the appellant moving in and a person named 'Andrew'.

40The appellant had one Australian bank account, and access to a Diner's Club Account card. According to the forensic accountant the appellant's account was opened on 14 August 2002, with an opening balance of $11.32 and a deposit of $15,835.58 was received from from Hohitashwa Tiwary (the appellant's father), part of which was used for university fees. The account was dormant from December 2002 to March 2003. In April 2003, $7,300 was credited to the account, which was used to pay university fees. On 17th April a further $2106.52 was credited to the account. This was the final credit until two salary payments from Integrated Security of $204 and $931.50 were made on 28 August 2003 and 10 September 2003 respectively. During the period between April and September 2003, the appellant's bank account gradually declined with his Westpac Account balance being $7.26 on 5 September 2003. Cash withdrawals were also made from the appellant's Diner's Club Account card. As at 10th September 2003 the appellant had $738.76 in his bank account and available credit of approximately A$1200 on his Diners Club card. 

41There was evidence, however, from the appellant's brother that the appellant had ready access to money provided by their father through a Singaporean bank account. 

42It is unnecessary to describe in detail all the evidence concerning the financial records found on Mr Tay's computer, including what appeared to be indebtedness of the appellant and a projected inflow from ""Andrew"". The appellant in his interview with the police said he was up to date with his rent.

43There was also evidence from Mr Chaw of a conversation between the appellant and Mr Tay in the days or weeks before the murders in which Mr Tay asked the appellant whether he had paid the rent, to which the appellant responded that he had, but that he had had an argument with the real estate agent. Mr Chaw described Mr Tay as ""quite stingy"" and unlikely to lend large amounts of money.

44The Crown relied upon this financial analysis to support the submission that the appellant was in financial difficulties and that this set the scene for a dispute with Mr Tay which erupted on the morning of the murders because Mr Tay did not go to university that day. The Crown submitted that the dispute got out of hand and that the appellant killed Tay. The Crown then submitted that having killed Tay, the appellant killed Tan when he returned home to cover the murder and because Mr Tan would have been in a position to inform the authorities of the events precipitating the dispute between the two men. On appeal, there was asserted to be a significantly greater degree of pre-mediation to events as, and for the reasons, described earlier.

Mr Tay's marriage and incipient relationship with Ms Jasmine Tan in Singapore

45Mr Tay was married. Records were produced and tendered of online discussions between him and a young woman in Singapore, Ms Jasmine Tan (no relation to the deceased Mr Tan). She was a former university friend of Mr Tay, and engaged to be married. The records revealed that they spoke every few days from mid June to early July 2003. They sometimes spoke for minutes and sometimes hours, discussing their daily lives, travel plans and desires to visit each other. The conversations involved terms of endearment, were sometimes flirtatious and occasionally sexual. On occasions Mr Tay makes clear his emotional and sexual attraction to Ms Tan. The contents implied that Tay had not had intimate sexual contact with Ms Tan. Records of conversations after 3 July were not produced at the trial; but a text message was sent by Ms Tan to Mr Tay's phone on 16 September that suggested they had remained in contact. The message was: ""Dear, pls reply if u r okay. U r makg mi very worried. Please!"" In a statement at the trial, Ms Tan explained that she sent the message after having seen the news on television that two Singaporean students had been killed in Sydney.

46There was a suggestion by defence counsel at the trial and on appeal that the incipient relationship may have been the source of an unknown assailant's motive to kill Mr Tay. The Crown tendered immigration records to show that neither Ms Tan nor her future husband were in Australia at the time of the murders. Both Ms Tan and Mrs Tay (who was aware of Mr Tay's friendship with Ms Tan) denied any affair. In a statement, Mr Tan's wife noted that Mr Tay was not wearing his wedding ring when she visited, but he was wearing it when his wife visited.

The baseball bat

47On the afternoon of Saturday 13 September 2003 the appellant purchased a black softball or baseball bat from a sports store in the city. This was the bat recovered at the scene by the police with the blood of Mr Tan (but not Mr Tay) found on it.

48The first ground of appeal (the asserted wrongful failure to reject evidence) concerned an aspect of the murder scene connected with the bat. Samples of black paint were obtained from the western wall of the unit, one from the eastern wall and a third from the bat itself. The places from which the samples were recovered on the walls were consistent with marks that may have been made during the attacks on both Mr Tay and Mr Tan. Ms Dusting gave evidence that all three samples were indistinguishable in some test results from each other having regard to colour, fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. She said, however, that further tests of the two samples were inconclusive because those last results could not be replicated. She provided an opinion that the results ""slightly supported"" the contention that the black paint on the two walls came from the bat. The tests did not reveal any paint from the walls on the bat. In [6] and [9]-[10] of his reasons for judgment admitting Ms Dusting's evidence, the trial judge summarised the issue and its significance:

""[6]The issue flowing from the inconclusive micro-XRF test is that Ms Dusting was not able to demonstrate what could be described as a two-way transfer, namely, transfer of paint on the wall to the bat. She explained in evidence (T882.34) that there could be a number of reasons why a two-way transfer did not occur. She expressed the opinion that the evidence of a one-way transfer slightly supported the proposition that the black paint on the eastern and western walls could have come from the black paint on the softball bat. The opinion 'slightly supports' was expressed in a range of opinions, with 'slightly supports' being above 'inconclusive' but below 'supports', 'strongly supports' and 'very strongly supports'.

...

[9]There is a significant fact in issue in the proceedings as to whether the softball bat was used as a murder weapon on Tay as well as Tan. The present state of the evidence is that no blood of Tay was located on the softball bat.

[10]The juxtaposition of the black marks on the eastern and western walls next to blood stains from Tay and Tan respectively is capable of shedding light upon that question. The evidence of Ms Dusting, it seems to me, is probative of that fact. It is not merely a question, as the Accused submits, of some broad submission that there is some similarity between the paint on the bat and the paint on the walls. Ms Dusting is able to take it a step further as a result of her testing. It is probative in my view.""

49There was evidence from a student colleague of Mr Tan (a Mr Teo) that, about two to three weeks before the murders, Mr Tan had said to Mr Teo that he had bought a baseball bat for protection. No second bat was found on the premises.

50The appellant told police that he purchased the bat for recreational purposes.

Aspects of the events and circumstances of 15 September

51Mr Tay was bludgeoned shortly after midday; Mr Tan sometime around or shortly after 2.00 pm. Some aspects of the day about which there is no dispute should be noted. Their significance can be seen in the hypotheses advanced at the trial and on appeal, by the Crown and the defence, and in any other rational hypothesis consistent with innocence.

52The appellant's girlfriend, Ms Metiljevic, telephoned him at 6.30 am. They spoke for half an hour, arranging to meet at 2.00 pm after an exam she was sitting. After 2.00 pm, he not having turned up or answered her texts, she sent him a text saying, ""I guess you're still sleeping, bye.""

53There was evidence from Ms Metiljevic and others that the appellant often slept late in the day and into the afternoon. The appellant had worked as a security guard on Saturday night until midnight and all Sunday.

54The appellant told the police that he got up after speaking with Ms Metiljevic, had some breakfast, washed up and went back to his room and went to sleep again.

55Mr Tay's laptop computer was last used at 10.16 am and Mr Tan's at 12.02 pm.

56Both Mr Tay and Mr Tan had a lecture that day. Unusually, Mr Tay did not attend it. The evidence was that he always attended class. Mr Tan attended his midday lecture but arrived at least 15 minutes late. The walk from the unit (where his computer had been used at 12.02 pm) and the university was short. Student colleagues gave evidence that Mr Tan appeared somewhat dishevelled, distracted and tired.

57The previous Thursday, Mr Tay and Mr Tan had arranged with Mr Teo (the fellow student) to meet after the Monday noon lecture to organise a seminar for ethics in engineering. After the lecture, in the lecture hall, Mr Tan said he wanted to cancel the meeting. No reason was given. Mr Teo took it that this was being done on behalf of Mr Tay also. Mr Teo gave the time for this conversation as ""just after 2.00 pm"".

58Other students saw Mr Tan that day after the lecture. Mr Kheng Chai said that the lecture finished about 1.50 pm or 1.55 pm, after which he spoke to Mr Tan who ""appeared to be uneasy"". Mr Chai said, ""He was shaking from side to side. Alan [another student] said something like 'what's going on?' Tony then said 'I have to go to the toilet urgently'."" He did not return. Mr Jeff Lum spoke to Mr Tan briefly after the lecture ended, which he said was ""around 1.45 to 2.00 pm"". He said he ""seemed normal"". Stephen Tay said Mr Tan looked very tired, but otherwise normal; Mr Tan told him that he was going home to sleep. Mr Choon Poh was at the lecture. He said it finished at 1.55 pm. He said that Mr Tan said at the end of the class that he needed to go to the toilet.

59Jonathan Choy and Sean Murray met Mr Tan on the stairs adjacent to the exit from the university. Mr Choy said Mr Tan looked pre-occupied with something; Mr Choy said that Mr Tan did not, as he usually would, answer and smile. Mr Choy saw Mr Tan get into a four door white car with three people in it. The car was parked facing the wrong way in a one way street. He thought the three occupants were Asian. He did not recognise them. Mr Choy's timing said this was at about 1.45 to 1.50 pm. Mr Murray also saw Mr Tan get in the car and, as he approached it, take his backpack off. Mr Murray recalled the car as dark colour. He said the occupants were Asian.

60From this evidence it can be inferred that Mr Tan, who was somewhat preoccupied and not his usual self, met three unidentified people in a car by some pre-arrangement at about 1.55 to 2.00 pm, possibly slightly before or after that timeframe. He was then driven what was a short walk of only hundreds of metres to his flat. There, within the next ten to fifteen minutes, he was murdered. On the Crown case these people must have dropped Mr Tan at home and driven off. No one from the car came forward, despite a degree of publicity about the murders. A number of students who knew the deceased came forward to assist the police. There was evidence of news coverage of the murders in newspapers and the electronic media in Australia and Singapore. The police sent out media releases seeking information concerning the car Mr Tan got into. 

61Although the timing and sequence is not precise, it would appear from the above evidence that Mr Tan probably got home just before or just after 2.00 pm, perhaps as late as somewhat after 2.05 pm if Mr Teo's recollection was accurate.

62Upon getting into the unit, the evidence permits the conclusion that Mr Tan began to cook a meal. One of the two police officers who first entered the premises upon responding to the 000 call, Sergeant Newton, entered the kitchen and found a saucepan with a number of chicken wings in it. The element was on high and the bottom of the chicken was burnt. Sergeant Newton observed that ""it did appear that the chicken had only been cooking for a short time."" The photographs in evidence show six to eight pieces of chicken. Given the observation of Sergeant Newton and the fact that the heat was on high and some burning had occurred, it is unlikely that Mr Tay was responsible for cooking the chicken in light of the unchallenged evidence that he was bludgeoned shortly after midday. If Mr Tan did so, as is probable, it would have taken some further time after he arrived home, presumably not having seen the near dead Mr Tay at the other end of the unit. Also, whilst he may have been very hungry or cooking to keep some food for later, the quantity of food is consistent with preparing food for himself and another person or other persons. It is to be recalled that one disagreement that the flatmates had was over washing up and they did not cook for each other. It is also unlikely that if Mr Tiwary was the murderer of Mr Tay, and was lying in wait to despatch Mr Tan upon his return from his noon lecture that he would put on food at about the time of Mr Tan's expected return.

63By now the time must have been some time after 2.00 pm, perhaps 2.10 pm if Mr Teo's recollection was accurate.

64By 2.20 or 2.21 pm Mr Tan was dead, the call to 000 being made at that time.

65The appellant was in the unit. The question for this Court is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that he murdered Mr Tan having some two hours earlier bludgeoned Mr Tay near to death?

The plausibility of the Crown case

66The Crown case was plausible. The appellant was in the unit at all relevant times on the day of the murders. The attack on Mr Tan was two hours after that on Mr Tay.

67The Crown relied upon the appellant having a motive to kill Mr Tay because of impecuniosity and unfulfilled financial obligations; to kill Mr Tan to conceal the earlier murder of Tay; to kill both to conceal his university failures and to prevent disclosure of his fabricated academic record, which would have obligated him to reimburse a large sum of money to the Singapore Army.

68The appellant had the means to kill both deceased. He had purchased the bat. The knife was readily available. He had trained as a commando.

69The appellant had knowledge of the movements and lecture times of his colleagues.

70Mr Tay had remained at the unit, missing class (unusually) to confront the appellant over the unpaid rent and to deal with the taking over of the lease.

71The injuries to the back of the head of Mr Tay indicated a surprise attack.

72The chair at the end of the settee, behind which the battered body of Mr Tay was found, was placed to hide the presence of the body from Mr Tan upon his return later in the day.

73There was no evidence of forced entry. The owners had the side gates locked until their return at about 1.45 pm.

74There was no evidence of robbery.

75Upon Mr Tan's return, after he had begun to cook the chicken, he was attacked in the living room.

76There was a positive presumptive test for blood and the DNA of all three in the bathroom basin waste.

77One of the owners downstairs who saw the appellant leave along the side of the building on arrival of the police (the appellant having left via the back stairs) did not notice anyone else leaving the building from where he was at the rear of the downstairs unit. The position of Mr Tan almost immediately adjacent to the front door (making it difficult for Sergeant Newton to get in without pushing the body) made it highly unlikely that anyone could have left via the front door.

78While the appellant was (according to his version) in his room either asleep or barricaded in, in fear, the keys to his room were in the lock on the hall side of the door, visible to the assailant or assailants who (on his version) committed the murders. They thus killed his flatmates without apparently despatching him as a potential witness.

79The absence of any significant amount of spattered blood on the appellant was consistent with cleaning after Tay's murder (for which there was time) and after Tan's murder (for which there was a short time, before he made the 000 call).

The appellant's account

80The appellant did not give evidence at either trial. There was, however, ample evidence of his account to emergency services and police of various degrees of contemporaneity.

81The appellant stated the following in his initial 000 call to the Telstra operator before being transferred to the ambulance service:

""Good morning, I need the police and an ambulance
...

There's been a murder, two"".

82Then, after giving his location, the Telstra operator said ""connecting ambulance"". The telephone then began to ring as if the call was being transferred. At this, the appellant appears to become distraught, even hysterical, saying loudly:

""What the fuck, what the fuck, what, why are you fucking transferring me?! What the fuck. Ahh.""

83The ambulance emergency operator then came on the line. The appellant said amongst other things:

""I, I need the ambulance and the police. There's been a murder ... My, my two friends are lying dead outside ... There's blood all over the place.""

He was asked:

""""What I want to know is exactly what has happened there.""

He said:

""I have no idea. I was asleep and I heard this screaming, and I, when I turned my two friends are dead.""

The exchange continued (V1 being the ambulance operator and V2 the appellant):

""""V1When you say they're dead, are they definitely unconscious?

V2There's blood all over, I can't even tell now.

V1OK. Does it look like they've been shot? Have they been stabbed?

V2No, there's, there's a baseball bat and a knife there.

V1And a knife?

V2They're bashed in complete, yes, there's a knife lying on the ground as well.

V1OK. Listen, what I want you to do, is this phone you're on, it's a mobile, is it?

V2It's a mobile, yes.

V1Is it safe for you to go back outside and just check if they are breathing?

V2I'm not going back outside till somebody gets here. I'm not fucking going back outside.

V1No worries.

V2You want to break down the door, fucking go ahead, I'm not fucking going back outside.

V1That's OK, that's all right. They're out there, are they?

V2......

V1Is the person -

V2No, no, no.

V1- is the person who did this out there?

V2No, there's nobody outside, so I, the back door was opened. I closed the back door and I grabbed the bat, and I came back into my room and called you.

V1OK. So the person who did this is not there. All right.

V2......

V1And there's definitely been weapons, there's definitely serious bleeding?

V2Oh, yes.

V1OK. Could you see where the blood was coming from or you just looked and ran outside?

V2There's blood all over the place. I can ......

V1OK. So you don't know at this point if they're still breathing or not?

V2I get, I come, I should've checked, I didn't check, no, I didn't.

V1OK. All right, that's OK. When do you think this happened?

V2It was just, I, I woke up when there was, like, screaming outside and I went outside and, and I waited for a while 'cause I thought the, 'cause I could hear -

V1OK. Listen, that's OK. We've got the ambulance on the way now, OK.

V2Thank you ... 

V1Now listen -

V2.... are you going, are you gunna, are you gunna hang up now?

V1Pardon?

V2Are you gunna hang up or are you gunna stay on?

V1Do you want me to stay on with you?

V2Could you please till somebody gets here, please?

V1Are you worried that somebody is still there?

V2I, I closed the door, so I know, oh, unless he's in one of the other rooms - I don't know, but I've got the bat with me, but there's nothing else, I just pushed my -

V1OK. But you're, listen, let me just get this straight. You're inside the house -

V2I'm inside the house.

V1- and the two people that have been attacked, they're outside the house. Is that correct?

V2Yeah, no, no, they're inside the house too.

V1But you have locked -

V2Yes, they're down the corridor.

V1OK.

V2I, I've myself and I've locked my door, got my cabinet in front of the -

V1You've locked yourself in the room?

V2Yes, I have -

V1And you didn't -

V2- and I grabbed the bat.

V1OK. And you didn't see who was there?

V2What?

V1You didn't see the person who did this?

V2No, I didn't.

V1OK.

V2I should've gone outside earlier, but -

V1OK. I'm going to stay on the phone with you.

V2But shit, oh, fuck.

V1How old are these people, your friends?

V2Um, about 25.

V1Males or females?

V2Both are males. (3 sec pause and moment of silence)

V1OK. So let me just get this straight. You're in the bed, the room of the house, you've locked yourself in.

V2Yes.

V1You were asleep. You woke up and heard them screaming-

V2Screaming, yes.

V1- and you've gone out, and seen them both lying there -

V2Yes.

V1- with a knife and a baseball bat. Is that correct?

V2Yes, and I, I took the baseball bat with me, it's with me right now.

V1OK. OK. (moment of silence) I'm going to stay on the phone with you, OK.

V2Yeah. Why are they taking so long? There's a hospital just down the road.

V1Listen, I know, I understand that, but it's going to depend where the ambulance is, and listen, the ambulance is not going to come in there until the police get there, OK.

V2Yeah. How long are the police gunna take? (5 sec pause)

...

V1Are you there?

V2I'm outside now. They're definitely not breathing.

V1OK. Listen, the ambulance is there in your street, OK.

V2It's on my street, where?

V1The ambulances are there, but they are not coming in till the police get there. 

V2Can I go outside?

...

V1All right. So we're waiting on the police. Now, do you want me to let you go now?

V2Did you find out how long the police are gunna take?

V1It shouldn't be too long. We've explained the urgency of the situation, OK.

V2OK, ah, OK, get um -

V1Listen, you're there with your friends right now. Do you think they are beyond any help or do you want to try and do some first aid?

V2I know -

V1I know it's really hard, but I can give you some advice on what to do.

V2I, I know, I know CPR as well, but there's blood, there's this like, like, there's blood all over his, his, his nose, so I don't even know if I can give him CPR and -

V1OK

V2Um, I'm, I'm, I'm gunna, I'm gunna go outside now.

V1OK. All right. I'll let you go. I'll let you go.

V2OK. OK.""


At the time the appellant says he has gone outside his room, the television can be heard in the background.

84The appellant was spoken to by ambulance officers and police at the scene and gave a brief account of his movements during the day leading to what he claimed to be the discovery of the bodies of his flatmates. 

85Upon leaving the flat by the back door, and going down the stairs and along the side of the house, the appellant met ambulance officers. He appeared to be upset, distressed and bewildered, agitated and breathing heavily. He told one ambulance officer that one of his flatmates was lying on the ground covered in blood frothing at the mouth. He told another in answer to a question as to what he had seen:

""I don't know. I was asleep. I heard a noise. I woke up. I saw lots of blood ... I think I saw a knife.""

86The police arrived. After some short accounts to some of the police, the appellant gave this account to Sergeant Woodward that was recorded in his notebook:

""Sleeping in room. My girlfriend called morning, but went back to sleep. Woke up to the sound of things falling. Thought somebody dropped something, but went back to sleep. Heard somebody run past. The bedroom door was locked from inside. Person who ran past, I think Tony, yelled 'help'. I didn't go out. I should have, but didn't. My room has a damaged fly screen. After heard sound somebody being hit I should have opened door but didn't. The sound lasted 5 minutes. It was all quiet. Some time after, I opened the door. I noticed the door was slightly ajar. I saw to my right my friend Tony was lying next to the front door. His back was against the wall. I saw baseball bat and knife near him. I picked up the bat and went towards the back entrance and saw my other friend lying there, Tay. Closed back door, locked it and took the bat to my bedroom and went in and locked the door. I called 000 on my mobile and they told me to stay in the room and wait. The lady asked me if I knew CPR. I know, but didn't try. She said the ambulance people were outside, but they are not coming in until police arrive. I said I don't see anyone outside, so I went outside with the bat.

...

I saw Tony had froth coming from his mouth and was bleeding from his head. I still had the bat with me. I touched Tony on the neck to see if he was bleeding.

There was blood all over the floor. I put my hands near his nose and felt. He was not breathing. I did not want to do anything else. I went to Tony and touched his neck to see if he was breathing and feel a pulse. He wasn't, so I left the house by the back door. I went outside on the street and saw the ambulance, told them what happened. I waited with the ambulance and spoke to the police"". 

87Importantly, the sequence that the appellant gave Sergeant Woodward accorded with what he told the 000 operator: that he had seen both Tan and Tay before telephoning.

88The appellant voluntarily accompanied police to Maroubra Police Station from the unit and participated in a recorded interview, which extended over some hours. He was also photographed and consented to supplying a buccal swab for DNA testing.

89Relevant parts of the interview in which the appellant explained what had happened were as follows:

""A 65: ... I actually woke up about 6:00 something, my girlfriend called me ... I had a shower and everything and then I went back to bed. [The second time] I, I don't know when exactly this was but I heard, I heard, like the TV was on loud outside and I, I heard, I thought I heard like something drop, I thought it was nothing because nothing, I didn't hear anything after that, and so I went back to bed, I didn't even open my door.

A 66: ... I woke up like for the third, third time I guess today when I heard what I thought was the sound of some sort of commotion, I was half asleep and the TV was on as well so I had no idea what actually was goin' on, and just about getting out of bed when I heard somebody rush past my door, bump along the thing and, and, and I, I think it was Tony, I think he was, I think he screamed help but I'm not exactly sure. A couple of moments, a while later I, I hear what the, the sound of something metal being hit against something and that went, went on for quite, for, for some time and after that it was just quite [sic]. At that point I, I would, I, I chose not to go out, I chose not to go out, and I locked my room door from the inside and I pulled my old cabinet and barricaded myself inside. When I could find my phone I, for some reason I couldn't find my phone, I found my phone, I called, called triple 0, and the lady, they, she was asking me questions ... there was no more sound from outside, I thought OK, OK, now might be a good time, a good time -

...

A 67: - to have a look. I pushed the cabinet thing aside, unlocked my door, had a quick outside [sic], closed the door again, there was, I saw Tony, my friend, laying on the right hand side from my room near the door and there was blood around him .... I went outside, I, the baseball bat and knife were there so I grabbed the baseball bat and, and just put it in front of me and went down to the, to the living room, there was nobody there either.

...

A 68: At that point I hadn't seen my friend Tay 'cause there's, there's like a couch in the living room, the TV was still on and it was real loud, and the couch was there and I saw that the, I saw that the back door was open so I, I thought there might be somebody there so I, so I took the, took, I had the baseball bat, I went, I went back and grabbed the knife and, you know, holding them both I went towards the back, it was, that's when I saw Tay, he was lying behind the couch and was covered in, covered in blood too. And nobody outside near the back so I locked the door ... and went back to my room and the lady on, the emergency operator she, she said, yeah, should like check, check to see if, if they're breathing you know, like try to give them CPR and I went back outside and saw Tony was like, like froth and all this his mouth and, and I checked for his pulse and I tried to shake, shake him, and like there was no response at all. And I went to Tay and did the same thing, there was no response either, he didn't have a pulse. I did not perform CPR or anything. I went back inside, the lady told me to wait till the police were there, she said the ambulance guys were already outside but there [sic] weren't gunna come in until the police were there so after a while she told me, yeah, the police car's there so I, I, I still had the baseball bat with me, I don't know where I left it, I just was carrying it with me just, just in case. And well, yeah, when she said the ambulance guys were there I decided like, yeah, I had to leave the house. I left the house and guys were near the junction of Barker and that street just before the hill.""

It is to be noted that this sequence was at odds with what he had told the ambulance officer on the phone and Sergeant Woodward earlier in the day. Then, he had said (to both) that he saw the two bodies before calling 000. Also, he now refers to picking up the knife, as well as the bat.

90He said he last saw Tay and Tan the evening before at 9.30 or 10.00 pm. He then gave answers to detailed questioning about the day in question: waking up at ""about 6.00, 6.20"" upon the call of his girlfriend (A 316, 317); making arrangements to meet her that afternoon (A 334); having a shower and breakfast, and going back to bed (A 379, 380, 383, 399); being up for about an hour (A 424); later, after sleeping, hearing the sound of the television and something falling, waking him up, but going back to sleep almost immediately (A 438, 444-450); this being, he estimated, at about 8.00 am (A 451, 452).

91This last mentioned occasion of being woken up would, if the appellant were telling the truth, in all likelihood be Mr Tay falling upon being hit. He continued to answer questions about the day: waking up a ""third time"". The questioning included the following, which we will set out verbatim because of the importance of the inconsistencies.

""Q453And then you, you say woke up a third time you heard a sound.

...

Q454Tell me about that.

AOK. Lying in bed and I heard this really loud, a real loud, something, like something big had fallen down. I thought what the hell is this? And I heard some metal thing, I thought someone was picking something up, I thought I may as well go and look just in case somebody smashed the TV, but the TV was still on, so I thought OK. I got out of bed, I was just, just putting away my stuff, 'cause all my clothes were on my bed as usual, but after a while hear somebody run past my room, at that point I was just by my wardrobe putting in my contact lenses, and I hear somebody run past my room and I think it was Tony, I think, I think I, I'm pretty sure he shouted for help. I know it's, people ran towards the front entrance end and I heard, I heard the metal sound like a couple of times, I knew something was wrong.

Q455What metal sound was that?

AI think it's been the baseball bat which I found.

Q456A baseball bat. Now I'll just take you back, you woke up and you heard what somebody run past your door.

A.Mmm Mmm.

Q457Was it loud steps or -

AYes, somebody was running past my door and -

Q458Then -

A- somebody screamed as he run past my door.

Q459Were they running slow or were they -

AHe was running, I, it sounded like a guy's streaking past my door.

A460And where did the sound come from, did it sound it's coming from across the house or where did it --

AIt started from here, the person's ran towards the front entrance.

Q461So you're indicating towards the back of the house?

AI dunno where it started, I'd just say it would be somewhere in the living room, I dunno which end. But it started from there and the person apparently bumped into my door or tried maybe to knock on my door as they ran past, and ran over here. And then I hear the metal sound then.

Q462Metal sound. And you thought, you said it was a baseball bat?

ABase, baseball bat.

Q463What makes you think it was a baseball bat?

ABecause it's aluminium and it was lying right beside where I found Tony.""


92He continued with his recounting of what happened:

""Q496So you woke up a third time, you heard what sounded like, you said it was Tony, he was screaming for help. When you say that what, what do you mean by scream, was it loud, soft, long, short scream, what was it?

ANo, it was just one, what it'd sound like, it was just like a sort of scream, like 'Ahhh' and 'help', and then he bumped or knocked against my door and went running on that side.

Q497Towards the front of the house?

...

Q500- exactly what you can remember. Did, when I say did you hear something, did you hear another person in the unit?

AWell, I heard the thumping of the somebody running along the ground, I don't know, I just don't know how to tell if there was one person or ten, well ten people I would tell but -

Q501Yes.

A- if there two people or three people, I couldn't tell at the point.

Q502Did you hear any argument or anything like that?

ANot beside the thing falling over earlier, I don't think anything else.

Q503OK. And what did you hear then, after you heard Tony run past the door?

AOK.

Q504Or you say you thought it was Tony. What did you hear then?

AWell, I was standing right here and I heard this metal thing going, a couple of times it hit, I think it might have hit the door frame, and when, like, there's a metal, metal thing.

...

Q508All right. And how many times did you hear what sounded like a metal thing hit the door?

AI don't now if it hit the door but I, the door frame ... maybe it hit the door.

Q509The door frame, sorry, you said the door frame.

ANo, I, I don't know exactly what it hit but I, maybe it hit, I dunno, maybe he hit, hit the door knob or something like that.

Q510Which door do you, do you say you think it was hitting? Just -

AIt would either be Tony's or the front entrance.

Q511OK. But you're not sure?

AI'm not sure.

Q512OK. How long did you hear the hitting sound?

AThe hitting sounds.

Q513You said earlier that it went on for a while, and when I spoke to you at Barker Street you said it could have been 5 minutes. Would that be right?

A5 minutes. That's a long time to be hitting. 5 minutes .... I've really no of time at this point.

SENIOR CONSTABLE FREARSON

Q514Try and remember it, try. Take your time if you need to but try and remember it and, and hear it again. Try and relive it to a degree and see, try, just try and think about it, how long did it go for roughly, how many times can you hear it, that you hear this noise?

A'Cause it wasn't continuous, it's not like it was just metal ... it was like it would hit something and stop, hit something and stop, I'm standin' right out, right inside on this side of my door and I'm, at this point there's something wrong, 'cause I heard a yell for help and I didn't go outside.

SENIOR CONSTABLE WOODWARD

Q515Was your door locked still?

AMy door is always locked.

...

Q517OK. Did you hear anybody come to your door?

ATo my door, no.

Q518So when you say the banging, it was banging and then it stopped?

ANo, it was, I don't know how long exactly it was going for but I must have heard it, the bat go down about 10 times, hit, but I don't know if it, but that, it sounded like it was metal but if he was hitting somebody .... So I, I don't, I heard it about 10 times.

...

Q521And so you chose not to go out and you locked the room ... you said at one stage there it went quiet, how long had it been quiet before you unlocked your door to have a look outside?

AThe first thing I did was when I heard him do that and I heard the metal sounds, what I did, ... I grabbed my table and the cabinets underneath and I put it against my door.

...

Q526What were you thinking, what were you thinking -

AI was trying to get me, trying to remember where my phone was to call Triple 0 but for some reason I couldn't find my phone. I, I knew it was on my bed somewhere but, but all my clothes were on this side and I think it just slipped in there after I called my girlfriend, just put it in there. And I didn't want to move away from the door so I just hold, just holding the door.

Q527So how long do you think it passed until you decided to open the door?

AWell, it was quiet for at least 5 minutes before.

Q528And what happened then, Ram?

AWell, I took the cabinet away, pushed it away from the door, I opened the door, like had a quick peek outside and closed it again, didn't hear any footsteps or anything like that.

...

Q541O.K. And that was when you looked to your right, you saw Tony then. What happened then, what did you do then?

AWell, first thing that confirmed my worst fears and I locked the door back again. I put, put, I think I put, I think I put the cabinet back, it's, and I went to go on the bed and started looking for my phone. And I found my phone and that's when I called Triple 0.

...

Q587So, I've just get this, make sure I'm correct. Earlier you told me that you saw the baseball bat and knife near him, picked up the bat and went towards the back entrance. Is that -

AThat was after.

Q588That's after you were -

AAfter, after, because, I, when I first saw it I went right back inside but then the lady told me to go and check for their like -

Q589Right.

A- just to see if I can perform CPR and stuff like that. And I went, so I went outside, that's when I took the bat, and then I -

Q590No, that's OK. I've just got written what you told me, you picked up the bat and went towards the back entrance and you saw my other friend lying there, Tony.

A.No, Tay.

Q591Tay.

ATay was lying there.

Q592You, you closed the back door, locked it, and took the bat back to my bedroom went in and locked the door. I called Triple 0 on my mobile. But -

ANo, I didn't, I called Triple 0 first, she asked me to leave, she asked me to check on them.

Q593So you didn't go down to the back of the room?

ANo, I didn't go down until she asked me to.

Q594OK.

ASorry.

Q595So you've picked up, you've looked at the bat -

AYeah.

Q596- you've gone back inside, locked the door and then you've Triple 0. What's happened then?

AThe lady says that, she asked me like my particulars and stuff like that, my address and all, and she says, she says, do you know if, if they're still, they're still breathing? And I said, she said, if you want to perform CPR I can teach you how to do it. I said, I know how to perform CPR but I, there might still be somebody outside so I don't want to go out yet. She said, OK, you stay in your room. And she said they're getting the police and the ambulance people .... After I spoke to her and I realised everything was quiet outside I took another look, went straight for this and grabbed the knife and the baseball bat ... and, and I just made sure nobody was here and then went back and I locked the door, was locking the door and that's when I found Tay on this side.

...

Q59820 minutes before everybody arrived. You didn't have the bat at that stage when you called Triple 0?

A.No, I didn't.

Q599OK. So when you've called Triple 0 and she said, do you know CPR? So you went out to check on Tony?

AI, I actually made sure nobody was inside, nobodoy's still in there so, I didn't want to go back here without anything so I grabbed -"".


93This sequence was contrary to what he told the ambulance officer and Sergeant Woodward earlier in the day, as to when he saw Mr Tay and when he picked up the baseball bat.

94The questioning continued:

""Q632Did you notice anything else about the living room?

AThat's when I, I closed the door and I, with the ball and, baseball bat and the knife I went back towards the front entrance and the lady, the lady to see if like they had CPR, if I could perform CPR but I went up to Tay and went up to Tony and when, when I got, when I got to him like went down on my knees and I, I was just like, I think I put the knife down that I had, like the baseball bat's still in my hands, and like I didn't want to face him entirely so I was like sitting this way so I could look down the corridor as well, and I had the baseball bat still in my hands.
Q633Yes.

AAnd like I, I, I wanted to check to see if there was a pulse so I put my hand like on his neck to check for his carotid pulse and when I -

Q634When you say you put his hand on his neck, can you just show just for the camera what exactly, which fingers and that did you use?
AI think I've gone like that.""

95Although the transcript of this interview does not contain a reference to Mr Tan expirating blood by coughing, there is a point in the interview shortly after the last exchange that was broken by an interruption in the recording by a change of tape (Q660 and following) where it appears that the appellant may have been about to explain the expiration, but was cut off. The following exchange is recorded:


""Q660Yes. How, how, how do you think you got all that blood on you there?

A.'Cause I tried to put his head back, 'cause he was, he was ---

Q661That's O.K., put your jumper on and ---

A.He ...

Q662Take a seat.

A.I ---

Q663How did you, yes, continue how you were ---

A.When I went up to him and I'm, I'm looking that way so that I can (TAPE BEEPING) see anybody who comes down.""


96The interviewer (Sergeant Woodward) did not return to the topic. Sergeant Woodward recognised in his evidence that he could or should have gone back to this topic. This can be seen as important for at least two reasons. First, it lessens the impact of the proposition of the Crown at the trial that the version of the coughing was made up as a recent invention to account innocently for Mr Tan's blood on his feet and ankles. Secondly, it casts the Crown's submissions on appeal into some relief. By the Crown embracing the expirated blood as the product of a reflex cough after washing off Tan's blood transferred during the assault, implicitly it was far more likely that the appellant would refer to this fact earlier in his accounts to police, rather than later. Indeed, it would likely be one of the first things the appellant would have said were he to have planned the killing and then washed off Mr Tan's blood so carefully, only to leave expirated blood photographed by police. It would have been of prime importance to explain how this blood came to be on him.

97On 18 September 2003 the appellant voluntarily participated in a further video recorded interview at the unit where he ""walked through"" the events of 15 September under questioning by police. That evidence was summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in the earlier appeal judgment at [32] and [114]-[116] as follows:

""[32] A walkthrough was also conducted with the appellant during which the following exchange occurred: 

'Q: OK. That's fine. OK You've picked up the bat and the knife. Now, you're on the phone?A: That's right.
Q: Which hand are you holding the phone in?A: I think it was the same hand as the knife.
Q: OK. So you've got the phone in your hand with the knife. OK. You were still talking on the phone?A: There was times I was talking and there was times I wasn't ... And this, this, like I said, I thought I'd missed out certain things the other day when I speaking to ..., like, when I was, I was right beside [Tony] ... Like, a spurt of blood came out of his nose and mouth ... And he's spasmed.

...

A: But I was actually leaning down beside him ... That's when I saw the blood sort of spasm ... And blood came out the front.

...

Q: Now, just to clarify, you said that blood came out of his nose. Now, was -
A: It was just, like, it was like froth ... And, and he sort of spasmed ... And that made me take a step back.'

....

[114] ... During the walkthrough on 18 September 2003 the appellant raised the possibility of Tan expirating blood when he said 'like, when I was, I was right beside him... like, a spurt of blood came out of his nose and mouth ... and he spasmed.' The appellant described how he was leaning down beside Tan's body and said 'that's when I saw the blood, saw the spasm ... and blood came out from the front ... and that's when I, like, took a step back and all the time I was, just looking up this way, just in case somebody's surprised me.' 

[115] Later when asked by the police to clarify what he said about blood coming out of Tan's nose the appellant said 'it was just, like, it was like froth ... and he sort of spasmed ... and that made me take a step back ... just, no, I didn't expect that it would spurt ...' 

[116] At this point the appellant (who apparently appeared reluctant to approach the site of where Tan's body had been located) at the request of the police endeavoured to direct Sgt Davis to assume a position where he (the appellant) was at the time of the spasm or spurt. The demonstration led to Sgt Davis squatting beside the assumed location of Tan's body with his left foot closest to the body. The photographic evidence showed more blood on the appellant's left foot than on his right.""

98During significant parts of the walkthrough video, the appellant appeared hesitant and unable to give coherent, clear answers under questioning. At times he expressed a difficulty recalling the precise sequence of events. This was important because at both the interview at the police station on the evening of 15 September and during the discussion in the ""walkthrough"" of 18 September, the appellant said that he did not see Mr Tay dead until after he had made the 000 call. That is, he said, he went out of his room after the noise ceased, saw Mr Tan, picked up the bat and knife, returned to his room and called 000. Of course, his call to 000 revealed that he knew of two deaths not one. Thus, the question was whether he was honestly confused about sequence (which he said he was on a number of occasions) in connection with the discovery of shocking and traumatic murders or carelessly dishonest in the telling of falsehoods.

99There were a number of parts of the appellant's account and the manner in which it was told in the ""walkthrough"" which the jury could well have thought either implausible or reflecting badly on his version of events, such as the description of holding the knife while checking for Mr Tay's pulse, the long pauses sometimes made in evident difficulty in fixing sequence and the inconsistencies in sequence. We have taken into account that a jury could have taken that view as part of seeing and hearing all the evidence in context. Notwithstanding that, and taking it into account, we are still left with a doubt as to the verdicts. We have not ourselves taken our own impressions of the appellant's attitude and demeanour in the walkthrough into account. In respect of this evidence, we note the caution referred to by French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at 410-411 [29]-[31] in an appeal court viewing a video recording of a complainant's evidence. Similar caution is appropriate here about drawing any adverse inference from the impression created by the video recording of the ""walkthrough"". The need for caution is reinforced because we cannot say that we all had the same impression of the ""walkthrough"".

100At this point, an observation should be made that is important to our ultimate view as to the existence of a reasonable doubt as to guilt. The trial, and, to a degree, most of the submissions on appeal, can be seen to have been conducted in almost a binary fashion. The Crown case theory included: a motive (perhaps weak for such horrific crimes), opportunity, the purchase of the murder weapon, and the appellant's account being in some respects implausible and recounted with inconsistencies. The defence case, which accepted that the appellant was present when the deceased were killed, relied upon his version of sleeping through the first murder, being awakened by the second but fearful to go out, and then finding his flatmates murdered by unknown assailants being reasonably possible.

101There may be a tendency, in such circumstances, if there are aspects of the appellant's account that are implausible or difficult to accept, to fall back on the Crown case theory as the balance of the (binary) universe of discourse. On appeal, the Crown, perfectly correctly, accepted that inconsistencies in the version relied upon by the appellant or difficulty in accepting his account as truthful in all respects did not by default permit a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It was still necessary for the Crown to negative beyond reasonable doubt any rational hypothesis consistent with innocence said to be open on the evidence.

102The appellant participated voluntarily in a further recorded interview on 28 May 2004 at the conclusion of which he was charged with the murder of Mr Tay and Mr Tan.

The crime scene

103A detailed plan and a comprehensive set of crime scene photographs was tendered at trial showing the configuration of the rooms in the unit and the location of the bodies of the deceased. On the appeal, that plan was colour coded to highlight the deposits of the blood of Tan and Tay and the location of five fingerprints not able to be identified from the database and one not suitable for identification purposes. Other fingerprints were identified as those of the appellant and the deceased and people known to be associated with them. The baseball bat and the knife were examined but no prints with sufficient detail for identification purposes were able to be recovered.

104A helpful summary of the evidence of the crime scene and the likely methods of the attacks is found in [21]-[26] of the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL:

""[21] A bloodstain was detected on the lower eastern wall and there was evidence of Tay's head having been in contact with the wall. There was blood staining around a computer located on a desk which included clotted blood and what was determined to be medium velocity blood impact spatter. This led Detective Elliott, a crime scene examiner, to conclude that there had been an initial assault near the lower eastern wall, then after a short while there was some movement and a secondary assault took place near the computer. 

[22] On and in front of the lounge were bloodstains, small pieces of glass, glasses frames, and shattered teeth. From the trail of blood staining associated with Tan's body Detective Elliott concluded that the initial assault on Tan was in the lounge room where he was struck in the face, then moved into the hallway where a further assault took place. Tan was lying on his back with his head beside the front door and facing left towards it. The front door was closed but unlocked. There was a black handled kitchen knife under Tan's left knee. There was evidence of medium velocity blood staining radiating from Tan's head and also medium velocity blood staining on the floor around his body, on his clothing and upper feet. Detective Elliott concluded that this blood staining was a result of the impact on Tan's head from the weapon used. There were three knife wounds to Tan's neck. 

[23] Detective Elliott inspected the kitchen sink and the bathroom. He found no signs that they had been used in an attempt to wash or remove blood from the appellant or his clothing. He conducted a presumptive test for blood in the bathroom, obtaining a weak positive on the hot water tap and a strong positive on the hand basin. However, Detective Elliott explained that these tests did not confirm the presence of blood. The substances identified may have been rust or some other material. 

[24] Detective Elliott examined the clothing the appellant had been wearing when he exited the flat. There were faint stains which tested positive to a presumptive blood test on the front, rear, inside front, and inside right cuff of the appellant's long sleeved top. These stains were consistent with transfer stains, which could have come from the appellant's bare skin. There was no blood staining on the top that the detective could relate to the assault. He observed that it is the nature of using a weapon such as a baseball bat with a wide end that it allows blood to be projected in areas away from the bat and the assailant could be somewhat protected due to the shape of the bat. However, he said he would have expected some blood stain spatter on the assailant. 

[25] Detective Elliott also examined the shorts which the appellant had been wearing. He found a number of stains, three of which were later confirmed to be human blood, and which he said were consistent with medium velocity blood spatter. 

[26] Blood smears were detected on the appellant's hands together with blood spots on his feet and ankles. The blood spots ranged in diameter from 1 to 3 mm.""


The reasons why we concluded that there was a reasonable doubt not resolved by any advantage of the jury

105We examined the whole of the evidence available to the jury. We considered counsel's submissions written and oral. We discussed at length all aspects of the evidence.

106Our individual views about aspects of the evidence varied in emphasis; but we all reached the clear view that there was a reasonable doubt about the appellant being the murderer of Mr Tay and Mr Tan.

107Whilst Mr Tay and Mr Tan were fatally assaulted some two hours apart, it was no part of the trial that their killings were unrelated. Indeed, it was the Crown case supported by medical evidence that the appellant stabbed Mr Tay in the neck at or about the time he killed Mr Tan to ensure that he was dead.

108Aspects of the appellant's account to police were difficult to accept. First, sleeping through Mr Tay's murder by the unknown assailant or assailants beyond waking up at a fall and going back to sleep strikes at least one of us as implausible. Yet, people can and do sleep through noise. Secondly, the response of the appellant to the sound of Mr Tan being attacked is problematic. While on his account he is unaware of the assault, his friend does call for help and he does hear sounds of hitting. It is difficult to understand why he would not at least investigate if he had no inkling of the ferocity of the horrific attack that was occurring. Thirdly, there are the inconsistencies in his accounts to 000 and the police as to when he came out of his room and found Tan and Tay brutally bashed and bloodied. Such inconsistencies may, however, be explicable by the shock of being exposed to the battered corpses of his friends. Fourthly, the inconsistencies as to when he picked up the bat and the knife and the implausibility of his claim to have examined Tay to see whether he was alive with both weapons in his hand (and not having any of Tay's blood transferred to him in the process). Fifthly, his hesitancy in recounting events as he assisted police in the walkthrough. Again, however, this may be explicable by reliving, and striving for precision in the recall of, an horrific experience. Sixthly, the fact that his keys were in the door of his room, on the hallway side, easily visible to the assailants.

109Why then did (and do) we have a doubt about his guilt? One hypothesis that in our view is available on the facts is the murder of both Tay and Tan by others, for reasons that are unknown but about which the appellant may have had some knowledge. On that hypothesis he was not liable for their murder as the person who physically did the acts causing death, though questions of complicity or misprision may arise. This might give rise to his fear and hysteria, both at the time and later (and in that way explain why he barricaded himself in his bedroom), about brutal killers able to deal with him as they dealt with Tay and Tan. The commission of the murders by others of whom the appellant had knowledge may explain both the inconsistencies in his accounts on material matters and the difficulty he had in communicating clearly the sequence of events in the walkthrough. It would also explain the level of intense emotion and hysteria in his voice in the 000 call and the evident distress during the walkthrough.

110The evidence supporting this hypothesis is as follows. Both Mr Tay and Mr Tan behave unusually on the day they were murdered. Mr Tay misses a lecture-something he never does. The Crown says he remains at the unit to confront the appellant over the debt. The question that immediately presents is why he would interrupt his lectures when he could see and talk to the appellant at any time and in the presence of Mr Tan, his ally on the issue? One reasonable competing hypothesis is that he was expecting someone.

111Mr Tan goes to class, but he is unusually late. He seems pre-occupied and not himself; he has just left Mr Tay in the unit. He is not so distracted that he does not attend class, so it can be comfortably inferred that he has not witnessed the brutal bludgeoning of Mr Tay. Something, however, appears to pre-occupy him. Further, both Mr Tay and Mr Tan have something to do or someone to meet after the lecture. This can be reasonably inferred from Mr Tan's late cancellation of the preparation for the ethics seminar with Mr Teo that he and Mr Tay were to share that afternoon. After his lecture, Mr Tan met three people who were waiting in a car for him at the exit from the university and left with them. His home was only a few hundred metres away. These people undoubtedly drove him to his unit. Once inside he begins to cook a meal that is consistent with food for a number of people. 

112The above hypothesis, based on facts that are tolerably certain, raises the real possibility that another or others who could have been the killer or killers of Mr Tay returned to the unit with Mr Tan intent on killing him.

113There was evidence that Mr Tan some weeks before had bought a baseball bat ""for protection"". A second bat was not found at the crime scene. It was common ground that the murder weapon that was found in the flat was purchased by the appellant. Accepting that Mr Tan's blood may have masked the blood of Tay on the knife and bat, and that Ms Dusting's evidence supported the conclusion (albeit weakly) that the same bat was used to bludgeon both men, nevertheless there was some evidence of a second bat, that may have been used on Mr Tay and removed.

114The people in the car did not come forward to assist police. There was evidence of media coverage of the murders and of police wishing to speak to the people in the car. They were, on the Crown case, the last people (other than the appellant as killer) to see Mr Tan alive. They had waited to pick him up by apparent pre-arrangement to drive him a few hundred metres. In all the circumstances, including the unusual behaviour of both Tay and Tan, there is a reasonable possibility that these people (or one or more of them) had a connection with the re-arrangements of the usual pattern of Tay's and Tan's day and had organised to meet Tan after his lecture when, unbeknownst to him, they had killed Tay and were driving Tan to the unit where he would also be killed. 

115The evidence does not reveal why one or more of these people would want Tay or Tan killed. This does not appear to have been random violence. At the trial and on appeal, counsel for the appellant posited the incipient affair between Mr Tay and Jasmine Tan as a possible motive. That is possible, but it is not compelling. Accordingly, the reason for the brutal, ruthless and cold-blooded murder of two diligent and quiet-mannered students is unexplained. On this hypothesis the killings were effected by persons capable of exciting the greatest of fear in an individual who had any knowledge of the occurrence of the act and of their identity.

116Thus, the reasonable hypothesis of the presence of others is real. The hypothesis that the appellant was not the murderer of Tay and Tan is strengthened by the dearth of forensic evidence to link him to either killing.

117None of the blood found on the appellant or his clothes was that of Mr Tay. True it is that he had two hours to clean himself of any blood from Mr Tay's bashing; but the evidence did reveal that the killer stabbed Mr Tay in the neck around the time of (presumably before) the bludgeoning of Mr Tan.

118More importantly, there is the dearth of blood of Mr Tan. This was of critical importance in evaluating the reasonableness of the alternative hypothesis. We have already described how the controversy about this was played out at trial and how the Crown dealt with the matter on appeal. For ease of comprehension it is necessary to restate parts of what we have already said. We would say, at the outset, however, that the approach of the Crown on appeal to holding the verdicts was both robustly realistic and powerfully argued. In significant part because of the clarity of the distillation of the issues by the Crown on appeal, we were able to concentrate on the evidence that was essential to the existence or not of a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt. That did not detract from the need for a careful and thorough examination of all of the evidence, but it enabled the Court to focus its enquiry, for which the Court was, and is, grateful. 

119There was little blood on the appellant who, on the Crown case, had just bludgeoned Mr Tan repeatedly adjacent to the front door, having begun his attack in the living room and having chased him up the hallway. The distribution of blood was neither limited nor uni-directional. Sergeant Elliott reasoned that it was possible that notwithstanding the ferocity and violence of the attack, the relatively small amount of blood on the appellant was the result of chance. The Crown accepted, however, that whilst that was possible, one would have expected to see more of Tan's blood on the appellant had he wielded the bat in the ferocious attack reflected in the range of the blood spatter and distribution of his head injuries. Then, of course, there was the appellant's account that Tan had expirated blood by a reflex cough as he leant or crouched down to check his pulse. We have referred to the conflict in the expert evidence about this, from which we accept that such a reflex cough from a dying man is possible. At the trial the Crown strenuously resisted it as the explanation for the blood on the appellant. There was said to be a late invention of it at the walkthrough on 18 September. But, as we have already said, the appellant may have been coming to it at one point in the first interview on the evening of 15 September. There is a reasonable possibility that some or a good proportion of the blood on the appellant was expirated blood from a cough by Mr Tan. In these circumstances there was even less blood spattered on him from the ferocious attack. It was the dearth of forensic evidence and the reasonable possibility that Mr Tan coughed or expirated blood on to the appellant that on appeal the Crown had squarely to confront. It did so by embracing what had been substantially resisted below - by accepting that Mr Tan coughed over the appellant while he was speaking to the ambulance operator and that the reason that there was so little other blood on him was that he had washed himself before calling 000. This would require (in order for there to be no blood-spattered clothes) that the murder of Mr Tan was undertaken naked. Having washed and dried himself, he rang 000 and, while going through the charade of checking for a carotid pulse, Tan coughed and expirated blood on him. It was too late to wash again; he had already called for police and ambulance. 

120This hypothesis is possible. There are, however, difficulties with it. First, the bathroom where this washing must have taken place was inspected by 4.00 pm on the day. Sergeant Elliott, the experienced crime scene investigator who got to the scene at about 3.35 pm, examined the bathroom ""closely ... as an obvious place where someone may have attempted ... to wash or remove blood from their person or clothing"" (T 905). He inspected the tiles, the wall tiles, the grouting on the floor. There was nothing visible to suggest that the bathroom had been used for that purpose (T 905). He saw no evidence of someone seeking to clean him- or herself of blood in the bathroom. Nevertheless, he still took a number of swabs of various places and sent them for further testing. No inculpatory evidence was tendered from swabs from the bath, bathroom walls or floor.

121Secondly, if, contrary to the view contemporaneously formed by Sergeant Elliott, the bathroom had been used by the appellant to wash himself, he would have had carefully to dry the bathroom surfaces and himself. This would have required clothing or a towel which would have been wet. No such wet clothes or towel were or was placed into evidence.

122Thirdly, though there was a positive result for blood in the bathroom sink, it was presumptive only. Ms Friedman, a forensic biologist, tested the swab from the basin. The positive presumptive did not prove that the sample was blood. Other substances give a positive result. The screening test for blood that would have proved whether it was or was not blood was not undertaken because of the smallness of the sample. Further, the stain from which the swab was taken was ""greyish"" rather than a red-brown stain. She accepted that the swab might not be blood, but a combination of DNA from a source other than blood. There was no reliable evidence of blood in the basin. The DNA of all three in the waste of the basin was consistent with the three men living there.

123Fourthly, there is the timing of this cleaning. Having just bludgeoned and stabbed Mr Tan in a violent and ferocious attack, this careful and cold-blooded murderer must carefully and thoroughly wash and dry not only himself, but also the bathroom. Sloppy or careless work will see him undone. The killing was in all likelihood done sometime after 2.05 pm, possibly after 2.10 pm. By 2.20 or 2.21 pm he has called 000. Not only is this barely enough time to undertake the task of despatching Mr Tan, washing and drying himself and washing and drying the bathroom, but it raises the question why he would place himself under such time pressure. There was no need to call 000 at 2.20 or 2.21 pm. The importance of the cleaning task for exculpation would logically have dictated (to such a careful planner, on this hypothesis) some further delay of the call.

124Fifthly, there is the circumstance of when the appellant raised the fact of the coughing or expiration of the blood by Mr Tan. At the trial this was resisted. His version of it was said to be late invention. Now embraced by the Crown, the expiration of blood poses another difficulty. If the appellant had methodically planned and effected the killing, including the thorough washing and drying of himself and the bathroom in such quick time, he would have been partially foiled by the inconvenience of the near dead Mr Tan coughing blood over him while he held the phone faking concern over whether his victim had a pulse. One would have thought, in these circumstances, that the explanation of the expiration of the blood would have been given very early in his explanations, in all likelihood to Sergeant Woodward in the afternoon outside the unit, or clearly at the interview that evening (even if he was interrupted).

125Sixthly, there are aspects to the 000 call that tell in favour of innocence. Whilst emotion can be faked, of course, the tone, verging on hysteria, of the appellant when he was transferred resonated with fear. Further, he asked to remain on the line with the ambulance officer until the ambulance or police arrived, in a tone of residual fear and distress. This would not appear to be the action of someone who has methodically planned and effected the execution of both Tay and Tan.

126There is considerable suspicion about the events of 15 September 2003, and about the appellant's version of events, both as to its content and tone and manner of expression, especially in the walkthrough. There are matters unexplained.

127Nevertheless, the two bodies of evidence - concerning the existence of the three people in the car picking up Mr Tan and the dearth of connecting forensic material linking the appellant to the death of either, especially Mr Tan, raise in all our minds a reasonable doubt.

128That doubt was, and is, not one which could be resolved by any advantage the jury had in seeing and hearing the evidence at trial.

129The hypothesis upon which the doubt is founded also goes some way to explain and ameliorate some of the problems with the appellant's accounts. He may not have been entirely accurate or complete in his explanations. He may have had a greater degree of knowledge than his explanations revealed, or even some complicity in the murders. If, however, as is a reasonable hypothesis, others known to him murdered Tay and Tan, his circumstances and attitude and ability to recount matters would be partly driven by fear of consequences to him. This was not his version of events, but in our view the confluence of the likely presence of other persons and the dearth of forensic evidence connecting him to the murders gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to him being the murderer.

Ground 1

130The above conclusions make it strictly unnecessary to deal with this ground. The above assumes that Ms Dusting's evidence was admissible.

131The trial judge summarised counsel's argument as to s 137 at [7]-[8] of his reasons, as follows:

""[7]Senior Counsel for the Accused submits that the evidence does not really extend beyond a similarity in black paint as between the three surfaces in question, that the Crown can advance a submission to the jury without this evidence and that the jury could conclude from their own observations a similarity in the three surfaces, namely the bat and the two points on the wall. It is submitted that unfair prejudice would flow to the Accused because, if this evidence is given through Ms Dusting as expert evidence, it would elevate the significance of the evidence.

[8]The forensic and scientific evidence already before the jury has demonstrated, at various points, degrees of inconclusiveness, uncertainty and certainty with respect to forensic testing. The jury will have a range of evidence before them which would leave them in the position where a number of issues cannot be demonstrated to a level of scientific certainty, one way or the other.""

132The trial judge's reasons were set out at [11]-[14] of his reasons, as follows:

""[11]The unfair prejudice to the Accused which is claimed, in my view, is not sustained. It is capable of being prejudicial to the Accused, of course, in the sense that all evidence tendered in a criminal trial which may tend to implicate an Accused is prejudicial. The question is whether it is unfairly prejudicial.

[12]There are qualifications on the evidence of Ms Dusting which appear to flow essentially from her inability to obtain a two-way transfer. No doubt the issues raised by Ms Dusting's evidence may be explored in evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination.

[13]I am not persuaded that this evidence gives rise to any unfair prejudice to the Accused. I am satisfied that it is probative. I am not persuaded that the fact that the evidence is adduced through an expert witness constitutes a form of unfair prejudice. The evidence is relevant to a fact in issue in the trial. It is probative, and its limitations may be explored before the jury in a way which will leave the jury with this evidence, to be taken into account with the totality of the other evidence, for the purposes of their deliberations as to whether this Accused is guilty of the murder of Tan and Tay.

[14]I propose to allow the evidence.""

133It is to be recognised that there was no complaint about how the trial judge directed the jury in the use of this evidence.

134The evidence was not weighty or probative to a high degree, but in a circumstantial case it was some evidence which could be viewed and weighed with all the other evidence. Any misuse of it beyond the terms of Ms Dusting's evidence was open to be prevented by proper directions, which were given.

135Not only do we perceive no error in approach of the trial judge, we agree with his evaluation of the considerations attending the ruling. In these circumstances it is unnecessary for us to add to the jurisprudence on the proper test for appellate evaluation of rulings under s 137.

136These were and are our reasons for the orders made on 26 July 2012.

2760063,R v Parker [2012] NSWDC 259,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The matter of Todd Parker ultimately comes down to whether Mr Parker should be entitled to have a conviction entered in his absence annulled, but it is a rather complicated matter involving a great deal of confusion. Ultimately, however, it comes down to an interpretation of s 8(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.

2The magistrate who dismissed Mr Parker's application on 25 May 2012 implicitly prefers one view of that, but I prefer another. 

3A brief history of this matter is as follows. Mr Parker was charged. He was late getting to court when his matter was listed for hearing, but not unreasonably so. When his matter was called on, however, it appears that he was in conference with the duty barrister and so neither he nor the duty barrister heard his name being called. In those circumstances the magistrate dealing with the matter that day quite appropriately formed the view that Mr Parker had simply not turned up at court and convicted him in his absence. Thereafter matters went awry. 

4Of particular importance to Deputy Chief Magistrate Mottley was this circumstance, Mr Parker made a s 4 application but then withdrew it, apparently upon receiving indication from the prosecutor that he was unlikely to receive a custodial sentence. He then requested the matter proceed to sentence and much to his surprise, no doubt, he did receive a custodial sentence. It was in those circumstances that Mr Parker made a further application under s 4, that being the one being dismissed by Deputy Chief Magistrate Mottley on 25 May. 

5Of course that further application could only be made with the leave of the Court. It is not entirely clear whether that leave was granted, but the order made by her Honour was to refuse ""this application."" I take that to be the s 4 application and it is, therefore, implicit in that that her Honour had granted leave to Mr Parker to make that application. Thus what is the subject of appeal to this court is not an order refusing leave to bring the application, but an order refusing the application itself.

6The starting point to unravel this mess, (and I confess it is a mess that I may have had some part in causing), is to turn to the legislation. Section 8(2)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides that the Local Court must grant an application for annulment made by the defendant if it is satisfied that the defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings. 

7The matter before Deputy Chief Magistrate Mottley proceeded on the basis that Mr Parker would have no hope in the world of bringing himself under that subsection and so the only criteria considered in the Local Court was that to be found in subs (c) which requires a consideration of the interests of justice. For that her Honour considered the circumstances in which the s 4 application, the first one, was withdrawn and quite appropriately held that mere disappointment in a sentence is not justification for annulling a conviction. However, as I began these remarks, my interpretation of subs (b) is different to her Honour's. In the course of discussions with the lawyer then appearing for Mr Parker on 25 May her Honour went through the criteria. Under s (a) she noted that he failed the criteria in subs (a) and no one has suggested that her Honour was wrong to make that finding. But she then read out subs (b) and said, ""He fails on that one because he filed his s 4"". Thus her Honour has found that Mr Parker was not hindered from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings because he did take action in relation to those original Local Court proceedings when he filed the first s 4 application. However, despite the width of those words ""taking action"", in my view a person making a s 4 application is not for purposes of that section taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings, otherwise everyone who made a s 4 application would be automatically disqualified from bringing themselves under subs (b). The only proper way of interpreting s 8(2)(b) is to consider that ""taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings"" means defending the original Local Court proceedings or taking some other action in relation to those proceedings such as appearing on sentence.

8Thus I accept Mr Healy's basic submission to me. I do not mean that it is basic in the sense that it is not a clever one. I accept Mr Healy's submission to me as to the fundamental nature of the question I have to decide and that is, that I should look at the situation that presented itself when Mr Parker, at the Local Court, had his matter called but did not hear it being called. In my view that circumstance clearly satisfies the description as being a misadventure which prevented him from there and then going into the courtroom and defending the matter. What occurred thereafter would be relevant to questions regarding the interests of justice, but subsequent events are not relevant to the question as to whether misadventure prevented Mr Parker defending the matter, as he wished to, in the original Local Court proceedings.

9In my view, with the greatest of respect, the Deputy Chief Magistrate has focused on the wrong issue in determining the s 4 application made to her. For those reasons I grant the application and remit the matter to the Local Court for hearing.

		05 March 2013",2012-09-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760073,"R v DONAI, Terry Mark [2012] NSWSC 1102","REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1The offender, Terry Mark Donai, has been found guilty at trial of the murder of a married couple, Pamela and William Weightman, at their home at Glen Alpine on 8 January 2000.  He stands for sentence for those crimes.
2His accomplice in the murders was the couple's adopted son, David Weightman.  The investigation of the matter and the subsequent court proceedings have been protracted, but it is not necessary to examine that process.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that David Weightman pleaded guilty to the murders in October 2005 and was sentenced by me on 23 December 2005: R v Weightman [2005] NSWSC 1354.  The trial of the present offender before me was a retrial.  He had been found guilty of the murders in a trial before Fullerton J in 2007, but those convictions were set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal and a new trial was ordered: Donai v R [2011] NSWCCA 173.  Following that earlier trial, Fullerton J had sentenced the offender to life imprisonment for each offence: R v Donai [2008] NSWSC 502.  The course of the investigation and the history of the proceedings can be gleaned from her Honour's remarks on sentence and my own remarks in sentencing David Weightman.
Facts
3When I sentenced David Weightman I recounted the facts of the offences as they had been presented to me.  Fullerton J recorded her findings of fact when she sentenced this offender after the first trial.  However, for present purposes the facts emerge from the evidence of David Weightman in the trial over which I presided, and it is from that evidence that I must find the facts for the purpose of sentence.  The jury's verdicts convey that they accepted David Weightman on essential matters, but it does not follow that I must accept the whole of his account.  Certain aspects of it remain in dispute on the question of sentence, and I shall deal with that matter later.
4David Weightman was 20 years old at the time of the murders.  His parents had adopted him in his infancy.  They were well off, and he expected to be the beneficiary of a substantial estate when they died.  The offender was 32 years old at the time of the offences.  David Weightman had met him a few months previously and they had become friends.  He became acquainted with Mr and Mrs Weightman shortly before the killings, when he undertook some stencilcreting work on the driveway at their home.
5According to David Weightman, a week or so before the murders he was talking to the offender about the estate he stood to inherit on the death of his parents.  In a later conversation, he said, the offender told him that he would kill Mr and Mrs Weightman if David Weightman would provide him with the money to purchase a particular make of motorbike which he wanted.  The price of that bike, an amount of $17,000, was to be his reward.  None of this is conceded for the purpose of sentence.
6David Weightman gave evidence that it was the offender who determined how the killings were to be carried out and how their bodies were to be disposed of.  This, he said, was done as they were travelling to the Weightmans' home on the night they were to be killed.  He said that the offender had some tablets which he understood to be Serapax and which he, David Weightman, was to put in his parents' tea or coffee.  Their having been sedated, the offender was to enter the house and asphyxiate them with a pillow.  They would then be placed in a car and driven over an embankment, to make it look as though they had been killed in an accident.  The use of sedatives, said David Weightman, was consistent with his having earlier told the offender that he did not want his parents to feel any pain.  All this, also, is in dispute in the sentence proceedings.
7David Weightman's evidence was that, upon arriving at the house, he went inside while the offender remained outside.  He made tea for his parents and put the tablets which the offender had given to him into it.  His mother went upstairs to her bedroom, while his father remained on a couch in the lounge room.  He went outside and told the offender that he had given them the drugs, and that his mother had gone upstairs.  Here again, the evidence about drugging the tea is disputed.  
8What then ensued, however, is not in dispute for the purpose of sentence.  The offender entered the house.  He went to the upstairs bedroom, where he asphyxiated Mrs Weightman with a pillow.  She resisted and David Weightman, who was outside the house, heard her scream.  The offender came outside, perspiring, and said to David Weightman, ""That took a lot out of me, I'll need a hand with your dad.""
9The two of them entered the house and went to the couch on which Mr Weightman was dozing.  David Weightman held his father around the waist while the offender placed a pillow over his face.  Mr Weightman put up a considerable struggle, shouting, ""You bastards"", and he fell to the floor.  David Weightman held his arms down and lay across his father's chest to secure him while the offender asphyxiated him.  This process took some minutes.
10Post-mortem examination of Mr Weightman revealed bilateral fractures of the thyroid cartilage.  A medical witness gave evidence that this pointed to manual strangulation.  The Crown prosecutor raised this matter in the sentence proceedings, but it was the evidence of David Weightman, and had been the Crown case, that his father was killed by suffocation.  It seems to me that little turns upon this issue.  Given the circumstances of the killing of Mr Weightman which I have described, the offender's culpability would be the same whether death was occasioned by strangulation, suffocation or both.
11The two of them carried the deceased out of the house and placed them into the father's car, a Mitsubishi Magna.  The offender drove that car to an area off Heathcote Road, and David Weightman followed in his mother's Hyundai.  There the body of Mr Weightman was moved from the rear of the Magna into the driver's seat, his wife's body being in the front passenger seat.  David Weightman and the offender pushed the car over an embankment, and it came to rest against a tree on the slope below.  
12David Weightman later inherited the estate, which was of a value of about $800,000.    He enjoyed its fruits, realising the major assets and buying a home for himself.
Subjective case
13The offender is now 45 years old.  He has a minor criminal history which is of no significance for present purposes.  It should be noted, however, that there are no entries for offences of violence.  He has been in custody since his arrest on 16 June 2006.  
14His background is to be found in a psychiatric assessment of Dr Richard Furst and a statement by his mother, Anne Donai, who gave evidence at the trial and who was accepted by both parties to be a reliable witness.  Subject to one matter to which I shall refer, his upbringing appears to have been unremarkable and he enjoyed a supportive family environment.  He left school at the end of year 9 and, it seems, maintained a good employment record thereafter.  
15He has been in several intimate relationships, the first producing a son, Shannon, who is now 24 years old, and the last producing another son, who is now 7.  After the breakdown of the first relationship, he undertook the care of Shannon.  He was observed by his mother and by a man for whom he worked, Mr Johns, to be a good father, caring and responsible.  Shannon himself confirmed this in a short statement, in which he also recounted occasions on which the offender had gone out of his way to help others, including rescuing a little girl who had fallen into a river at a camp.  His mother described him as ""always ... compassionate and caring to others.""  She frankly acknowledged that she could not accept the jury's verdicts, describing the offences as ""totally out of character for the person I know.""  
16The dark side of the offender's history is that, when he was about 9 years old, he was sexually abused by a teacher at his school for a 6 month period.  On a later occasion, when he was about 11, he was also abused by a Catholic priest.  He said nothing about this abuse until much later, when he was an adult.  He approached the Catholic church to seek an investigation into this behaviour, apparently without success, but the matter was never reported to the police.
17His mother wrote of him that, when he was about 10 years old, ""he seemed to change and lose his loving, easy nature.  He seemed to close up and not trust in people.""  He displayed anxiety but the family could not get him ""to explain his fears.""  She added that, despite this change in his disposition, she never saw him ""show any violence, aggression or nastiness to anyone in her house or any neighbours.""
18Dr Furst noted a history of low self-esteem and depression throughout the offender's late teens and early twenties.  He described persistent flashbacks and intrusive memories of his abuse, and suffered chronic insomnia.  These problems endured into his thirties.  Over the years he had been on medication for depression and anxiety.  He has remained on a course of medication since coming into custody, and has also been undergoing psychological counselling by Ms Penelope Walk.  Also in evidence are progress reports by Ms Walk prepared in 2009.
19Dr Furst also noted a pattern of drinking and use of cannabis by the offender of sufficient significance to lead to a diagnosis of Substance Use Disorder.  The doctor's primary diagnosis, from the history of sexual abuse and its enduring effects, was Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  He recommended continuing drug and alcohol counselling and psychological therapy.
20The offender's conduct in custody has been satisfactory.  He has been employed, and has undergone vocational training courses and courses in personal development.  There is Torres Strait Islander blood in his background, and he has also worked as an Aboriginal delegate.  Apart from the professional intervention of Ms Walk, he has had the benefit of counselling and support from a chaplain at the prison where he is currently held.
21Dr Furst saw the offender's prognosis as ""positive.""  He saw his engagement in treatment ""and other vocational training and work endeavours, family support, and efforts to support other indigenous inmates"" as ""positive factors when assessing his prospects of rehabilitation.""  In the light of the whole of the offender's history and his current mental state, the doctor thought it probable that he was at ""low risk of future violence.""  
22I should make it clear that this psychiatric material is relevant to the offender's background and to his prospects of rehabilitation.  It provides no explanation for his involvement in the present offences, and was not proffered as such.  
Victim impact statement
23I received a victim impact statement by Mrs Weightman's sister, Margaret Irwin.  I had also received a statement by her in sentencing David Weightman, as did Fullerton J when she sentenced the offender after the first trial.  Mrs Irwin's recent statement, expressed forcefully and eloquently, is further testament to her grief and outrage at these terrible crimes, and to the serious and enduring effects they have had upon her and her family.  I am particularly conscious of the agony she and the family must have suffered waiting so long for this offender to come to justice.  Yet again, I express my deepest sympathy to Mrs Irwin and the family.
Sentencing
24The Crown prosecutor who prosecuted the offender did not appear in David Weightman's sentence proceedings.  In the trial before me the offender was represented by Mr Ramage QC, instructed by Mr Phillip Green, solicitor.  Neither of them had represented him in the first trial.  
25The Crown prosecutor submitted that the gravity of these two murders was such as to call for the imposition of the maximum sentence, imprisonment for the offender's life.  The primary focus of the arguments for the Crown and the offender was whether I should take that course, rather than impose determinate sentences.  Both counsel took me to s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and to authority bearing upon it.  There is no need to set out that section or refer to those authorities.  The principles are well known and do not call for restatement.  A helpful summary of them, with reference to relevant legislation and authority, is to be found in the remarks on sentence of Fullerton J at [55] - [61], [65].
26Undoubtedly, the criminality of these two offences is grave indeed.  In the sanctity of their home Mr and Mrs Weightman were killed in a brutal manner.  The exertion required of the offender to kill Mrs Weightman did not deter him from proceeding with the killing of her husband.  He bore them no ill will.  His motive can only have been financial gain.  As to that matter I accept the evidence of David Weightman.  In the event, the offender was never paid his reward but, of course, that is of no moment for present purposes.  
27The other aspects of David Weightman's evidence which remain in dispute are more troubling.  He first admitted his involvement in the killings under pressure, in the course of a confrontation with Mrs Irwin, who suspected as much.  The possibility that he sought to sanitise his role in the killings  during his interviews with the police and in his evidence cannot be ignored.  In the trial before me Mr Ramage mounted a sustained attack upon his credibility, with a good deal of material to support it.
28I have recounted David Weightman's evidence that it was this offender who first raised the question of killing his parents and who formulated the plan to do so.  Yet it was David Weightman who initiated the discussion about what he stood to gain by his parents' death, and there was evidence from other witnesses that on earlier occasions he had spoken of killing his parents to secure his inheritance.  To what extent he was serious about that, and whether he would have done so without the intervention of the offender, I cannot say.  I suspect that he was more involved in the planning of the killing of his parents than he has been prepared to disclose.  However, even if that be so, it in no way reduces the offender's culpability.  The fact remains that the killings were planned.  
29As I have said, David Weightman's evidence that he drugged his parents with tablets supplied by the offender is also challenged.  If he did attempt to do so, it was clearly ineffective.  Both of them struggled before they died.  Traces of drugs found in the blood of each of them on post-mortem examination were the subject of pharmacological evidence at the trial.  It is unnecessary to examine that evidence in any detail.  It is sufficient to say that the nature of the substances detected, and the quantity of them, would not have produced any significant sedative effect.
30The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should conclude that the offender provided David Weightman with tablets of some kind, knowing them to be ineffective, so as to make it appear that he was complying with his stipulation that his parents should not suffer as they were killed.  I would not draw that conclusion, which I do not consider to be fairly available on the evidence.  It is not apparent why the offender would not supply David Weightman with genuinely sedative drugs, because the sedation of his victims would undoubtedly have made his task easier.  Mr Ramage, for his part, argued that I should reject this aspect of David Weightman's evidence and find that drugging his parents was not any part of the plan.  I do not find it necessary to resolve this controversy in assessing the offender's culpability.   The fact remains that he killed both of the deceased in the teeth of their resistance.  Nor does it have any significant bearing upon the culpability of David Weightman himself, which, as will be seen, is a matter I also need to consider.
31Fullerton J determined that life sentences were called for because of the objective gravity of the offences, and the need for retribution and deterrence: [79] of her remarks.  Unlike the proceedings before me, it seems that there was no evidence before her Honour of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation: [78], [80].  Nevertheless, she was not satisfied that the case fell ""within the worst category of homicide or the most extreme case, although it falls very close to it.""  She noted that, while the killings were premeditated, the planning was ""nevertheless unprofessional and, to an extent, amateurish"": [64].  I agree with those findings but, for my part, they give me pause in considering whether the maximum sentence is called for.
32However that may be, an important factor in whether life sentences should be imposed is the manner in which I dealt with David Weightman.  Fullerton J expressed the view (at [23] of her remarks) that no question of parity or relativity in the sentences passed upon the two offenders arose because of aspects of the material on sentence in David Weightman's case to which I shall refer, and a reading of her Honour's remarks conveys to me that the issue was not explored before her.  It was before me, and it requires examination.
33Of course, I sentenced David Weightman upon the facts emerging from his untested account to police.  Moreover, there was before me psychiatric evidence bearing upon his culpability which was unchallenged.  It is now apparent that that evidence was misleading.  In both trials of the present offender, David Weightman acknowledged that the history and the description of his symptoms which he had provided to the psychiatrists were fabricated.
34The psychiatric evidence, emanating from two respected forensic psychiatrists, conveyed a history of poly-drug abuse, and auditory and visual hallucinations, since he was about 18 years old.  The doctors diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia or, at least, a disorder of that kind: [17] of my remarks.  The Crown prosecutor then appearing accepted that he might have been in the early phase of development of a mental illness at the time of the killings, and that that factor took the case out of the worst category which might have called for life imprisonment.  I saw that as a proper concession, although I added that the psychiatric evidence conveyed  ""that the effect of that condition on his criminal behaviour would have been minimal"": [20].
35I also accepted that he was affected by drugs to a degree at the time of the killings, and that the combination of his mental condition and his drug use impaired his judgment and made him more susceptible to the influence of his older accomplice.  I was also prepared to accept that he was to some extent influenced by his accomplice, ""who conceived the idea of killing his parents and formulated the plan to put it into effect.""  I observed, however, that these matters could not significantly mitigate the gravity of his crimes: [21].
36I accepted, ""for what it is worth,"" that he hoped that his parents would be unconscious when they were asphyxiated and would feel no pain: [26].  I also accepted that he was genuinely remorseful: [24].
37I took into account his pleas of guilty, his co-operation with the police in the admissions he made and his assistance to the authorities, that is, his implication of the present offender and his willingness to give evidence against him.  I reduced the sentences otherwise appropriate by 30% in recognition of those factors.  But for them, I would have imposed sentences aggregating imprisonment for 40 years.  Because of them, I imposed sentences aggregating 28 years with an effective non-parole period of 22 years: [29] - [30].
38The Crown prosecutor in the present case submitted that these factors properly led to a very different approach to the sentence of David Weightman from that required of the present offender.  In particular, she argued that the fact that my undiscounted starting point for David Weightman was an overall determinate sentence of 40 years should not stay my hand in imposing a sentence of life imprisonment upon this offender.  While acknowledging that the leniency I extended to David Weightman was in part based upon his deception, she maintained an argument that his criminality was significantly less than that of the offender.  She emphasised the fact that it was the offender who actually killed both the victims, and she asked me to accept that it was he who had hatched the plan to kill them and that his much younger co-offender had participated in the plan under his influence.
39Those last propositions I cannot accept.  It was David Weightman who stood primarily to gain from these murders.  I do not suggest, of course, that the gravity of murders committed for financial gain should be measured by the magnitude of the financial benefit sought.  However, the substantial inheritance which David Weightman expected, and his enjoyment of it after his parents' death, convey to me that he was in no sense a reluctant participant in these crimes.  I have expressed misgivings about his evidence that the plan to kill his parents was raised by the offender and developed by him.  However, as I have said earlier, the extent to which each of them contributed to the development of the plan has little or no bearing upon the assessment of their culpability.  Even if it be accepted that he wanted no part in the killing of his parents and hoped that they would suffer no pain, this does him little credit.  The fact remains that he was prepared to stand by while the offender killed them and, in the event, to assist in the killing of his father.  It is, of course, also of significance that the victims were his adoptive parents, who had cared and provided for him.
40As is sometimes the case, this was a joint criminal enterprise in which the objective gravity of the parties' conduct was much the same, notwithstanding differences in the nature and level of their participation.  From the passages of my remarks on sentence in David Weightman's case, it is apparent that in determining his culpability I gave little weight to the psychiatric evidence concerning his mental state at the time of the killings, to my finding that he was to some extent influenced by the present offender, and to his desire that his parents should be unconscious and feel no pain when they were asphyxiated.  My finding that he was remorseful is difficult to sustain in the light of his subsequent admission that his subjective case was to some extent the product of deception.  I did take into account his youth, which was appropriate and which remains a factor entitling him to a measure of leniency which the offender cannot claim.  
41Given David Weightman's youth, and the fact that my assessment of the undiscounted aggregate sentence he should face was influenced, albeit to a limited extent, by material now known to be false, the present offender could have no justifiable sense of grievance if I impose upon him a somewhat greater aggregate sentence.  However, justice demands an appropriate relativity between his sentence and the undiscounted sentence I proposed for David Weightman.  To sentence the offender to imprisonment for the rest of his life, when David Weightman faced at most a substantial determinate sentence, could not be justified.  
42All that said, I am at a loss to understand how the offender could have committed such dreadful crimes, given his background and general good character.  The nature of his offences raises a question as to his prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding Dr Furst's favourable assessment.  Nevertheless, the matters raised in Dr Furst's report support the conclusion, albeit a guarded one, that those prospects are reasonable and that he does not pose a danger to society.  In any event, he faces a very long prison term.  The effect of the sentences I intend to pass is that he will not be eligible for release on parole until he is in his early 70s, and the aggregate sentence will not expire until his early 80s.
43As the offences were committed in 2000, they precede the introduction of the standard non-parole period for murder and that provision does not bear upon this sentencing exercise.  Mr Ramage referred me to a number of sentence cases involving serious offences of murder, extending over much of the previous decade.  Reference to roughly comparable cases can be a useful exercise but, given that each case turns on its own facts, it is of relatively little assistance.  Whether the pattern of sentence for murder has changed since 2000 was not a matter examined in counsel's submissions.  Because of the exceptional gravity of the offender's crimes, I doubt that any such examination would have been of any benefit.  Given the length of the sentences which I must impose, I would not find special circumstances and depart from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period.  Mr Ramage did not submit that I should.
44Although the murders were committed in the course of the same criminal episode, the gravity of each of them is such that there must be a significant accumulation of sentence.  The sentence for each offence will be imprisonment for 40 years with a non-parole period of 30 years, and the sentence on the second offence will be accumulated upon the first by 3 years.  The aggregate sentence, then, will be 43 years, with an effective non-parole period of 33 years, dating from 16 June 2006.  The relationship of the effective non-parole period to the aggregate sentence is a little more than the statutory proportion, but no lesser minimum term would be sufficient to mark the offender's criminality.  He will be eligible for release on parole on 15 June 2039, and the aggregate sentence will expire on 15 June 2049.  
45Terry Mark Donai, for the murder of Pamela Weightman you are sentenced to imprisonment for 40 years, commencing on 16 June 2006 and expiring on 15 June 2046, with a non-parole period of 30 years, expiring on 15 June 2036.  For the murder of William Weightman you are sentenced to imprisonment for 40 years, commencing on 16 June 2009 and expiring on 15 June 2049, with a non-parole period of 30 years, expiring on 15 June 2039.

2760075,R v Kelly [2012] NSWSC 1104,"Judgment

1 HIS HONOUR: Peter Joseph Kelly is to be sentenced for the murder of Maria (""Lou"") Devrell at Tamworth on 28 March 2011. 

Victim impact

2When the Crown and defence cases on sentence were presented on 10 August last, Ms Amy Devrell, the daughter of the deceased, bravely read a prepared victim impact statement. The grief and distress that she and her father have suffered through the loss of a person who was described as ""a beautiful woman"" who ""could have brightened anyone's day"" is almost unfathomable. At the outset of these sentencing remarks I want to acknowledge that suffering and again extend my deepest sympathy. I also trust that Ms Devrell will not lose hope and will fulfil the faith that her mother had that she would realise her full potential.

Penalty

3Murder is an offence for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. There is also prescribed a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole periods are legislative guideposts that I must be mindful of in determining the appropriate sentence after having taken into account all factors that are relevant to the sentence.

Facts 

4The offender entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court on 21 September 2011 and has adhered to it in this Court.

5The circumstances relating to the offence are disclosed in an agreed statement of facts from which, largely, I have derived the following.

6The offender was a financial advisor living on the Central Coast. He had known the husband of the deceased, Mr David Devrell, for about 25 years. In 1999 Mr Devrell won $5 million in Oz Lotto. He sought financial advice from a number of people before finally choosing the offender to take over management of his financial affairs.

7Mr and Mrs Devrell moved from the Central Coast to Tamworth. The offender travelled to Tamworth about every three months in order to discuss with them their financial affairs. A situation emerged in which they were spending money more quickly than it was being allocated to them by the offender. He seems to have had the attitude that they were being wasteful.

8An agreement was reached whereby the offender reduced the amount of spending money he was allocating but their spending continued to exceed their allowance. As a result he persuaded them to give him power of attorney so that he could operate their accounts. This was designed to give him greater control over the management of their money.

9The offender and Mr Devrell planned to go on a four day camping and hunting trip to a property at Watsons Creek, near Bendemeer, on 28 March 2011. The offender left his home on the Central Coast and proceeded towards the property but he detoured to the Devrells' home in Tamworth as he was uncertain of the directions to the property. He arrived at the home at about 1.50pm.

10Mr Devrell was not home; he had already left for Watsons Creek. Mrs Devrell took the opportunity to engage the offender in a conversation concerning her wish to have more money. An argument ensued. She became angry and pushed him over. He got up and pushed her back, causing her to fall over.

11He went outside. He said that he was furious and ""seeing crimson"". He took a heavy rubber mallet from his vehicle and wrapped it in cling wrap because he ""did not want any blood sticking to the mallet"". He went back inside the house and approached Mrs Devrell from behind. She was sitting at a table. He hit her on the head with the mallet. He subsequently said that his intention was to cause her to ""lose all memory of the argument we just had"".

12Mrs Devrell slumped forward but then straightened up. The offender struck her again on the head with the mallet. He subsequently said that his intention at this point was to knock her unconscious. Mrs Devrell turned to speak to him so he pulled her backwards onto the floor, clamping his hand on her mouth and nose whilst hitting her a further two times on the head with the mallet. He continued to hold his hand over her mouth and nose until she was quiet.

13The offender noticed Mrs Devrell's purse sitting on the kitchen bench. He took it to make it appear that the incident had been a robbery that had gone wrong.

14He left the home and proceeded to join Mr Devrell at the Watsons Creek property. On the way he threw from his moving vehicle the clothing he had been wearing as well as the mallet and the deceased's purse. He had removed the cash from the purse and secreted it.

15Ms Amy Devrell arrived home with friends at about 7.00pm. She discovered her mother's body lying on the living room floor. She was on her side with one arm raised with her hand near her face. There were significant injuries to the back of her head and lacerations to her face. There was a large amount of blood on the floor around her head.

16Ms Devrell screamed and collapsed. She called the ambulance service and told the operator what she had found. A friend took the phone from her and received instructions from the operator about performing CPR. He continued with CPR until ambulance officers arrived and determined that Mrs Devrell was in fact deceased. Police were summoned.

17An autopsy was conducted on 30 March 2011. The direct cause of death was found to be blunt force injuries to the head and asphyxiation. Three main groups of injuries were noted:


1.Two complex lacerations to the back of the head without underlying skull fractures, consistent with multiple blows to the head with a blunt object.

2.Linear abrasions around the nose and bruising to the lips, consistent with applied pressure to the nose and mouth causing asphyxiation.

3.Linear abrasions on the arms and back of the shoulders, consistent with restraint.

18At least six separate areas of ill-defined bruising to the scalp were also noted.

19There was also a fracture to the 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae associated with bruising to the anterior soft tissue. 

20A neuropathological examination of the brain revealed, amongst other things, that the deceased had sustained a traumatic brain injury. 

21It is worth quoting from the autopsy report in relation to the two ""complex lacerations to the back of the head"":

There were two closely positioned full thickness scalp lacerations at the back of the head. One of the injuries (upper) was larger and stellate-shaped with loose edges which were detached from the underlying intact skull.

22The photograph of the larger laceration (photograph 30 in Exhibit F) demonstrates the severity of this injury.

23A police investigation commenced almost immediately. At about 3.30am on 29 March 2011 detectives attended the Watsons Creek property and spoke with the offender and Mr Devrell. The offender did not tell them that he had been at the Devrell home the day before. Mr Devrell accompanied the officers back to Tamworth while the offender remained for a time at the property.

24Police obtained a statement from the offender during the afternoon of 29 March. On this occasion he revealed that he had been at the Devrell home at around 2.00pm the previous day. He said that she answered the front door and he spoke with her for a short time before leaving.

25The following day the offender was formally interviewed for just under three hours. He outlined his relationship with the Devrells; his management of their money and superannuation; his frequent visits to their home; and the context and circumstances of the shooting trip to Watsons Creek he had planned with Mr Devrell. He told police about how when he had attended the home on 28 March he had gone with Mrs Devrell to the kitchen where they had a conversation about a bill she had received. He said that he asked to use the toilet and was permitted to use that which was in the en-suite bathroom to the main bedroom. He said that he noticed nothing unusual and he left the house after using the toilet. He did not see Mrs Devrell as he left. He said that he had been inside the house for about ten minutes.

26Police told the offender that they were investigating a murder and that he was a suspect. He agreed to provide a DNA sample and his vehicle was seized for forensic examination. A rolled-up bundle of money was found hidden under a cap on the rear near side suspension post. This was the money the offender had taken from the deceased's purse. Analysis of blood found in the vehicle revealed that it was from the deceased.

27The offender left Tamworth on the morning of 31 March 2011 in a hire car. Around 9.00pm that night police found the offender in the hire car at a lookout at Patonga with the engine running and exhaust fumes being pumped into the interior via a hose. He was barely conscious and was taken to hospital by ambulance. It was established that he had consumed a quantity of tablets and alcohol.

28The offender was arrested at his home at Umina Beach on 10 April 2011. He was cautioned and taken to Gosford police station. He declined to answer police questions after receiving legal advice. He was charged and has been in custody since.

29On 9 September 2011 (prior to the plea of guilty) the offender, through his counsel, provided police with information regarding the weapon used to kill Mrs Devrell and its whereabouts. He said he had used a rubber mallet to hit her on the head. He also disclosed that he had taken her purse and money. Directions were provided as to where the mallet, purse and his blood stained clothing had been thrown from his vehicle. Police recovered the mallet and the purse but not the clothing.

30The mallet was 385mm long; the diameter of the head was 135mm and its total weight was 1.3kg.

31On 6 October 2011 (subsequent to the plea of guilty) the offender signed a prepared statement admitting to the killing of the deceased and the taking of her purse in order to make it look like ""a robbery gone wrong"". On 31 October 2011 he took part in a lengthy interview in which he expanded upon the statement.

32The statement of 6 October 2011 and a transcript of the interview of 31 October 2011 were tendered before me without objection.

33The statement of 6 October 2011 includes that there was a discussion with the deceased about her wish to be allocated more money and she was also complaining of certain family matters. He said that he thought ""this tipped me over the edge. I'm sick of hearing her complaining and blaming everyone in the world for her problems"". He said the deceased became increasingly angry with him and pushed him over. He was shocked and instinctively got up and pushed her over. He then hurried out of the house. He was ""seeing crimson"" and ""was furious"". He said, ""All I could think of was losing everything that I have worked for all my life"". He was asked about this in his evidence at the sentence hearing and he said that he did not know what that meant; he did not know what he was thinking when he said that; and that it was not true.

34The statement continues by saying that he said he stood beside the vehicle for a couple of minutes thinking what to do next. He saw guns, axes and the mallet in the car. He chose the mallet. He said, ""I then formed the intention to re-enter the house and to strike Lou with the mallet"". The mallet was chosen because he ""knew the guns or axes would kill her"" or ""would have done too much damage"". He wrapped the mallet with glad wrap which was sitting loose in the back of the car in order to avoid blood sticking to it.

35He then recounted his assault upon the deceased. He said ""what I intended was that the blow to her head would cause her to lose all memory of the argument that we had just had. I thought that when she awoke it would be like starting afresh and that we could discuss the matter rationally"". Of course, after he had struck her he did not wait around for her to wake up.

36The statement then sets out the events in the house as they are summarised in the agreed facts but some further detail appears in relation to the continuation of the assault when the deceased was on the floor. He said ""I then pulled her backwards from a seated position to a position where she was lying on the floor on her back. ... I held my left hand firmly over her mouth and nose and with the rubber mallet struck her to the rear of the head a couple more times whilst holding the mallet in my right hand"".

37Further details of the offender's account of the incident were provided in the interview of 31 October 2011. He said that he spoke to Mrs Devrell about the prospect of the money running out and that she said that he would have to provide her with spending money himself. He said ""it wasn't my role to give them my money. She was threatening my family's lifestyle. ... How dare she"" (Q. 64). He said, ""I was ropeable"" (Q. 65).

38He was asked about his reasons for wrapping the mallet in cling wrap. He said ""It'd be pretty clear that, if there was matter left on the mallet, and it was my mallet, it's pretty bloody obvious that it would be, it would implicate me. I just didn't want any apparent connection"" (Q. 175). This tends to indicate clear and deliberate thinking on the offender's behalf.

39In relation to the asphyxiation, the offender said that ""she was struggling, kicking a bit. I kept my hand over her mouth, firmly over her mouth. And with the mallet, I struck her on the back of the head again, I think another two times. And then she stopped struggling, and she went quiet"" (Q. 118). He said he had been told by his lawyer that the pathology evidence was that he must have held his hand over her mouth for a minute, at least. He could not recall how long it was but accepted that it must have been a minute. He said ""she was kicking ... throwing the left arm around a bit, trying to, I suppose push me away with it. Kicking, and wriggling like that"" (Q. 200-202).

40As to how he was feeling he said, ""I was just so furious with the woman"" and ""I was just incensed; I was livid"" (Q. 169). ""I was in a rage"" (Q. 547). However, he considered that he was not thinking logically or rationally, ""Because I wouldn't have gone back into the house if I was"" (Q. 170).

41When he left the house he knew that Mrs Devrell was bleeding and was unconscious (Q. 254-255). There was blood on the floor around her. Her scalp injury was bleeding. There was blood on her face. This is how he got blood on his shoes and jeans (Q. 304-305).

42In the first of two psychiatric reports by Dr Stephen Allnutt there is an account of the offender having said that the deceased demanded money from him but he told her that he was not working. She responded ""Well I'll take the money from your wife"". He told Dr Allnutt that when he heard this he felt ""livid""; ""when he heard her speak about his wife in the manner she did he told her to get fucked"". He is also reported to have said ""he walked outside the house; he could not recall his thoughts; he felt furious ... he thought he was tired of taking the abuse from her; he was angry that she expected he and his wife to pay for her gambling; he felt like he wanted to hit her; he wanted to give her a 'hiding'; he felt 'over it'"".

43In Dr Allnutt's second report the offender is quoted as having said ""things escalated where he lost control of his senses - there was much yelling; he said that if they ran out of money he would have to pay for her gambling, then she said she would make his wife pay; this was the last straw"". It is notable that there was no mention in anything the offender had said to the police of the deceased making reference to his wife.

44I have mentioned that the offender gave evidence at the sentence hearing. He said that he had told Dr Allnutt the truth and that his reports contained an accurate account of what he had said.

45He acknowledged in his evidence in chief that he had said in the past, albeit sometime after the incident, that he did not intend to kill the deceased. He said, with what seemed at the time to be candour, that he could not say with certainty that he did not intend to kill; but he had no recollection of ever having that intent.

46As to wrapping the mallet in cling wrap, he said that he had that for the camping trip and it was for wrapping left over food so that ants would not get in to it. He said he was not sure what he was thinking at the time of wrapping the mallet; he felt that he did it so as to avoid any biological matter getting on to it. He acknowledged that this indicated that he intended to strike Mrs Devrell with sufficient force that it might get such matter on it. He then insisted that ""I can say with certainty at the time I wasn't intending to kill her. If I was sir I would have picked up one of the other more lethal items in the car"". This is in contrast to the apparent concession he had made earlier about not being able to say with certainty that he did not have an intention to kill.

Seriousness of the offence

47Despite the offender's claim that he did not intend to kill, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did. I do not regard his account of what he was thinking as having any credibility.

48I do not accept as credible his claim that his choice of a heavy mallet, wrapped in cling wrap so as to avoid biological matter adhering to it, instead of the other options of an axe or a gun, supported his claim that he did not intend to kill. The mallet was capable of being used with lethal effect with less noise and mess.

49It was submitted that the absence of skull fractures indicated that the offender was not using maximum force when striking the deceased with the mallet and that this militated against a finding that he intended to kill. That argument might have had merit if the sole cause of death was blunt force trauma. But the offender killed by disablement with the mallet blows and then suffocated the deceased by holding his hand over her mouth and nose until she died.

50I also find to be incredible the offender's claims that he thought Mrs Devrell was simply unconscious when he left her; he put her in the recovery position; and that he expected she would receive medical attention when her daughter arrived home. He had struck her four times with a heavy mallet which resulted in blood being on and about her head to the extent that it got on his hands, clothing and shoes. Putting her in a recovery position was not going to help her when she was bleeding from head wounds to that extent. True it is that when Ms Devrell ultimately arrived home she found her mother lying on her side. But the offender explained to the police in the 31 October 2011 interview that her head was turned to the side when he held one hand over her mouth and struck her with the mallet to the back of the head (Q. 127 - 138).

51The most revealing admission, indicative of an intention to kill, was that she was ""kicking"", ""wriggling"" and ""throwing the left arm around a bit, trying to ... push me away with it"" while he held his hand firmly over her mouth and struck her twice in the back of the head with the mallet until she stopped struggling and went quiet (Q. 118; 200-202).

52The claim that he made the scene look like ""a robbery gone wrong"" is indicative of clear thinking on his part and a knowledge that she would not survive and be able to nominate him as the assailant.

53Another matter that raises doubt about the offender's credibility generally is that he claimed to Dr Allnutt that the deceased's demand that the offender's wife pay for her living expenses was a significant factor in making him ""livid"". But that is not what he told the police in any of the versions provided to them. 

54Often it is the case that an intention to kill, as opposed to an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, renders an offence of murder more serious. The authorities on the subject recognise, however, that this is not always so. In this case, even if I was not satisfied that there was an intention to kill, I do not believe that the seriousness of the offence would have been significantly less. Counsel for the offender conceded as much in the course of his submissions.

55I accept that there is no evidence that the offender harboured an intention to kill the deceased prior to the time he arrived at her home. The killing is not, however, something that occurred in the heat of the moment. After the argument had ended with the offender pushing the deceased to the floor, he walked outside to his car and, it would seem, stewed over whether and how to vent his anger further. He then chose his weapon and took the care to wrap it in cling wrap in an attempt to avoid evidence that would incriminate him being in his possession after the event. This tends to indicate a degree of cold and calculating deliberation.

56It was submitted on behalf of the offender that I should find that the seriousness of the offence is mitigated by the fact that it was committed under provocation. I am not satisfied that it is more probable than not that he was provoked to the point where he experienced a loss of self-control. My review of the all of the evidence leads me to conclude that the offender was driven by the argument with the deceased to become angry, or as he said, ""livid"", ""ropeable"" or ""furious"". I cannot detect a loss of self-control, even with it being acknowledged that the offender acted out of character and had no history of violence. The aspects of his conduct to which I have referred which indicate clear and deliberate thinking and forethought are inconsistent with the claimed loss of self-control.

57I am satisfied that this offence is one of considerable objective gravity.

58Before departing from the objective circumstances of the offence I must make this observation. The facts which have been agreed between the prosecution and the defence have largely drawn upon the offender's version. That is understandable as there are no witnesses available to contradict it. 

59There are quite a number of aspects of the offender's account which defy logic and commonsense. For example, how could he have left a woman who was lying on the ground bleeding heavily from head wounds that he had inflicted thinking that she was simply unconscious and would recover with no memory of the argument that he claimed had occurred? Why did the deceased's supposed demand that he, or his wife, should pay for her lifestyle make him angry and think that he might ""lose everything"" that he had worked for"" and that ""she was threatening [his] family's lifestyle"" when the deceased was in no position to enforce such a demand? 

60I have been left with the distinct impression that the full truth behind the killing of Mrs Devrell has not been told. I cannot, however, sentence upon speculation as to what the true story might be and so I must assess the sentence based only upon the evidence that has been placed before me.

Subjective features

61Evidence concerning the offender's personal circumstances comprised criminal and custodial history printouts, the two reports of Dr Allnutt to which I have already referred, and numerous testimonials. In addition there was the oral testimony of the offender's son.

62The offender was born in May 1957. He was 53 years old at the time of the offence. 

63He was the younger of his adoptive parents' two children and grew up in a supportive family environment. His childhood was unremarkable, although he told Dr Allnutt that he had been bullied at school. His mother passed away in 1982 and his father in 2000. 

64The offender appears to have led an industrious and family oriented life prior to the offence. He has been married for 25 years. His wife is a registered nurse and prior to the offender's incarceration the couple lived together at Umina. They have two adult sons; the eldest is a 22-year-old physiotherapist and the youngest is aged 20 and has recently commenced training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon.

65The offender's wife and two sons each provided testimonials. Mrs Kelly stated that her marriage to the offender had been a happy one. All of them attested to the offender's dedication to his family and to the strong support he has given his sons. The eldest son also gave evidence at the sentence hearing that the offender was a ""very calm and collected"" sort of person. He said that conflict within the family was dealt with by discussion and not violence.

66There are references in the testimonials to the offender being a non-violent person and most of the authors expressed shock and disbelief at his commission of this offence. Mrs Kelly, like many others, described the offence as completely out of character. She said, ""I still cannot understand what may have led him to committing this crime."" 

67Until his incarceration, the offender had spent his career working in the finance sector. He was a branch manager with a credit union before moving to a large fund manager. In 1998 he started his own business as a financial planner. Many of the testimonials also refer to the offender being an active member of his local community. He has volunteered his time with various organisations, including with his sons' junior sports teams and with motor clubs.

68Dr Allnutt indicates that the offender has had no further thoughts of suiciding after the attempt on 31 March 2011 . He has no history of drug or alcohol abuse. He shows signs of stress referrable to the offence and his incarceration, and the considerable toll these have taken on his family and marriage. Dr Allnutt suggests that the offender could be diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder but otherwise does not suffer from any psychiatric illness. He said of the offender that he ""perceived the deceased and her husband as being wasteful people and would have been vulnerable to being irritated by them, by their value system and world view which would have conflicted with his"".

69Dr Allnutt recorded that the offender was shocked by what he had done. He recognised that his actions had ""devastated"" the deceased's family. He told Dr Allnutt, ""I'm horrified by the fact that I've caused someone to die."" Authors of testimonials have stated that he has expressed remorse for the offence. 

Specific mitigating factors

70The offender entered a plea of guilty to murder in the Local Court on 21 September 2011. The Crown conceded in written submissions that a reduction of sentence of 25 per cent was appropriate for the utilitarian value of the plea. I accept that concession.

71Consideration must be given to the co-operation by the offender with the police by way of giving directions as to where the mallet and the deceased's purse could be found; providing the statement of 6 October 2011 and agreeing to be interviewed on 31 October 2011. I have found that he was not completely frank with the police in that he denied an intention to kill the deceased but aside from that he should get credit for such assistance. It would seem that without his admissions the prosecution case would have been a circumstantial one, albeit a powerful one given, for example, that the deceased's blood was found in the offender's car.

72The offender has no prior criminal record and I accept that he was a person of good character. His counsel, Mr Givorshner, submitted that such a finding was often based solely on an absence of prior convictions but in this case there was positive evidence of it. I accept that the commission of this offence was an uncharacteristic aberration in the otherwise blameless life of a good man.

73Mr Givorshner submitted that the offender's suicide attempt was ""pretty good evidence... of contrition"" but he acknowledged that I may find this was driven rather by a realisation of the ramifications of the offence for his family. I am satisfied that the offender's statement to the police at the end of the 31 October 2011 interview and his later statements to Dr Allnutt and his referees demonstrate genuine remorse on his part regardless of what he has said about his intention.

74In light of the offender's remorse and his prior good character, I am also satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation.

Special Circumstances

75It was submitted that I should find there are special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. In his written submissions Mr Givorshner referred to the ""circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, the early plea of guilty, [and] the subjective case of the offender"" as appropriate to afford his client a degree of leniency. These are matters I have already taken into account when determining the total term of the sentence. It would be double counting to take them into account again to reduce the non-parole period.

76It was also put that this will be the offender's first time in prison and reference was made to the likely age of the offender when he would eligible for release on parole. It was submitted, ""the older you are, the harder the readjustment is going to be."" I do not believe such a generalisation is valid. Readjustment to life in the community following release from a lengthy term of imprisonment is difficult for just about everyone. I am satisfied that the potential period of parole which will be available by adoption of the usual statutory proportions is sufficient in this case.

Sentence

77Convicted

78Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years 6 months. The sentence will date from 10 April 2011. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 9 October 2024.

79That is a total sentence of 18 years. If not for the offender's plea of guilty it would have been a sentence of 24 years.

		14 September 2012",2012-09-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760076,Le v R [2012] NSWCCA 202,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2HALL J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

3R A HULME J: Huu Hong Le was found guilty by a jury of larceny and discharging a firearm with intent to resist arrest. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a total term of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

4I will refer to Mr Le as the applicant because leave to appeal is required. The contentions raised in this Court were never raised by the applicant's counsel at trial: r 4 Criminal Appeal Rules. Indeed, the decisions of the trial judge now the subject of challenge were either actively supported by the applicant's counsel or, at least, not opposed. Counsel in this Court did not appear at the trial.

5Before turning to the grounds of appeal it is worth observing the repeated disapproval expressed by this Court about appeals of this nature, often described as ""armchair appeals"". There are many statements to this effect. For example, Tobias JA, James and Howie JJ in R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; (2003) 151 A Crim R 166 stated:

[38] We take this opportunity for the Court once again to deprecate what has been referred to as an ""armchair appeal"" (see R v Fuge (2001) 123 A Crim R 310 at [40]), where counsel briefed on appeal takes points, often of a technical nature, without any apparent regard to the manner in which the trial was conducted by competent defence counsel and where an easy remedy would have been available at trial, had counsel believed that his or her client was prejudiced by what the trial judge said or failed to say. Once again, there is little if any regard to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in raising such grounds of appeal, treating it as a technicality of little or no moment, notwithstanding repeated statements of this Court to the contrary: see for example R v King [2000] NSWCCA 507; the long line of authorities referred to in the judgment of Whealy J; R v Button and Griffin [2002] NSWCCA 159 per Heydon JA; and most recently R v Ita [2003] NSWCCA 174.

6There are three grounds of appeal:


1. There was a fundamental error of law going to the root of the trial process in that the trial judge embarked upon a process to discharge a juror before the discretion to discharge that juror was enlivened by s 53B(d) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW)

2. In the alternative the trial judge erred in law when exercising the discretion to discharge a juror in the trial of the applicant pursuant to s 53B(d) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW)

3. The trial judge erred in law when applying s 53C(1)(a)(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) to the continuation of the applicant's trial

7Given the nature of these grounds it is unnecessary to refer to the evidence or the facts underpinning the jury's verdicts. Rather, it is necessary to refer in some detail to the course of the trial.

8The trial commenced with the arraignment of the applicant and empanelment of the jury on Tuesday 17 August 2010. The jury were informed that the estimated length of the trial was three or four days. They were, however, also informed that the court would not be sitting on Friday 20 or Monday 23 August for reasons presently irrelevant. 

9The Crown case proceeded on 17, 18 and 19 August, resumed on Tuesday 24 August and continued on 25 August. It was at this point, with the Crown case about to close, that counsel for the applicant foreshadowed that his client would be giving evidence. In the course of disclosing certain aspects of the evidence it was anticipated the applicant would give, it emerged that there had been a failure to put certain things to the complainant in cross-examination. It was resolved that the complainant should be recalled for further cross-examination. It then emerged that he was unavailable until the following Tuesday.

10There was discussion about the length of the trial and the Crown Prosecutor reminded the judge what she had told the jury about the initial estimate. Her Honour brought the jury in and explained the need to adjourn until the following Tuesday. She invited jurors to let her know if anyone had any difficulties with work or personal commitments in the next week. She subsequently announced that none of the jurors had a problem with the trial continuing in the following week but that there was a problem if it went beyond that (T325).

11The trial continued with the jury on Tuesday 31 August. The complainant and another witness were recalled and the Crown case closed. The defence case proceeded for the balance of that day and closed on the luncheon adjournment on Wednesday 1 September. Before taking the morning adjournment that day, the trial judge announced:

HER HONOUR: Just in terms of timing, one of the jurors who indicated last week he had a problem if the matter went past Friday has raised that with the court officer again today. I don't think the trial will go past Friday ... (T445)

12Just after the luncheon adjournment that day the judge raised the issue again:

HER HONOUR: Just before we continue, there's a note from the anxious juror who says he's due to be in Malaysia on Monday to teach a course. He's self-employed. Unless he can reassure his customers tonight that he will definitely be there on Monday, they're going to cancel the course; he will suffer a significant financial penalty and penalty to his reputation. Is there anything I can do for him?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I'm anticipating to be in address this afternoon. I think my friend is as well.

PROVERA: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I'm quite happy to sit perhaps an additional half an hour this afternoon, or to start early tomorrow.

HER HONOUR: Well, no, if you think you'll both be addressing this afternoon then we should send the jury [out] tomorrow. I'll tell him he'll be there. I mean, if worse come to worst and the jury are still out, we might have to face the issue of discharging him, but he has raised it fairly.

PROVERA: Thank you.

HER HONOUR: All right. (T465)

13When the jury returned to court, the judge sought to reassure them as follows:

HER HONOUR: Just before we continue, one of you has written a note about a commitment you have on Monday, and I don't need to know who it is, but I understand you need to reassure your customers tonight that you will be there on Monday. You can do that. You will be there on Monday, whoever you are. I've just been talking to counsel. I'm confident on the basis of what they've told me that you will be going out to consider your verdicts tomorrow. Of course, once you retire it's a matter for you. There's no time pressure on you as to when you finish. But whoever that juror is, you will be where you need to be on Monday, so you can give your customer that reassurance. (T466)

14The defence case concluded that afternoon and the Crown Prosecutor addressed. On Thursday 2 September the trial proceeded with the closing address of the applicant's counsel and her Honour's summing up. The jury retired to consider its verdicts at 12:20pm. They were released just after 3:30pm and returned to continue their deliberations at 10am on Friday 3 September.

15A number of questions relevant to the jury's deliberations were received on the Friday morning. In the course of discussing them, counsel for the applicant raised the possibility of the juror with the commitment the following week experiencing some anxiety. There followed a discussion about what the judge should do. Reference was made to the need to comply with s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 in the event that discharge of a juror came to be considered. There was also reference by the Crown Prosecutor to the need to follow ""a two step process"". The judge acknowledged her understanding of such matters. The jury returned to court at 10:52am to receive her Honour's answers to various questions. 

16In the course of subsequent discussion with counsel about one of the jury questions the Crown Prosecutor raised the following suggestion:

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour my position is if the jury is still deliberating after lunch perhaps the matter should be raised then with them, there should be an assurance given that if they're likely to go into Monday there's been an indication that that will cause problems for that juror, that juror is welcome to come into court by himself and - so the matter can be sorted out.

HER HONOUR: Hmm okay. So maybe two o'clock we should reconsider it?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Or some time after two o'clock?

HER HONOUR: Sometime after two okay.

PROVERA: Yeah I'd be asking for two your Honour - matter for you, matter for you of course your Honour. (SU 36 - 37)

17The jury returned at 11:45am to receive further directions concerning one of the earlier questions and retired to continue their deliberations a minute later. Just after the luncheon adjournment, at the suggestion of the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the applicant, the judge brought the jury back in to allay any concerns they might have about the juror with the commitment the following week:

HER HONOUR: Members of the jury, I have brought you in just to raise a matter with you. I do not know whether all of you know but one of you has a commitment on Monday which he raised earlier in the week and has to be there on Monday. And I said to you yesterday there are no time pressures on you and I just wanted to explain to you that you do not have to reach a verdict by four o'clock today so that your colleague can go to his commitment on Monday, because I have the power to release him and continue with the rest of you if you have not reached a verdict by four o'clock today. So I just wanted to let that person know that that is how he can meet his commitment and how the rest of you should not feel any time pressure. All right, so I will send you back to your room to continue thanks. (SU 38)

18The jury retired once again at 2:11pm.

19At some time around the middle of the afternoon the court reconvened and the judge announced that there was another question from the jury concerning an issue in the trial. There was also a note from the juror in question that was marked for identification 12. There is handwriting on the MFI tag which includes ""14.45"", presumably the time that the note was received. The note was in the following terms:

Your Honour,
Thank you for your willingness to release me this evening if our deliberation is not complete.
I wasn't sure whether this would happen automatically now, so hence this request:
I request to be excused from jury service as of 4 pm 3 -Sept-2010 in order to meet a pressing work commitment.
Thank you.

20The following discussion occurred:

HER HONOUR: The juror who has a commitment next week has written a note asking to be excused as of four o'clock this afternoon to meet a pressing work commitment so he's kind of - but there's a question from the jury ...

[Discussion of the question from the jury took placed before the judge returned to the juror's note].

HER HONOUR: All right we'll bring them in and tell them that. And should we then deal with this man given the time 3.30?

PROVERA: Yes. In fact I just raised it with my friend given the timing I think that's an appropriate time your Honour rather than wait 15 minutes.

HER HONOUR: Okay, all right well I'll bring the jury in and tell them now, send them out and I'll have that man stay here.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour just before that's done should we deal with the juror first and excuse him and then send - and then you direct the jury that they can continue deliberating until four or we could send the rest of the jury home for the weekend if they'd prefer that course?

HER HONOUR: I thought I should answer their question - oh I see you say they can't continue deliberating without him. What are you saying?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well the way I look at it if we answer the question.

HER HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The jury can then continue deliberating but then we're taking out that juror from that additional deliberation. I'm just wondering whether or not that juror might've been the juror that had this question?

HER HONOUR: I don't have any idea who has the question but if I take that juror out I would really discharge him as of now so they could continue deliberating if they wished until four.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes I just - in fact your Honour I don't think it really matters which way it's done--

PROVERA: No I--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: --perhaps if we answer the question first then we can deal with him.

PROVERA: I don't think anything arises from it your Honour, matter for you of course. (SU 38-40) (Emphasis added)

21The jury returned to court at 3:30pm and the judge provided a response to their question. Having dealt with that, the following occurred:

HER HONOUR: ... I will ask the one juror who has the commitment on Monday to either stay or come back in when the rest of you have left and I will just deal with his situation and then the rest of you can decide whether you want to go for the day or stay until four. So if you just wait nearby thanks.

JURY RETIRED TO FURTHER CONSIDER ITS VERDICT AT 3.32PM

HER HONOUR: Sir come into the witness box please, I just need to have you clarify your situation on oath. I do not need your name.

JUROR, SWORN AT 3.32PM

EXAMINATION BY HER HONOUR

Q. All right now you've been a juror in this trial I think we're now at the end of week three and as I understand it you have a commitment to be in Malaysia on Monday?
A. That's right.

Q. And you raised this with me the other day and said you needed to confirm with your customers that you'd be there on Monday?
A. That's right.

Q. And you've done that?
A. Yes.

Q. And they're expecting you on Monday?
A. Yes.

Q. And so you would say that you can't continue to deliberate because your mind is really on the fact that you've promised to be somewhere on Monday?
A. That wasn't quite the main point that I was putting forward for me. I have been somewhat distracted because of this but it's more the - I guess you could say the hardship and consequences of not going on Monday that I'm, that I've been concerned about.

Q. Hmm and what are they, I know you've written me a note but can you just briefly summarise them?
A. Sure. I'm self employed, I only get paid when I work and I teach IT courses around the Asia/Pacific region. In order to be here I've cancelled one course and therefore I lost a certain amount of money and if I was not - if I was here again next week that - I guess that loss would mount up and that's quite significant for me.

HER HONOUR: Is there anything that counsel would like me to ask this gentleman?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.

PROVERA: No your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Okay. All right. Thank you sir, would you just step outside with your fellow jurors and I will be back to you shortly, well in fact don't go back to the room just wait outside and I will be with you in a minute.

THE WITNESS WITHDREW

HER HONOUR: [Court officer] if perhaps you just stay in the corridor with that gentleman for a minute and we will just come and let you know. Just make sure no one else gets involved. Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, my submission is that in view of his evidence that he is distracted from his deliberations and in view of the fact that the original estimate given was just one of four or five days and we are now in our third week, it is my submission that he falls within the ambit of s 53B(d) of the Jury Act and even after taking into account that the accused would be deprived of his right to trial by a jury of 12 persons, in my submission the appropriate order to make is to discharge this juror. If your Honour accepts that submission the next step in the process as I understand it is to go on and consider whether or not the trial should continue under s 53C. There is no bar to a trial proceeding with a jury of 11. There is no other reason that I can suggest that would justify the trial not proceeding. In my submission the trial should proceed with 11 jurors.

HER HONOUR: Thank you.

PROVERA: I don't wish to be heard.

HER HONOUR: Okay. All right well I think that given this juror's evidence about his commitment and that it is distracting him and given that the estimate of the trial has exceeded what the jurors were told originally his ability to perform his functions as a juror are being affected and therefore I am of the view he should not continue to act as a juror, I should discharge him but as to the matters in s 53C, I am of the view that although Mr Le will then not have 12 jurors deciding or considering his charges that there is no reason why the trial should not continue with 11 jurors so I will order the trial is to continue with 11 jurors. So I will bring that one juror in and discharge him. Yes I will just get that man brought in and tell him and then I'll bring in the rest of the jury and then they might want to go home I guess.

Just have a seat there sir in the jury box. I've decided to discharge you so thank you for the time and attention you've devoted to being a juror on the trial and you're now free to go. If you could just stay there shortly, I'll bring in the other jurors and tell them that and then the court officer might need to attend to some administrative matters with you before you actually leave, thanks.

Can you take that gentleman out and then bring in the 11 jurors please.

JURY RETURNED TO COURT AT 3.39PM

HER HONOUR: Members of the jury I have discharged one of your fellow jurors who has a commitment on Monday because that was pressing on him and I have decided that the trial will continue with the eleven of you so you can continue your deliberations just the eleven of you.

If you wish to go home now at twenty to four you can do that. If you wish to stay until 4 o'clock you can do that as well so I will leave that to you to decide.

FOREMAN: We'll stay.

HER HONOUR: Okay all right. Well I won't bring you back in then. I'll send you to the jury room and I will excuse as at four so at 4 o'clock you can go and then you - yes?

FOREMAN: Does that mean now he's been discharged from now?

HER HONOUR: Yes.

FOREMAN: So he no longer can sit on a--

HER HONOUR: Yes, yes. So it's just the eleven of you from here on in. Okay. All right.

FOREMAN: (Not transcribable).

JURY RETIRED TO FURTHER CONSIDER ITS VERDICT AT 3.40PM (SU 41 - 43) (Emphasis added)

22The jury returned with verdicts of guilty at 3:50pm. (It was not contended that there was anything significant in the timing of the verdict in relation to any of the grounds of appeal.)

Statutory provisions

23Part 7A of the Jury Act was inserted by the Jury Amendment Act 2008 and commenced operation on 1 July 2008. It contains 3 sections: s 53A is concerned with the mandatory discharge of a juror in certain circumstances; s 53B is concerned with discretionary discharge in certain circumstances; and if a juror is discharged, s 53C is concerned with the consequential need to consider whether the jury should be discharged as a whole or whether the trial should continue with a reduced number of jurors.

24The issues in this case concern ss 53B and 53C. Section 22 is also relevant. I set out below the relevant portions of each:

53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court ... may, in the course of any trial ... discharge a juror if:

...

(d) it appears to the court ... that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

53C Discretion to continue trial or coronial inquest or discharge whole jury

(1) If ... the court ... discharges a juror in the course of a trial ... the court ... must:

(a) discharge the jury if the court ... is of the opinion that to continue the trial ... with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or

(b) if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial ... continue with a reduced number of jurors.

22 Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of juror

Where in the course of any trial ... any member of the jury ... is discharged by the court ... under Part 7A, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial ... properly constituted if:

(a) in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members:

(i) is not reduced below 10,

...

and if the court ... orders that the trial ... continue with a reduced number of jurors under Part 7A.

Submissions in relation to Ground 1 (discharge of juror before the discretion was enlivened)

25The argument for the applicant in relation to this ground was presented in written submissions in succinct terms. It was contended that the note from the juror indicated that he was able to perform his function as a juror until 4pm on the Friday upon which he was discharged. He was however discharged some twenty or so minutes before then and so the conditions giving rise to the discretion to discharge the juror in s 53B(d) had not arisen. On this basis it was submitted, ""the premature discharge of the juror when there was no material before the court to enliven the court's discretionary power in s 53B(d) created a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial and created a miscarriage of justice.""

26For the Crown it was submitted that the discretion to discharge the juror was enlivened by the history of concern in the latter days of the trial about the juror's commitments and his evidence that he was ""somewhat distracted"". It was also submitted that the reasons advanced by the juror (concern about being in Malaysia the following Monday) were not an improper basis for discharge. It is notable that the applicant does not suggest otherwise. It is only the time at which he was discharged that is the issue.

Determination of Ground 1

27The contention that the judge could not discharge the juror prior to 4pm because he had indicated that he was able to perform his function as a juror until that time must be rejected. The juror had not said in express terms that he was so able until that time. Certainly that was the time he had nominated at which he sought to be excused. However, that did not put it beyond the trial judge's power to determine that prior to then there was a ""reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror"": s 53B(d). 

28The contention that ""there was no material before the court to enliven the court's discretionary power"" must also be rejected. The judge had the juror's evidence. She also had the history of concern about the juror's commitment which included the trial judge referring two days earlier to him as being ""anxious"" about his commitment. The real question raised by the applicant is whether the judge incorrectly exercised her discretion. There is no merit in the contention that she did not have the power to do so because of a lack of ""material"".

Submissions in relation to Ground 2 (error in the exercise of the discretion to discharge the juror)

29It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the discretion of the trial judge to discharge the jury miscarried under House v The King principles: House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. It was submitted that her Honour's discretion miscarried ""in a fundamental way because her Honour ignored or failed to take into account the juror's communication that he was capable of performing his function as a juror until 4pm that day"".

30It was also submitted that the ""juror in answer to the questions put by her Honour appeared to be saying his concern was an economic one, he never suggested that he could not function as a juror - at least until 4pm that day"". 

31The Crown's submissions were the same for this ground as for the previous ground. There was an evidentiary foundation for the discretion to discharge being exercised and it was open to her Honour to do so.

Determination of Ground 2

32It is important to observe that it was not contended that the juror should not have been discharged because of his commitment overseas the following week. The argument was confined to aspects relating to the time at which the discharge occurred.

33Those parts of the applicant's submissions that concern what the juror had said about his capacity to perform his function as a juror must be rejected. The juror had not said, as was asserted on behalf of the applicant, ""he was capable of performing his function as a juror until 4pm that day"". His communications were confined to his desire to be released at 4pm so as to enable him to meet his overseas commitment the following week.

34Even if it can be inferred that the juror had indicated a capacity to perform his function until 4pm, this was not binding on the judge. The question whether a juror is able to perform his or her functions is to be determined by the trial judge, not by the juror him or herself.

35For the same reasons, the contention that the questioning of the juror was ""narrow"" and that he should have been asked whether there was any impediment affecting his ability to function as a juror until 4pm must be rejected. If this question had been asked and the juror responded affirmatively, it would not have bound the judge to accept the juror's opinion.

36These submissions for the applicant ignore the fact that his own counsel at trial positively supported the idea of dealing with the individual juror's situation immediately after answering the jury's question at 3.30pm (SU 40). It also ignores the fact that, after the judge's examination of the juror, she asked counsel if they would like her to ask anything further and the applicant's counsel replied, ""No your Honour"" (SU 42). These features indicate to me that the atmosphere at the trial was such that nobody thought that it was inappropriate to discharge the juror a relatively short time prior to 4pm and that nobody thought that the juror's ability to perform his functions was completely unaffected at any moment before that time.

37The contention that the juror said in his evidence that his concern was an economic one, and that he did not say that he could not function as a juror prior to 4pm, should also be rejected. This is partly because of the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs and partly because it mischaracterises the evidence. The juror did refer to the ""hardship and consequences of not going on Monday"" but he also said that he had been ""somewhat distracted because of this"".

38The trial judge was entitled, indeed expected, to take into account more than what the juror said in his notes and in his evidence. She was required to consider the issue in the context of the trial as a whole. The critical features of that context included that: (a) it was 3.30pm on a Friday at the end of the third week of a trial originally estimated to run three or four days; (b) the jury had commenced their deliberations at 12.20pm the previous day; (c) anxiety had been expressed by a juror about being overseas the following Monday; and (d) the juror wanted to discontinue involvement in the trial by 4pm and had been assured that this would occur.

39In this context, I am not persuaded that by deciding to discharge the juror about 25 minutes before the juror had asked to be discharged the discretion in s 53(d) miscarried. 

40Other considerations support the correctness of the decision to discharge. The juror had formally asked, seemingly at 2.45pm, to be excused at 4pm but he had not had a reply. As 4pm approached, the prospect of the juror being distracted, or causing distraction, must have been an increasing possibility. The juror's evidence itself confirmed a level of distraction. 

41The jury had been together for the past three weeks, albeit not on every day. The judge had told them that if verdicts had not been reached by 4pm, the trial could continue without one juror. But as a matter of human nature, it might not have been an appealing prospect for the trial to conclude in the absence of one of their number. Such circumstances might give rise to a temptation to hasten to judgment. 

42Whether the matters I have just mentioned were part of what her Honour considered in deciding to discharge the juror is unknown. Her Honour's reasons only disclosed that she took into account his evidence of being distracted and that she had concluded ""his ability to perform his functions as a juror are being affected"" (SU 43). I propose to say something more about the adequacy of her Honour's reasons later. But for now, it is sufficient to note that the circumstances surrounding the discharge of the juror support the decision. 

43Another matter supporting the correctness of the judge's decision is that it was not only the judge, but counsel as well, who were alive to the atmosphere of the trial. It is not insignificant that trial counsel for the applicant: (a) agreed with the suggestion that the judge should deal with the situation of the juror at about 3.30pm; (b) made no suggestion that the juror should be examined further about his capacity to serve as a juror; and (c) did not wish to be heard in response to the prosecutor's submission that the juror should be discharged.

44I am not persuaded that the decision to discharge the juror involved a miscarriage of the judge's discretion. It was a decision that was well open to her. In fact, I do not believe that she could have done anything else.

Submissions in relation to Ground 3 (error of law in ordering the continuation of the trial with a reduced number of jurors)

45Once a judge has decided to discharge a juror, s 53C requires the court to give separate consideration to whether or not the trial should continue with the remaining jurors. It was contended that the trial judge had incorrectly applied the provision.

46Reference was made by counsel for the applicant to the following passage in the transcript which I have already set out above but which is convenient to repeat:

PROVERA: I don't wish to be heard.

HER HONOUR: Okay. All right well I think that given this juror's evidence about his commitment and that it is distracting him and given that the estimate of the trial has exceeded what the jurors were told originally his ability to perform his functions as a juror are being affected and therefore I am of the view he should not continue to act as a juror, I should discharge him but as to the matters in s 53C, I am of the view that although Mr Le will then not have 12 jurors deciding or considering his charges that there is no reason why the trial should not continue with 11 jurors so I will order the trial is to continue with 11 jurors. So I will bring that one juror in and discharge him. Yes I will just get that man brought in and tell him and then I'll bring in the rest of the jury and then they might want to go home I guess.

Just have a seat there sir in the jury box. I've decided to discharge you so thank you for the time and attention you've devoted to being a juror on the trial and you're now free to go. If you could just stay there shortly, I'll bring in the other jurors and tell them that and then the court officer might need to attend to some administrative matters with you before you actually leave, thanks.

47The first submission for the applicant was that her Honour had ""misapplied the terms of s 53C by deciding there were no reasons not to continue the trial with 11 jurors and making an order within the terms of s 53C(d) and s 22 of the Act before actually discharging the juror"". It was submitted that the discharge of the juror occurred when her Honour called the juror back into Court after the discussion that followed his sworn evidence and informed him, ""I've decided to discharge you"". It was submitted that her Honour had already by that time decided to continue the trial with a reduced number and made an order to that affect. Accordingly, it was submitted that her Honour had reversed the procedure in s 53C for the continuation of the trial with a reduced number of jurors. 

48Alternatively, it was submitted that her Honour erred in her application of the provisions in s 53C ""by not properly evaluating and identifying the risk factors relevant to the question of whether or not a substantial miscarriage of justice would be occasioned if the applicant's trial were to continue with a jury of 11 jurors"". It was submitted, in effect, that her Honour's statement, that there were ""no reasons why the trial should not continue with 11 jurors"", did not properly fulfil her statutory function.

49It was the contention of counsel for the applicant that s 53C(1) speaks in terms of an ""opinion"". Therefore it ""required identification and articulation of matters comprising reasons why there was not a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in continuing the [applicant's] trial with a reduced number of jurors"". It was submitted the failure to fulfil this asserted requirement ""precipitated a fundamental failure of procedure and thus a trial not according to law"".

50The Crown's submission in response to the first point was that her Honour addressed the two issues she was required to decide separately and in the correct order. Formal discharge of the juror was not necessary before her Honour considered the second issue of whether to continue with a reduced number of jurors. 

51In relation to the second point concerning an asserted failure to identify ""risk factors"", it was submitted for the Crown that not every ruling given in a trial must be accompanied by reasons. Moreover, even if there was an error in failing to give reasons, that will not necessarily amount to an error of law warranting the appeal being allowed. The Crown relied upon Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521 and BG v R [2012] NSWCCA 139. It was submitted that the question is whether the decision to continue the trial with eleven jurors gave rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, the relevant question for this Court in determining this ground of the appeal is whether the decision was the correct one, notwithstanding any inadequacy of reasons: Evans v The Queen at [246] - [247]: BG v R at [100] - [101].

52It was also submitted that no ""risk factors"" had been identified that would have led her Honour to conclude that there was a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice if the trial continued. Counsel for the applicant at trial did not suggest any to her Honour. In fact, he expressed no opposition to the continuation of the trial. 

53The Crown submitted that the trial judge's decision to continue the trial was correct, having regard to the late stage of trial at which the juror was discharged and the lack of opposition by the applicant to continuation. It was submitted that if the entire jury was discharged it would have the consequences that the entire trial would have to be re-run; the cost of the 12 days already occupied by the trial would be wasted; and the applicant, being refused bail, would likely remain in custody without bail for a longer period.

Determination of Ground 3

54It was not contended for the applicant that the decision to continue the trial with a reduced number of jurors was wrong; simply that the process by which this decision was taken was incorrect. 

55The importance of dealing separately with the two issues in Part 7A (discharge of juror and whether to continue with a reduced number of jurors) was emphasised in each of the judgments in Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; (1999) 199 CLR 99: Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [6]; McHugh J at [26]; Kirby J at [67]; and Callinan J at [103].

56As to the sequence in which her Honour dealt with the two issues, what occurred involved the following steps (contained all within about half a page of transcript (SU 43)):


(1)The trial judge stated her opinion was that the juror's ability to perform his functions as a juror was being affected and that he should be discharged.

(2)The judge then stated it was her opinion that despite the accused not having 12 jurors, there was otherwise no reason why the trial should not continue with 11, so ""I will order that the trial is to continue with 11 jurors"". (Emphasis added)

(3)The juror was informed that he was discharged.

(4)The judge then informed the remaining jurors ""I have decided that the trial will continue with the eleven of you"". (Emphasis added)

57Wu v The Queen was decided prior to the enactment of Part 7A, when the two issues were encompassed in s 22. Nothing presently turns upon this, except to understand why the reference to statutory provisions in the judgments is confined to s 22. It is important to note the practical consideration referred to by McHugh J:

[30] Furthermore, although two stages are involved in the making of a s 22 order, the first stage cannot always be separated from the second stage. Before the judge discharges a juror for illness or ""any other reason"", the judge will usually need to consider whether exercising the power of discharge has implications for the continuation of the trial with the remaining jurors. In the case of the temporary illness of a juror, the proper course will ordinarily require the temporary adjournment of the trial rather than the discharge of the jury and the making of the s 22 order. 

58The argument presented on behalf of the applicant depends upon a particular characterisation of the steps I have identified above (at [55]). In effect, it is contended that when her Honour said that the juror ""should be discharged"" (step 1), it did not constitute the discharge of the juror. That only occurred when the juror was informed that he was discharged (step 3). The statement that ""I will order that the trial is to continue with 11 jurors"" (step 2), and not the judge informing the remaining jurors that ""I have decided that the trial will continue with the eleven of you"" (step 4), represented the order made under s 53C.

59I cannot accept such a characterisation. I accept that, to some extent, there is a lack of clarity. But the reality is that two things were important; first, the judge regarded the two decisions as calling for separate consideration, and secondly, the second decision was only made after the first.

60I am satisfied that the judge gave separate consideration to the two issues and that her decision to continue the trial with a reduced number of jurors was taken only as a consequence of her decision to discharge the juror. If the judge had decided to discharge the juror because she had already decided to continue with 11 jurors, then error may have been established. But that is not what occurred. Alternatively, if she decided that the trial should continue with a reduced number of jurors as an automatic consequence of discharging the juror, error would have been established. Again, that is not what occurred.

61The fact that the two issues were dealt with in a ""leapfrogging"" fashion, as indicated by the four steps I have identified (above at [56]), does not mean that the two issues were elided or conflated, or that the second issue was decided before the first.

62The alternative submission advanced under this ground concerned her Honour's statement that she could see no reason why the trial should not continue with 11 jurors. It was contended that she should have articulated the ""risk factors relevant to the question of whether or not a substantial miscarriage of justice would be occasioned"" on the issue as to whether the trial should have continued.

63The judge referred to the applicant being deprived of 12 jurors. That was certainly an important matter that was stressed in the various judgments in Wu v The Queen. Her statement that ""as to the matters in s 53C ... there is no reason why the trial should not continue with 11 jurors"", I take to mean that she could not otherwise identify any reason why continuing the trial would risk a substantial miscarriage of justice. On forming such an opinion she was required to order the trial to continue: s 53C(1)(b).

64The Crown in this Court pointed to a number of factors militating in favour of the trial continuing with a reduced number of jurors (see above at [53]). When counsel for the applicant was pressed to articulate reasons pointing in the opposite direction he was unable to do so.

65My conclusion is that it has not been demonstrated that the decision of the trial judge to continue the trial with a reduced number of jurors was wrong.

Adequacy of trial judge's reasons

66There was some discussion at the hearing of the application concerning the adequacy of the reasons disclosed by the trial judge. The relevant passages of the transcript have been set out above. Clearly, the reasons given were brief. The critical phase occurred at about 3.30 on a Friday afternoon. It was the second day of the jury's deliberations and the judge was unaware whether they would wish to sit on or resume their deliberations the following Monday. Overlaying this was a pressing need to deal with the concerns of an individual juror who could not continue beyond the Friday. Brevity of expression in these circumstances was understandable.

67It is important, however, to observe that the issues posed by ss 53A and 53B on the one hand and s 53C on the other are important and require separate consideration, as was pointed out earlier. Lengthy reasons for decisions made under these provisions, let alone formal judgments, will rarely be necessary. But it is nonetheless important that sufficient reasons are disclosed, so that the parties are aware of the bases of the trial judge's decisions and that this Court is not left to divine from the circumstances of the trial whether a decision was correct. The latter is, in part, because it is very difficult for this Court to infer much about the atmosphere of a trial from the pages of the transcript. Formal orders being announced with some clarity is also important.

68In BG v R [2012] NSWCCA 139 the trial judge had failed to make a separate order under s 53C to continue with a reduced number of jurors and no reasons were given. A juror was discharged and the judge immediately announced, ""The jury will therefore continue as a jury of 11"". Adamson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McDougall J agreed, referred to the judgment of Heydon J in Evans v The Queen at [246] - [247] to support the proposition that a lack of reasons will not be determinative in an appeal of this kind. Rather, this Court must determine whether the continuation of the trial with a reduced number of jurors has given rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, rather than this Court reviewing a primary decision, this Court was required, in effect, to determine the issue for itself. This is unsatisfactory.

69In BG v R, Adamson J determined that there had been no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. She added the following observations about the importance of trial judges giving reasons:

[137] The trial judge's failure to address s 53C explicitly and separately from her decision to discharge a juror did not affect the result, since I have found that her Honour's decisions to discharge the juror and continue the trial with the remaining jurors were within a proper exercise of discretion. However, it is highly desirable that trial judges, when an occasion for the discharge of a juror arises, state not only the reasons for discharging a juror, or refusing to do so, but also the reasons for continuing the trial with the remaining jurors or discharging the whole jury. 

[138] Although this Court can, as it has done in the instant case, undertake the task itself of determining whether the decisions made by the trial judge are correct, or amount to a proper exercise of the discretion, it is preferable that the reasons for a trial judge's decisions on these matters are expressed. Not only do reasons assist in permitting the accused in particular to understand the basis of the decision, but they are, if expressed, available to this Court. In the absence of reasons this Court is left to infer from the circumstances of the trial what the reasons were, or might have been, if the correct question had been asked and the statutory provisions expressly addressed and considered.

70Earlier, in Wu v The Queen, Callinan J observed:

[103] I need only make this further observation. It is appropriate that a trial judge, confronted with a situation in which he or she has to make a decision about a reduction in the number of jurors not do so hastily, without as full an inquiry as is practicable and reasonable, and without making explicit orders as s 22 requires, as to the reduction in number and the continuation of the trial with the reduced number. Adherence to such a procedure (which the Act demands) has the effect not only of ensuring an unambiguous record of what has taken place but also of focussing the trial judge's attention upon the necessity to weigh up whether a juror's or jurors' absence should require the trial to be aborted or whether it should continue with the reduced number. ...

71In the present case, the reasons of the trial judge were barely adequate. My view is that they were sufficient for this Court to understand the bases for her decisions. I fully appreciate the prevailing circumstances; they were not conducive to providing extensive reasons for the decisions. The fact that there was no opposition by trial counsel for the applicant probably encouraged an economical approach by the judge. And expansive reasoning is usually not required in relation to issues concerning the discharge of jurors, or the consequential continuation or termination of trials. But it would be useful for this Court if in the future a little more attention were given to announcing formal orders, and giving brief reasons for the conclusions that led to the making of such orders.

Conclusion

72I am not persuaded that there is any merit in any of the proposed grounds of appeal. They were each technical and they ignored the practical realities of the trial. It is unfortunate that they were sought to be raised in the face of each of the decisions made by the trial judge either having the direct support of the applicant's counsel, or without his opposition.

Orders

73I propose that leave to appeal be refused.

		14 September 2012",2012-09-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760080,Regina v Tilak Neil Huon [2012] NSWSC 1092,"sentence

1Neil Tilak Huon has pleaded guilty to the charge of murder of Doreen McClelland on 24 June 2010. The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life: s 19A(1) Crimes Act 1900.

2Section 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") provides that if, by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a Court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. The maximum penalty for the offence of murder, however, remains a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence. 

3Section 54A of the Sentencing Act and Table Item 1 prescribes a standard non-parole period in respect of the offence of murder of 20 years. 

4Section 3A of the Sentencing Act states the purposes of sentencing as follows:

(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,
(c) to protect the community from the offender,
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

5The maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are two legislative guideposts which are to be borne in mind when the Court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The standard non-parole period does not have determinative significance in sentencing the offender: Muldrock at [31-32], nor is it a ""starting point"" for the sentence nor does it directly apply as the offender has pleaded guilty.

Background
6On 29 June 2010 the Offender was arrested and charged with the murder of Doreen McClelland in her home on or about 24 June 2010.

7The Offender has remained in continuous custody since 29 June 2010. 

8He was committed for trial from the Central Local Court on 20 October 2011. He first appeared for arraignment before this Court on 4 November 2011. The Crown was informed on 5 April 2012 that a plea would be entered once the results of an MRI examination were received by the defence. On 4 May 2012, the Offender entered a plea of guilty to the offence of murder following the receipt of the results of that examination.

9The Offender had a previous conviction for an offence of ""malicious wounding"". The sentence was imposed on 18 April 2007 whereby the Offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years with a non-parole period of 15 months. That assault was an unprovoked attack by the offender upon the face of a woman with a broken bottle causing a 12-centimetre laceration.

10It was the Crown's submission that, in all the circumstances of this case, which include the Offender's psychiatric condition, a substantial term of fulltime custody is required to address the issue of future dangerousness.

The evidence
11At the sentence hearing, evidentiary materials were tendered on behalf of the Crown and the Offender. The Crown tendered a number of documents which are contained in the folder which became Exhibit A in the proceedings. That exhibit contained an Agreed Statement of Facts.

12Mr G Walsh, solicitor, appeared on behalf of the Offender. He tendered a considerable volume of material including in particular medical reports. A folder containing the material was admitted and became Exhibit 1. The report of Dr Andrew White dated 17 July 2012 was separately tendered and it became Exhibit 2 in the proceedings.

13At the sentence hearing, Victim Impact Statements of Kay Morris, Robert McClelland and Janet Huon, were read.

The facts
14The Offender was born on 17 August 1987 in a shanty town near Colombo, Sri Lanka. He was accordingly 23 years of age at the date of the offence and is presently 26 years of age. He was adopted by Janet and Dennis Huon as a young child. The deceased, Doreen McClelland, was 80 years of age at the date of the offence. She was Janet Huon's mother.

15The facts as to the events concerning the offence and to which I will now refer are based on the Statement of Facts in Exhibit A.

16At about 7:30PM on Thursday 24 June 2010, the Offender drove his vehicle to the deceased's home at Peakhurst. He knocked on the sliding glass door and the deceased opened it for him.

17He remained at the premises watching television with the deceased for a few hours. He consumed in that period two cups of Scotch whisky and Coke. He concealed the fact that he was drinking that liquid by using a coffee cup.

18At some point between 7:30PM and 10:45PM the Offender assaulted the deceased causing her death. This occurred where Mrs McClelland was sitting in a single armchair in the lounge room. The Offender had obtained a knife from the kitchen and he stabbed the deceased with it in the left cheek with the blade becoming embedded and the handle snapping off.

19On Friday 25 June 2010, Janet Huon attended the deceased's home. She was unable to locate the deceased and upon searching the premises located her mother inside the walk-in wardrobe of her bedroom.

20The Offender received a call from his mother at about 5:30PM in which he was informed that his grandmother had passed away. He thereafter joined family members at the deceased's residence.

21Police arrived at about 6:50PM and set up a crime scene.

22A post-mortem was performed on the deceased on Saturday 26 June 2010 by Dr Rebecca Irvine. Dr Irvine determined that the cause of death was asphyxia. Occlusion of the outer airways was the most likely mechanism.

23Whilst the position of the knife blade was not believed to have caused a haemorrhagic complication, it was considered by the forensic pathologist that it may have contributed to asphyxia by reason of its position in relation to the base of the tongue.

24Dr Irvine's findings indicated that the deceased's body had been moved from a prior position to the final position in the wardrobe.

25Police investigations established that at 10:46PM on Thursday 24 June 2010, CCTV footage revealed the Offender entered the Mortdale Hotel where he played poker machines and consumed drinks. At 11:11PM, he was recorded as accessing an ATM machine in the Hotel, attempting to withdraw funds from the deceased's credit card account. At 11:14PM a further attempt was made at an ATM nearby to the Hotel. At 11:21PM, a balance check was made at another ATM machine near the Hotel.

26The Offender returned to the deceased's home where he used local papers to ascertain brothels that provided callout services. He made a number of calls and made a booking providing credit card details using the deceased's credit card account. A sex worker attended between 1:00AM and 2:00AM on Friday 25 June 2010. An amount of $330 was charged on the deceased's card for sexual services. 

27The Offender phoned another two escort agencies. A sex worker attended the deceased's premises between about 3:10AM and 4:10AM. The Offender again used the deceased's credit card and an amount of $308 was charged against the account.

28The Offender left the premises and arrived home at about 4:30AM where he lived with his parents. He was awoken at 6:00AM and driven to his workplace. He was later collected by his father at 4:00PM and driven home. The Offender washed his clothes that he had worn the previous evening. 

29He was arrested at 3:30PM on Tuesday 29 June 2010. He participated in an electronically recorded interview. He told police that he had gone to the deceased's home on the evening of 24 June 2010. He recalled being in the kitchen with her and from then on ""everything's a blur"". He told police:

That he could not recall leaving the deceased's home; 
That he did not touch her handbag; 
That he did not go to the bank that evening; 
That he denied returning to his grandmother's home after he left.

30On being shown the CCTV footage the Offender then told police that he had removed his grandmother's credit card from the kitchen while he was visiting her. He said that he made a number of unsuccessful attempts to withdraw cash from the account before disposing of the card in a bin. After being told by police that the credit card was found in the office at the deceased's residence, the Offender said that he had replaced the card in the office on attending the deceased's home with other family members, after learning of her death. He denied killing or assaulting the deceased.

31Police later executed a search warrant at his home. Clothing worn by the deceased depicted in the CCTV footage was seized including a pair of sneakers which family members had observed to have been washed by the Offender some time prior to 11:00AM on Sunday 27 June 2010.

32I make findings of fact in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the Offender.

Personal history of the Offender
33The Offender attended primary and secondary school in Sydney. He was a below average student but participated in a number of sports, in particular rugby, cricket and athletics.

34In Year 10 he underwent an IQ test and as a result he received additional teaching support.

35In June 2004, when the Offender was in Year 11, it was decided that he would leave school, as he was not progressing academically. Between July - December 2004, he completed a Commercial Cookery Certificate II with credits and was nominated for Student of the Year.

36On 4 September 2004, he cut himself. This was the first of what was said to be a number of serious episodes of self-cutting in an extensive history of self-harm.

37On 7 September 2004, the Offender attended Interrelate Family Life Counselling. This followed concerns over the self-harming incident. He attended a second time in September 2004.

38In February 2005, he obtained employment at a Sydney restaurant for 8 weeks. He had considerable difficulties working there due to comments about his ethnicity.

39He cut himself regularly between September 2004 and June 2005 and was consuming alcohol to excess. On 15 June 2005, he cut himself badly and was taken by his parents to see Ms Katy Vidler, psychologist.

40On 18 July 2005, Ms Vidler prescribed Efexor XR 75mg for the Offender. Due to the complexity of his subjective problems, he was referred to Dr Hugh Morgan, psychiatrist. A number of reports by Dr Morgan are contained in Exhibit 1.

41On 31 August 2005, the Offender cut himself very badly and was treated at St George Hospital. The history of self-mutilation was noted as was the fact that he was suffering from depression. He was prescribed the drug Zoloft. A diagnosis of depression and borderline personality disorder was recorded.

42Dr Morgan noted in his report of 4 August 2005 that he had decided to change the Offender's medication from Efexor XR to Lovan.

43Ms Vidler, in July 2005, diagnosed the Offender as suffering from a generalised anxiety disorder, a major depressive disorder ""recurrent severe without psychotic features, with comorbid self-harm behaviours"": Report 19 July 2005 at p 3.

44In December 2005, the Offender was again involved in a very serious cutting incident and was treated at St George Hospital in the Acute Mental Section. On 17 March 2006, the Offender was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and then to the St George Acute Mental Health Team. He gave a history of being sexually assaulted by a man dressed as a woman. He was referred to Dr John Albert Roberts, consultant psychiatrist, for assessment in June 2006. Dr Roberts arranged for a cerebral CT scan to be performed on 6 June 2006. The report on the scans stated: 

""There is a possibly mild degree of cerebral atrophy present. No other focal lesion is seen."" 

45An MRI examination was performed. Dr Roberts stated that the MRI was indicative of an abnormal brain. He considered it could be congenital or acquired as a result of alcohol and other substance abuse or both.

46Dr Roberts noted that the offender had an IQ of 80-89 being ""low average"".

47Dr Roberts identified a number of problems in the Offender including developmental delay with what he considered to be proven cerebral atrophy (presumably on the basis of the MRI examination), psychiatric illness associated with depressive moods and substance abuse disorder, namely alcoholism. These conditions, he considered, interacted to cause the Offender to be more vulnerable to what he referred to as the disinheriting effects of alcohol. 

48This diagnosis was made following the offence to which I have earlier referred. It occurred on 21 April 2006 when the Offender, after having heavily consumed alcohol, attacked a female at Kings Cross. He claimed to have had little recollection of the incident.

49In June 2006 the Offender went to Wandene Private Hospital for intensive assessment under the care of Professor Saunders and Dr Grace, psychiatrist. Between July and October 2006 he entered an Alcohol Abuse Program conducted by Professor Saunders. He was also placed on medication for the self-harm problem.

50Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, has assessed the Offender on two separate occasions. He initially assessed him for the purposes of the sentence hearing in relation to the Kings Cross malicious wounding offence and in September 2010 for the purposes of the present proceedings. He diagnosed the Offender in 2006 with low-grade developmental disability, major depressive illness and an alcohol abuse disorder. Dr Nielssen, however, considered the Offender was fit to plead and was fit for trial.

51Dr Nielssen's report of 21 November 2006 is included amongst medical evidence in Exhibit 1 in the present proceedings. Dr Nielssen in that report stated at p 6:

""The diagnosis of low-grade developmental disability is based on the history of poor fine motor skills and learning problems throughout his upbringing, despite what seemed to be a supportive and enriched environment and access to remedial teaching. His developmental disorder is manifested in low average intelligence with limited capacity for the kind of conceptual thinking needed for some forms of insight orientated counselling and problem solving in stressful situations.""

52Dr Nielssen observed in 2006 that as a result of consistent treatment with anti-depressant medication and counselling and 6 months' abstinence from alcohol, there had been signs of improvement. 

53In relation to the alcohol abuse disorder he recorded a history of hazardous intake of alcohol. He said that the complications of alcohol abuse included what he termed ""amnestic episodes"". He had amnesia for the malicious wounding offence which he said was consistent with alcoholic amnestic episodes or ""blackout"".

54Dr Roberts provided a report dated 13 December 2006 in which he identified three features as relevant to the malicious wounding offence:
1. Brain damage.
2. Pre-existing psychiatric illness associated with self-harm.
3. The possible interaction of Zoloft with cerebral atrophy and alcohol excess.

55In his report of 11 July 2012, tendered in relation to the subject offence, he stated that psychopathy is a sub-type of antisocial Personality Disorder. It was not an illness that would satisfy the M'Naghten test or rule. In that respect he observed that the Offender knew at the time of committing the offence as to what he was doing and that he understood that what he was doing was wrong but that his understanding would have been ""in the abstract"".

56Dr Roberts in his initial report had recorded a history of the Offender's heavy consumption of alcohol from the age of 15, which would have produced brain damage. Dr Roberts said that the Offender told him that he had no recollection of the attack upon the deceased. He, however, said that he remembered being at the Hotel. He said that he could not believe what had happened and he had loved his grandmother. Dr Roberts opined:

""He has a cluster of psychopathologic entities including the Axis I diagnosis of Substance Abuse Disorder and an Axis II diagnosis of a Personality Disorder of the antisocial personality type.

Other factors, including cerebral deterioration, chromosomal abnormalities, the Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome and epilepsy should all be considered as possible contributing factors.

This is a complex case and in my view all evidence should be before the Court.""

57On 3 April 2012 a report on a second MRI scan was received. It was to the effect that the brain stem and cerebellum showed no abnormalities. This result is accordingly inconsistent with the initial MRI, to which I have referred. 

58In his report dated 11 July 2012, Dr Roberts stated that the appropriate diagnosis was ""psychopathy"" and that he would have had virtually no emotional response to killing his grandmother. 

59The offender was treated by Dr Deepinder Miller, consultant psychiatrist, from 28 April 2010 until 23 June 2010. In the detailed history taken from the Offender, Dr Miller noted the following:
1. A sense of abandonment by his biological mother and society in general;
2. A significant pattern of self-loathing and self-hate that manifested itself in significant deliberate self-harming behaviour.
3. A lack of empathy towards others with feelings of uncontrollable rage and an impulse to harm others.

Submissions
60In the written submissions for the Offender, Mr Walsh conceded that the attack upon the deceased was entirely an unprovoked and vicious one involving an elderly and vulnerable woman. 

61He submitted that it was a difficult task to assess the objective seriousness of the criminality of the Offender due to a combination of circumstances. Whilst it was conceded that the crime was a callous one Mr Walsh submitted that based on the nature of the wound caused by the Offender it could be concluded that he did not have an intention to kill but an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or that he acted with reckless indifference to human life. In that respect Mr Walsh referred to the cause of death as determined by Dr Irvine, namely asphyxia by occlusion of the outer airways as well as haemorrhage within the soft tissues anterior to the spinal column of the neck suggestive of hyperextension of the neck. This was said to have contributed to the asphyxia.

62Mr Walsh acknowledged that the Offender's level of intoxication is not a matter which can be properly taken into account by way of mitigation. It was observed in that respect, however, that it may provide an explanation for irrational behaviour. It was also submitted that it could support the contention that the offence was unplanned, unpremeditated and spontaneous. In that respect, reference was made to the remarks on sentence in R v Sheather [2011] NSWSC 1239. In that case, Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) stated that, on the day the offence of murder was committed, the offender in that case had consumed a considerable quantity of alcohol and three cones of cannabis. His Honour noted that the circumstances of the offence, together with the very intoxicated state of the offender, made it clear that the offence was unplanned and unpremeditated and occurred as a spur-of-the-moment act. Nonetheless, it was also clear in that case that the offender had a determination to use knives against the deceased.

63Mr Walsh also referred to the observations of Johnson J in R v MJR [2010] NSWSC 653 at [67] and [68]. There, his Honour noted that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime of murder there under consideration involved: 

""... consideration of facts which relate directly to the commission of the offence, including those which may explain why it was committed and which bear upon the Offender's moral culpability.""

64There is a need to closely assess the facts established in the evidence in the present proceedings in determining whether the offence was an unplanned, unpremeditated or spontaneous act, as Mr Walsh submitted.

65On the Offender's behalf it was submitted that he appeared to have an otherwise good relationship with his adoptive grandmother. There was no suggestion that he had broken into her house although it was conceded that, owing to the relationship with his grandmother he would have easily been able to gain access to the home. Significantly, Mr Walsh observed, there did not appear to be any evidence that the Offender had planned to murder the deceased and it may well have been a spontaneous but callous attack.

66Mr Walsh conceded that the use of a knife to inflict a wound upon the deceased's cheek was an aggravating factor in terms of s 28A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act.

67In relation to the Offender's previous conviction for the offence of malicious wounding, Mr Walsh relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253 for the proposition that a previous conviction for such an offence was relevant, not to increase the objective seriousness of the offence committed, but rather that ""retribution, deterrence and protection of society would indicate a more severe sentence is warranted"": R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76; R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2002) 66 NSWLR 566.

68The decision in McNaughton, supra, establishes: 

1. That the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions

2. Prior convictions are pertinent to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie, particularly with reference to an attitude of disobedience of the law and to the increased weight to be given to retribution, deterrence (relevantly personal deterrence) and protection of society.""

69Mr Walsh conceded that an aggravating circumstance of the offence under s 21A(eb) of the Sentencing Act was the fact that the offence occurred in the victim's home and she was elderly.

70It was also acknowledged that the offence was committed in circumstances in which the offender's grandmother's credit cards were used: an offence committed for financial gain is an aggravating factor under s 21A(o) of the Sentencing Act.

71Mr Walsh submitted that in terms of s 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act the offender had demonstrated remorse. He had written to Kay Morris, daughter of Doreen McClelland and Robert McClelland, the son of Mrs McClelland. In the letter he expressed shame, shock and disgust and his disbelief for what he had done and the suffering he had caused. He also expressed sorrow and remorse to his mother and father and sister. He told Dr Roberts that he dearly loved his grandmother and that the commission of the offence was against his nature.

72Mr Walsh submitted that the guilty plea had been entered at the earliest practicable opportunity having regard to the Offender's complex psychiatric history. Dr Roberts' final report, Mr Walsh noted, was dated 11 July 2012. It was submitted that, in all the circumstances of the case, it was appropriate that a discount is allowed for the Offender's plea.

73In the submissions made on his behalf, Mr Walsh emphasised a number of factors relating to what he termed ""a most unusual and complex subjective background"": Written Submissions at [118].

74Reference was made to the well-established principles applying in the sentencing of an offender who suffers from a mental disability or incapacity. Those principles were summarised in R v Pitt [2005] NSWCCA 304 at [22]. These include:

1. Sentencing persons who suffer from mental disorders confronts judicial officers with the need to make a sensitive discretionary decision: Regina v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 per Gleeson CJ.

2. Where deterrence of others is of lesser importance in a case of an offender who suffered a mental illness, it may however mean that protection of society is of greater importance or might at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the Offender himself or herself; Engert, supra, at 68 per Gleeson CJ.

Consideration
75The Court may not take facts into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of the Offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are matters which the Offender relies upon in mitigation of penalty, it is enough if those matters are proved by the offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27]-[28].

76In the context of criminal responsibility cognitive deficits or mental illness may be relevant in one or more ways. Mental impairment may have a direct causal link to the relevant offending. It may have an indirect link. In some cases although there may have been an absence of a causal association, such impairment or mental illness may affect an offender's mental functioning at the time of the offence or in the lead-up to it.

77An offender's cognitive functioning is part of his or her subjective circumstances. It may reduce his or her moral culpability for the offence, it may reduce the role of general and/or specific deterrence in the sentencing exercise. It can in some cases render the term of imprisonment to be served more onerous.

78Whether mental illness or disorder does any or all of these things depends upon the nature and severity of the alleged mental condition. The point is that, provided it is factored into the sentencing exercise, it allows for the imposition of a sentence that is commensurate with both objective and subjective circumstances. 

79It was not submitted by Mr Walsh, nor could it have been, that the Offender's mental health disorders were directly causative of the offence. Rather the submission was that those matters are to be taken into account in the assessment of the Offender's subjective case. In that context the submission was the Offender's mental disability or incapacity is an important factor to be considered: Written Submission for the Offender at [118] and [119]. 

80The medical evidence establishes that the Offender suffered from a number of interrelated psychiatric conditions that became increasingly problematic over a period of at least 6 years between 2004 and the date of the offence, 24 June 2010. These included an anxiety and depressive condition, an antisocial Personality Disorder, a substance abuse disorder and self-harm behaviours.

81The Offender had a history of periodic binge drinking related to his substance abuse disorder. Dr Miller noted that over a period of months in 2005 when she treated him she had attempted to decrease his alcohol consumption during the period of her treatment of him. In that regard she noted that he only binge drank on two occasions. Both of these occasions Dr Miller noted were reported to her at the time that each occurred. This history Dr Miller noted was confirmed by the Offender's mother's account.

82Accordingly, in the months preceding the offence the Offender had demonstrated an effort under specialist medical supervision, to do something about reducing his alcohol consumption. He was partly successful in doing so for a period. According to his account to Dr Roberts he finished work early on the day of the offence and said that he ""let my guard down"" and consumed a large quantity of various forms of alcohol during the afternoon and evening of the offence. His account in that regard is consistent with the evidence, in particular that of Dr Miller.

83As to the Offender's consumption of alcohol on the day of the offence, whilst it presents as a voluntary course of action, is to be seen in the context of his long-standing alcohol abuse disorder which in turn may be seen in context with the anxiety and depressive conditions for which he received treatment in the years preceding the offence. That said, he having previous knowledge of the effects that excessive alcohol could have on him, it cannot be said that he was free of responsibility for his level of intoxication in the lead-up to the callous and tragic attack upon the deceased. 

84Dr Nielssen noted the prior history of the Offender's criminal offending behaviour in 2006 occurred whilst he was heavily intoxicated.

85Dr Nielssen in that same report noted that in relation to the offence, the subject of these proceedings, the Offender was affected by a moderate amount of alcohol at the time of the offence and that the Offender said that he could not recall it. Dr Nielssen, however, observed that he was able to drive his car to his grandmother's house and was also able to later find his way to a nearby hotel and back. The Crown submitted that this is relevant to the issue of whether the Offender had an intention to kill. His account of complete amnesia of the events, Dr Nielssen noted, was not consistent with a typical alcoholic blackout which would normally be associated with blood alcohol levels that are too high for many forms of purposeful behaviour. Dr Nielssen's analysis, accordingly, throws doubt on the Offender's account to a number of examining doctors as to having had a complete absence of memory in relation to the offence. This comment also applied to certain of his answers to police in the ERISP conducted on 29 June 2010. 

86Although the Offender suffered from a significant level of psychiatric disability, Dr Nielssen concluded, like Dr Roberts, that he did not have a mental illness that would be considered in law to be a disease of the mind such as to provide him with a mental illness defence.

87The reports of the psychiatrists in this case do not establish a direct causal link between a particular diagnosed mental disorder in the Offender and the offence. Dr Roberts, however, did observe in his report of 11 July 2012 that he considered that there was evidence of ""disordered brain function"".

88I have concluded that the opinions expressed in the psychiatric reports as to the mental health issues concerning the Offender are to be taken into account as operating as relevant subjective matters in determining the sentence to be imposed.

89I have taken into consideration the question of motive in terms of financial advantage to the Offender in the commission of the crime. Whilst at least at some point during the evening of the offence, the offender determined upon using his grandmother's credit card, the evidence does not permit a conclusion, to the required standard, that he entered her home solely with that purpose in mind. 

90I have also taken into account the Offender's age, namely, as earlier noted, 26 years. His age at the time of the offence and his level of maturity are matters also to be taken into account. 

91In determining the sentence to be imposed specific deterrence is an important factor to be taken into account, as is the protection of the community from the Offender. I have considered both. Finally, I have also borne in mind the need for the promotion of the Offender's rehabilitation in determining sentence. 

The issue of criminal intent
92The principal issue on which the Crown's submissions differed from those on behalf of the Offender was whether or not the Offender's attack upon the deceased was undertaken with an intent to kill or whether, as submitted on behalf of the Offender, the attack upon the deceased was done with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life.

93The Crown's submissions referred in particular to the use of a weapon, namely the knife, and the nature of the stabbing wound using that knife inflicted by the Offender. The Crown observed that the stabbing produced a wound track of 8.1cm. The Crown also observed that either before or after the stabbing the deceased's head was pulled backwards. These facts, it was submitted by the Crown, indicated that an attack upon an 80-year-old woman while seated would have been undertaken with an intent to kill.

94The Crown referred to relevant authorities. In R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; 124 A Crim R 451 at [34] it was held that the defence involving an intent to kill is generally more serious than one involving an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. However, as the Crown also observed in R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312; 164 A Crim R 252, the Court held that although it will generally be the case that the intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill, that is not always the case. 

95In Hillsley and in R v Nelson (unreported 25 June 1996, NSWCCA) decisions to which the Crown referred, it was noted that there may be circumstances in a particular case where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm could reflect similar criminality to other cases involving an intention to kill. 

96I have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the Crown and the Offender on this issue. I have concluded that the nature of the wound caused by the Offender does not, in the whole of the circumstances of the case, support a conclusion that the Offender's intention was only to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim.

97An examination of Dr Irvine's very detailed report including, in particular at pages 3 and 5, would, in my assessment, support beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender at the time of the attack intended to kill her. Support for that conclusion is to be found in Dr Irvine's detailed analysis concerning the nature and location and depth of the knife wound in conjunction with the haemorrhage to the soft tissue anterior to the spinal column of the neck. On Dr Irvine's analysis, it is consistent with forceful action, described as hyperextension of the neck. Dr Irvine noted that that wound is consistent with the deceased having been seated in the lounge room with the level of hyperextension, as described in the report, producing contusion on the chin. The nature and location of the stab wound together with the forced hyperextension of the neck requiring forceful action supports the conclusion that the Offender acted with the intention to kill.

98That conclusion, of course, is a material matter in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the criminality of the Offender.

99It is not possible to conclude on the evidence, to the required standard, that the offender had an intention to kill the victim before entering her home. That intention I find was formed at some later point in time.

Aggravating factors
100I have earlier referred to the submissions of Mr Walsh in relation to the aggravating features relied upon by the Crown. The Crown submitted that the following are aggravating features pursuant to s 21A(2) (of the Sentencing Act):

The offence involved the actual use of a weapon; s 21A(2)(c) 
The Offender has a record of previous convictions particularly for serious personal violence; s 21A(2)(d) 
The offence was committed in the home of the victim; s 21A(eb) 
The victim was vulnerable because she was very old; s 21A(1) 
The offence was committed for financial gain; s 21A(o)

101I accept the Crown's submissions as to the aggravating factors.

Prior offending
102In relation to the Offender's criminal record, as Mr Walsh, observed the offence of malicious wounding committed by the Offender in 2006 involved a violent attack upon a vulnerable victim whilst the Offender was grossly affected by alcohol.

103In Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465, the High Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) observed:

""The principal for proportionality is now firmly established in this country. It was the unanimous view of the Court in Veen (No 1) that a sentence should not be increased beyond what is proportionate to the crime in order merely to extend the period of protection of society from the risk of recidivism on the part of the offender."" (At 472)

A little later the Court observed:

""It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventative detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of a sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors which is permissible."" 

104Prior convictions are pertinent as to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie, particularly by reference to an attitude of disobedience of the law and to the increased weight to be given to retribution, deterrence (relevantly personal deterrence) and the protection of society: R v McNaughton, supra, at [25] per Spigelman CJ.

105An assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime of murder in this case involves a consideration of the facts to which I have referred that relate directly to the commission of the offence, including those which may explain why it was committed and in particular those which bear upon the Offender's moral culpability.

106The Crown submitted that the aspect of future dangerousness is relevant in this case. In that respect reference was made to the observations of the High Court in Veen v R (no 2) set out above at [103]. 

107The Crown submitted that the protection of society is of paramount importance in this case in the light of the Offender's history and psychiatric condition. It was noted that he had, over the years, been prescribed a number of drugs and had attended counselling, including an alcohol treatment program.

108The Crown submitted that in the circumstances I should make a positive finding in relation to future dangerousness. The Crown submitted that the Offender had a history of vicious attacks upon women and that the Offender had had the opportunity of extensive ongoing treatment but notwithstanding that he committed the crime, subject of the present proceedings. These factors along with Dr Roberts' diagnosis establishes, the Crown submitted, ""an ongoing danger to society"". 

General and specific deterrence
109I have concluded that the mental health disorders that existed both prior to and at the time of the commission of the offence renders the Offender less suitable to be a medium for general deterrence. It is unclear on the material presently available as to what the longer term future will hold for him in terms of his future custody, there being little evidence on that subject. To be balanced with these considerations is the need to protect the public in the future, and the need also for appropriate treatment and support to prepare the Offender for his future release into the community. I have taken all of these matters into consideration in determining sentence in accordance with the principles in R v Engert, supra, at 70-71 and R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at [92] - [118].

110I have earlier referred to the evidence as to the Offender's contrition and remorse for his crime which I accept to be a genuine expression by him. References in the medical reports confirm the depth of his contrition and remorse. I take that into account.

111The various histories contained in the medical reports reveal that the Offender's adoptive family has throughout provided a very supportive home environment including care for his upbringing and welfare. That fact, of course, highlights the absolute tragedy of the crime in this case. It also, to a point, emphasises the complexity of the Offender's mental health issues that have affected him since at least 2004 and the need for an ongoing requirement for support, medical and otherwise, for the Offender in the future. 

112Dr Miller concluded in her report:

""Whatever the outcome of the current legal proceedings against Mr Huon, he will require ongoing psychodynamic psychotherapy and possibly a mood stabiliser such as Quetiapine in order to decrease his mood lability, decrease his self-harming behaviour and to address his sense of cultural and actual abandonment ..."" 

113The Offender is presently held in custody in the mental health accommodation area of the relevant correctional institution. The report, dated 17 July 2012, of Dr Andrew White, who is employed by Justice Health, states that his behaviour whilst in custody has never given rise to concern and that he had been pleasant and polite on all interactions with staff. Dr White additionally stated that he is respected by staff who appreciate the amount of help that he has given in looking after the acutely unwell and vulnerable people in the relevant accommodation area. With antidepressant and anti anxiety drug treatment there has been improvement in the level of the Offender's anxiety. It is clear, however, from Dr White's report that it is not likely that there will be a pharmacological cure for the Offender's condition. He is stated to have recognised this and has undertaken as much counselling as is possible where he has been held. He sees the Chaplain for regular sessions and has undertaken a program with him. I have noted references from the Crossroad Bible Institute, Australia dated 27 April 2012 and credit certificates which attest to the Offender's willingness to undertake and complete lessons as part of a biblical correspondence course. 

114The positive reports from staff members in relation to the Offender's behaviour and the observation that he is endeavouring to understand his problems provides, according to Dr White, a basis for a prognosis that is more positive than the average both in terms of understanding his problems and seeking to avoid harmful conduct in the future.

115However the evidence does not presently enable me to conclude that the Offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. That said, prospects for his improvement do exist although at this point they must, on the medical evidence to date, be considered to be guarded. 

116I have earlier set out the purposes of sentencing. In some cases, including the present, there are difficult and competing considerations that are relevant to sentence. The offence committed by the Offender, of course, is a very serious one and a significant sentence of imprisonment must be imposed.

117In determining sentence, I have taken into account the evidence relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, the Offender's previous conviction for a serious personal violence offence and the subjective circumstances of the Offender as referred to in these remarks on sentence.

118There is, in my opinion, a need for an element of specific deterrence in the sentence. I also give weight to the protection of the community. I have kept in mind the principle of proportionality and the sentence is not to be increased beyond that which is proportionate to the crime: Veen (No 2).

Victim Impact Statements
119I have referred earlier to the Victim Impact Statements of Kay Morris and Janet Huon, the deceased's daughters and Robert McClelland, son of the deceased. The contents of the statements, eloquently expressed, cannot be used by me to increase the Offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and I express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.

120At the outset of these remarks, I stated that the maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).

The Offender's plea of guilty
121In relation to sentence, I have regard to the Offender's plea of guilty. I have referred earlier to the fact that the Offender pleaded guilty on 4 May 2012, noting the timing of Dr Roberts' final report (dated on 11 July 2012.

122The discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is to be determined largely by the timing of the plea.

123I assess the discount to be allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty in this case at 20 per cent. 

124There has been no application for a finding of special circumstances which justifies the balance of the term of the sentence as exceeding one third of the non-parole period but I do not in any event consider that special circumstances could be said to exist.

125Tilak Neil Huon, for the murder of Doreen McClelland, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, which is to commence on 29 June 2010 and is to expire on 28 June 2026 with a balance of term of 5 years which is to commence on 29 June 2026 and to expire on 28 June 2031.

126The earliest date that the Offender is eligible for release to parole is 28 June 2026.

Order
127The Offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, which is to commence on 29 June 2010 and is to expire on 28 June 2026 and a balance of term of 5 years which is to commence on 29 June 2026 and to expire on 28 June 2031.

128The earliest date that the Offender is eligible for release to parole is 28 June 2026.

The facts

10The applicant gave evidence on sentencing, accepting what was indicated in the agreed statement of facts, that he was the head of the syndicate. The applicant obtained compromised credit card data from various sources, which he supplied to Kha Weng Foong, who produced high quality credit cards and Medicare cards, which he later collected. He also provided fictitious names to Henley Han, who produced false identity documents, including NSW drivers licenses, which he then also collected.

11Quoc Du Hua was the applicant's peer in the syndicate. He made arrangements with the applicant as to the workings of the syndicate and negotiated the exchange of goods and money with the applicant. Yung Feng Yun was one of the supervisors of the shoppers to whom the applicant supplied the false identity and credit cards. The shoppers made purchases, which they handed to Yun, who waited in a car parked nearby. Sock Meng Kee supervised another group of shoppers and remitted money overseas for the applicant.

12The applicant's daughter, Mei Ch'eng (Mary) Che received proceeds from the use of false identity and credit cards provided by the applicant in Victoria. Bing Xian Yeoh supervised a group of shoppers in Victoria and collected goods which he handed to her in return for payment.

13The Facts relevant to each offence to which his Honour referred in his sentencing remarks were:

""Offence 1 - Conspiracy to make false Instruments with Foong

10.The offender conspired with Foong to make false
instruments between 18 February 2009 to 1 July 2009. During this
period Foong acquired the material and machinery required to
produce high quality false credit cards. At the request of the offender Foong used these materials and machinery to manufacture false credit cards which he subsequently provided to the offender in return for a financial reward.

11.The offender subsequently provided the false credit cards manufactured by Foong to supervise the various groups of shoppers in Sydney and Melbourne. The supervisors included Kee and Yun in Sydney and Che and Yeoh in Melbourne. The ""shoppers"" used the credit cards to purchase valuable goods from various retail outlets. The goods purchased included laptop computers, mobile phone recharge cards, postage stamps, tobacco, liquor and perfume, which were easy to resell. The offender subsequently received the goods or proceeds from the reselling of the goods. The offender provided many of the goods to Hua in return for payment.

12.During the period of conspiracy the offender regularly received the details of compromised credit card data including credit card numbers and card holder numbers via SMS from a male person known as Kwan Seong Wong in Spain and from other contacts in Malaysia and Australia. The offender regularly forwarded this data to Foong and the offender [sic Han] to enable them to manufacture the false credit cards and identification documents. The offender visited Foong's residence in Kings Cross on a number of occasions to collect the manufactured credit cards. On other occasions Foong sent batches of completed credit cards to the offender by Australia Post. 

Offence number 2 - Conspiracy to make false instruments

19.The offender conspired with Han to make false instruments between 18 February 2009 and 1 July 2009. During this period Han sourced the materials and machinery required to produce high quality false identification documents including New South Wales driver's licences. At the request of the offender, Han used these materials and machinery to manufacture false identification documents which he subsequently provided to the offender in return for a financial reward.

20.The offender subsequently provided the false identification documents manufactured by Han and false credit cards manufactured by Foong to supervisors of various groups of ""shoppers"" in Sydney and Melbourne. Supervisors including Kee and Yun in Sydney and Che and Yeoh in Melbourne. Shoppers used the credit cards and identification documents to purchase valuable goods from various retail outlets.

30. Yeoh was an integral part of the criminal enterprise led by the offender which involved the fraudulent use of credit card data without consent owned by financial institutions based locally and abroad. Yeoh purchased goods using credit cards supplied to him through the operation of a syndicate led by the offender. Each card was used to obtain property worth an average $200 to $300. However, occasionally a card was used to purchase property over $2,000.

37. During the course of this conspiracy the offender also maintained regular contact with Che. On 2 March 2009 the offender telephoned Che and discussed whether the ""mailbags"" had been sold yet as he needed to pay for forged credit cards. The offender said, ""There are thirty mailbags with stocks worth about $14,000."" Che and the offender discussed extensive details of their business in a telephone call on 20 May 2009. On 21 May 2009 the offender sent a series of SMS messages to Che detailing various goods including laptop computers and prices. The offender asked Che to transfer $2,700 to an ANZ account on 23 May 2009. On 24 May 2009, the offender asked Che if it was okay to sell the Rolex watch. Che said it was. The offender instructed Che to send it to him.

Yun subsequently met the offender and provided goods to the offender.

Offence number 6 - Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime between 18 February 2009 and 1 July 2009

53.During the period of the conspiracies referred to above between 18 February 2009 and 1 May 2009 the offender received goods purchased with false credit cards from various members of the shopping syndicates involved in the criminal enterprise led by the offender. These included retail gift cards, tobacco, mobile telephone recharge cards, perfumes, electronic goods, alcohol and jewellery. The offender negotiated the exchange of some ..of these goods for money with Hua.

54.When the offender's premises were searched on 1 July 2009, police located: numerous gift cards from David Jones, Bunnings, Myer, K-Mart and elsewhere; thirteen mobile telephones; a number of SIM cards; two laptop computers; a Rolex watch; numerous bottles of Johnny Walker blue, black and green label; Hennessy and Remy and Martin Cognac and Jack Daniels Bourbon, two cartons of Winfield Blue cigarettes and a Rolex watch.

Offence Number 7 - Having custody of false instruments on 25 June 2009

55. This charge arises out of the events referred to on 25 June 2009. Foong was observed to place a number of small white packages into his letter box at 5/5 - 7 Earl Place, Potts Point. These were confirmed covertly by police who observed there was a total of five packages containing a total of four fake Medicare cards and forty-one fake credit cards.

Offence Number 8 - Dishonestly deal in personal information on 18 April 2009

57.Between 18 February 2009 and 1 July 2009 the offender dealt with a significant amount of credit card data worth in excess of $100,000. During that period the offender transferred or caused to be transferred offshore a significant sum of money being the proceeds of the use of that credit card data. The amounts so transferred was in excess of $AUS100,000. When interviewed by police on 22 December 2009, the offender admitted to gambling some of the proceeds of the credit card scheme and sending about $AUS100,000 of the proceeds of the credit card scheme to Macau.

Offence Number 10 - Supply prohibited drug

58.Between 10 March 2009 and 15 April 2009 the offender made arrangements in a series of telephone conversations with a man named ""Khaled"" to purchase drugs and send them via Australia Post from Sydney to Melbourne. The offender arranged for the package containing the drugs to be sent to Melbourne in early April 2009. It was addressed to Mr James, Post Office Box 1082, Brunswick from Mr Way 6 Beamish Street, Campsie. When intercepted from the postal system and examined by police the package was found to contain a black credit card holder containing two individual plastic sealed clip bags of a white crystalline substance. The substance when later analysed was found to comprise a total of 55.1 grams of methamphetamine and a purity between 10% and 13.8%. During subsequent telephone calls the offender and Khaled discussed the missing package and the offender said they could not do this any more because it was too risky and the potential losses too high.

I now turn to the offences contained in the s 16BA document and I read from the facts:

The first offence on 16BA Schedule, being dishonestly deal in personal financial information on 20 April 2009

59. This offence was committed by the offender on 20 April 2009 when he sent the details of three credit card numbers to Foong by SMS.

62.This offence was committed by the offender on 24 June 2009 when he sent the details of two credit numbers to Foong via SMS.""

The sentencing remarks

14His Honour found that the offences were serious, as reflected in the maximum penalties imposed by the Crimes Act 1900, the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. On the general facts and the applicant's evidence, he was satisfied that the applicant was the leader of the criminal syndicate, which included persons who manufactured and distributed false credit cards and identification documents used to purchase goods from retail outlets. 

15He found that the syndicate consisted of three tiers. The third tier involved those who organised shoppers to purchase goods with false credit cards. The second tier involved those who manufactured the cards and false identification documents. In the first tier was the applicant, the mastermind of the syndicate, who controlled those involved in the second and third tiers. His Honour found that the applicant's actions were motivated by greed and that he had obtained substantial financial reward, by receiving 5% of the proceeds of the sale of goods fraudulently obtained by the use of the false cards.

16His Honour noted that such criminal syndicates had caused substantial financial loss to retailers and financial institutions. He took the view that that the sentences imposed on the applicant had to contain significant elements of individual and general deterrence. 

17His Honour found that the offence of supplying 55.1 grams of methylamphetamine between March 2009 and 15 April 2009, was also clearly for substantial financial gain.

18His Honour accepted that the sentences imposed for offences 1 to 5 should be concurrent, as the acts involved could have been the subject of one conspiracy count. He also noted that apart from offence number 7 and offence numbers 3 and 4 in the s 16BA document, all offences in respect of which the applicant was to be sentenced were committed while he was subject to conditional liberty. The applicant had been dealt with by the District Court on 9 June 2006 in respect of 11 counts of having false instrument with intent to use and was placed on a 3 year good behaviour bond. His Honour concluded that committing further offences while on conditional liberty aggravated the applicant's criminality in respect of offences 1 to 7 and 10. The reference to offence 7 appears to have been an error, his Honour having noted earlier that this offence was not committed while subject to conditional liberty. He also noted that the applicant's criminal record was to be taken into account, when considering the question of the likelihood of the applicant re-offending.

19His Honour then dealt with subjective matters, noting the applicant's birth in Indonesia in 1956; his relocation to China at age 4; his move to Macau at age 17; and he having lived in Australia since 1997. He noted that the applicant's parents, who were in ill health, lived in Macau and that he had supported them in the past. He noted the applicant's involvement in unsuccessful business ventures in Macau and Australia and his history of gambling and poor financial management, prior to his involvement in the syndicate.

20His Honour referred to the report of the clinical psychologist Mr Borenstein, who diagnosed pathological gambling, which in his opinion correlated with the applicant's criminal behaviour. His Honour observed that this did not excuse the applicant's offending, but perhaps explained parts of his behaviour. He also noted past rehabilitation, which had not prevented the offending for which the applicant was being sentenced.

21His Honour noted the pleas entered at the earliest opportunity, accepting for the State offences, that the pleas had significant utilitarian benefit. As to the Commonwealth offences, his Honour accepted that the pleas indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. His Honour also noted the applicant's evidence of contrition, which he accepted was also evidenced by the pleas.

22His Honour found that there were reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, given the applicant's true contrition; his disclosure of his prior conviction for similar offences, of which the Crown was not aware; his significant assistance to police; and his agreement to undertake a treatment plan suggested by Mr Borenstein.

23His Honour took account of the applicant's state of health. He also took account of the arrest on 1 July 2009; the early indication of a willingness to plead guilty and that the delay in sentencing must have had an adverse psychological effect on the applicant. His Honour also had regard to evidence of assistance given to police. He concluded that the applicant should receive a combined discount for his guilty plea and assistance of 40%, with the discount for future assistance identified to be 10%.

24His Honour then considered questions of parity, noting as to offence number 1, that Kha Weng Foong had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for his participation in the conspiracy. Foong was on the second tier of the criminal enterprise. He was also sentenced in respect of seven lesser offences, directly related to the criminal enterprise. Those sentences were to be served concurrently with the sentence for the conspiracy offence.

25His Honour noted as to offence number 2, that another co-conspirator, Henley Han was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months for his participation in the conspiracy. He, too, was in the second tier of the criminal enterprise. He was also sentenced in respect of three lesser offences, directly related to the criminal enterprise. Those sentences were also to be served concurrently with the sentence for he conspiracy offence.

26His Honour also noted as to offence number 3, that another co-conspirator, Bing Xian Yeoh, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months for his participation in the conspiracy. He was in the third tier of the criminal enterprise. He was also sentenced in respect of two lesser offences directly related to the criminal enterprise. Those sentences were also to be served concurrently with the sentence for the conspiracy offence.

27His Honour also noted as to offence number 4, that two other co-conspirators had been sentenced. (This should have been a reference to offence number 3.) Mei Ch'eng Che (Mary Che), whose sentence of 2 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year for her participation in the conspiracy was reduced by 5 months 7 days for pre-sentence custody, with the result a non parole period of 6 months 23 days and a further period of imprisonment of 1 year. She was in the third tier of the criminal enterprise. His Honour noted that in her sentencing, account had been taken of the fact that she had spent 5 months and 7 days in custody prior to sentencing. His Honour noted that he had formed the view that she had entered the criminal enterprise as a consequence of the applicant's influence on her. She was also sentenced in respect of two lesser offences, directly related to the criminal enterprise. Those sentences were also to be served concurrently with the sentence for he conspiracy offence.

28The co-offender sentenced in relation to offence number 4 was Quoc Du Hua, who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, not for his participation in the conspiracy, but for six substantive offences, one of knowingly participating in a criminal group and five of deal with the proceeds of crime, knowing that it was proceeds of crime and intending to conceal that it was proceeds of crime. He was in the third tier of the criminal enterprise. His Honour noted that one sentence was partially accumulated, in order to reflect the totality of Hua's offending. 

29His Honour also noted as to offence number 5, that Haeslar DCJ had sentenced another co-conspirator, Yung Feng Yun, to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months for his participation in the conspiracy. He was in the third tier of the criminal enterprise. He was also sentenced in respect of seven lesser offences directly related to the criminal enterprise. A further 10 matters related to the criminal enterprise contained on a Form 1 were also taken into account on sentencing. Four of the sentences were partially accumulated, including the sentence imposed for the conspiracy offence. The total sentence was 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years.

30His Honour also took account of the sentence imposed on another member of the syndicate, Sock Meng Kee, who was sentenced in respect of 5 offences, of knowingly participate in a criminal group; dishonestly obtain valuable thing by deception; having a false instrument in her custody; dealing with proceeds of crime knowing that it was proceeds of crime; and deal with proceeds of crime being reckless as to whether it was proceeds of crime. Five lesser offences were taken into account on a Form 1, the overall sentence imposed being 2 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months. She was in the third tier of the syndicate. 

31His Honour also took into account that each of the applicant's offences could have been dealt with summarily and in relation to offences number 8 and 9, the relevant provisions of s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). His Honour also noted his view that no sentence other than a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate. 

32His Honour found special circumstances in respect of offence number 10, the drug offence, the applicant not having previously served a full-time custodial sentence. The sentence for that offence was partially accumulated. His Honour noted that despite this finding, the structure of the sentence did not permit him to reduce the overall sentence to be served, below the statutory ratio of 75%.

Ground 1 - the sentencing process miscarried 

33This ground was advanced in relation to the sentences imposed for the Commonwealth offences, offences 8 and 9, as well as in relation to the offences 1 - 7, which were State offences.

Offences 8 and 9 - the federal offences

34The various offences were committed as follows:


between 18 February and 1 July 2009:


- offence 9, of dealing with credit card data intending that money or property would become an instrument of crime;


- offences 1 to 5 the common law conspiracy offences; and


- offence 6, knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime:

between 10 March 2009 and 15 April 2009 - offence 10, the drug offence

18 April 2009 - offence 8, of dishonestly dealing in personal information without the consent of the owner of the credit card. 

1 July 2009 - offence 7, having in custody false instruments, was committed on. 

35The longest of the fixed term sentences, which were imposed for offences 1 and 2, commenced on 1 July 2009 and expire on 29 February 2016. The non-parole period fixed for the drug offence expires on 28 August 2016. In the result, that is the earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole. The concurrency and accumulation which his Honour fixed in sentencing the applicant for his various offences was:


Fixed term from 1 July 2009 expiring on 29 February 2016, (6 years and 8 months): 
- offences 1 and 2 


Fixed term from 1 July 2009 expiring on 30 April 2014 (4 years and 10 months): 
- offences 3, 4, 5 


Fixed term from 1 July 2010 expiring on 31 August 2012 (2 years and 2 months): 
- offence 8


Fixed term from 1 July 2010 expiring on 30 November 2012 (2 years and 5 months): 
- offence 7


Fixed term from 1 July 2010, expiring on 31 March 2014 (3 years and 9 months): 
- offence 9 
Fixed term from 1 July 2010 expiring on 30 April 2015 (4 years and 10 months:
- offence 6


Non parole period from 29 February 2015 to 28 August 2016 (1 year and 6 months) and a further term of imprisonment expiring 28 February 2019 (2 years and 6 months, total term 4 years): 
- offence 10

36The applicant complained that in sentencing for offences 8 and 9, his Honour did not comply with the requirements of s 19AB(3) of the Crimes Act (Cth). Section 19AB relevantly provides:

""19ABWhen court must fix non-parole period or make a recognizance release order

(1)Subject to subsection (3), where:

(a)a person is convicted of a federal offence, or of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and

(b)a court imposes on the person a federal life sentence, or a federal sentence that exceeds, or federal sentences that, in the aggregate, exceed 3 years; and

(c)at the time the sentence or sentences are imposed, the person is not already serving or subject to a federal sentence;

the court must either:

(d)fix a single non-parole period in respect of that sentence or those sentences; or

(e)make a recognizance release order.

(2) ....

(3) Where, but for this subsection, a court would be required by this section to fix a non-parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect of a person, the court may decline to do either if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the person, the court is satisfied that neither is appropriate.

(4) Where the court decides that neither a non-parole period nor a recognizance release order is appropriate, the court must:

(a) state its reasons for so deciding; and

(b) cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court.""

37At the time of sentencing, the applicant was not serving or subject to a federal sentence. In those circumstances, under s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act (Cth) a single non-parole period, or a recognisance release order would ordinarily be made in respect of counts 8 and 9, they being federal offences. His Honour declined to impose either, because of his conclusion that the sentences imposed for those offences, of 2 years and 2 months and 3 years and 9 months respectively, should be made entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed in respect of offence 1. 

38That was an approach which was open to his Honour, given the proper construction of s 19AB, in circumstances where he had accepted the case advanced for the applicant below, as to how the sentences should be structured. 

39On sentencing, the approach urged for the applicant was that counts 1 to 5 should have been charged as a single conspiracy to cheat and defraud and the individual counts incorporated in the one offence, as overt acts. That approach had been discussed, but rejected by the Crown, prior to sentencing. It was submitted in those circumstances, that the sentence for counts 1 to 9 should be viewed as arising from a single course of criminal conduct. To ensure parity with the other offenders, it was urged that the sentences should be made significantly concurrent, apart from the sentence imposed in respect of the drug offence. Even in relation to that offence, it was submitted for the applicant that the principle of totality required that there be a considerable degree of concurrence. His Honour accepted those submissions. In the result he did not impose a non-parole period, or a recognisance release order for counts 8 or 9. 

40The proper construction of s 19AB depends not only upon its own terms. It must be approached in the context of other relevant provisions of the Crimes Act (Cth) and their purpose. Section 19AB is to be found in Part IB - Sentencing, imprisonment and release of federal offenders.

41There provided by s 16A(1) is an obligation to impose a sentence that 'is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'. Section 16A(2) specifies various matters which a sentencing court must take into account 'as are relevant and known to the court'. Relevantly in this case they included the question of discount for the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice and his assistance. His Honour also had to have regard to questions of accumulation and concurrence of sentences, as well as considerations of totality.

42In sentencing for the two federal offences, his Honour was expressly obliged to consider the sentences imposed for the State offences, s 16B providing:

""16B Court to have regard to other periods of imprisonment required to be served

In sentencing a person convicted of a federal offence, a court must have regard to:

(a) any sentence already imposed on the person by the court or another court for any other federal offence or for any State or Territory offence, being a sentence that the person has not served; and

(b) ....""

43His Honour was also obliged to comply with the requirements of s 19(3), which provides:

""(3)Where:

(a) a person is convicted of a federal offence or offences, and a State or Territory offence or offences, at the same sitting; and

(b) the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each federal sentence commences but so that:

(c) no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

(d) if a non-parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences - the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non-parole period commences immediately after the end of the period.""

44His Honour also had to adhere to s 19AJ, which provides:

""19AJ Court may only fix non-parole periods or make recognizance release orders for federal sentences of imprisonment

This Division does not authorise a court to fix a single non-parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect both of federal sentences of imprisonment and State or Territory sentences of imprisonment.""

45It follows that in construing s 19AB, consideration must be given to the express recognition in the Crimes Act (Cth) that as here, a court may be sentencing an offender in the one sitting in respect of convictions for both State and Federal offences, or that the offender may already be serving other sentences, to which attention must be paid in the sentencing exercise. While the Crimes Act (Cth) does not permit a single non-parole period to be fixed for both State and Federal offences, it does require the sentencing judge to ensure that there are no gaps between the end of any non-parole period fixed for any other offence, and the commencement of the sentence for a Federal offence. The sentencing court must also consider the sentences imposed for other State and Federal offences, when determining the sentence to be imposed for any particular Federal offence. 

46Given all of those other requirements, it is not surprising that by s 19AB(3) a sentencing judge is also given a discretion not to impose a non-parole period or recognisance order, in respect of a Federal offence 'if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the person, the court is satisfied that neither is appropriate'. As discussed in R v Suares-Mejia [2002] WASCA 187; (2002) 131 A Crim R 577 at [17], these are the very matters generally relevant to the sentencing exercise.

47Contrary to the submissions advanced for the applicant, properly construed, the discretion granted by s 19AB(3) is a wide one, to be exercised having regard not only to the nature and circumstances of the particular Federal offence for which an offender is being sentenced, but also to the offender's antecedents. In this case one of the circumstances of counts 8 and 9 which his Honour had to consider, was that they were but two of a series of offences committed by the applicant while operating the criminal syndicate of which he was the mastermind, and for which he was then being sentenced. 

48The Crimes Act (Cth) contemplates that an offender may be being sentenced at the one time for a number of offences, in circumstances which will have an impact upon whether or not a non-parole period or recognizance release orders are appropriate to be imposed for a particular offence. It also contemplates that the offender's antecedents may be relevant to consider, for example where an offender is already serving a term of imprisonment for other State or Federal offences. It is in all such circumstances, that the discretion given by s 19AB (3) not to impose a non-parole period or recognizance release order may arise to be exercised. 

49In any of those situations, if the sentencing judge is of the view that given the nature of the Federal offence or offences for which the offender is being sentenced, or the circumstances in which that offence or offences were committed, or having regard to the offender's antecedents, it is not appropriate to impose a non-parole period or recognizance release order for the offence or offences for which the sentence is being imposed, the discretion is enlivened. 

50An obvious situation in which such a conclusion may be reached, is where, as in this case, the sentence for the Federal offence is to be made entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for another offence. That was what was urged upon his Honour for the applicant. Another obvious situation where such a conclusion would be available, is where the sentence is to be made concurrent with a sentence for another offence, which the offender is already serving. In both of those situations, imposing a non-parole period or recognisance order would be an obvious futility, making its imposition inappropriate.

51It follows that the construction for which the applicant contended, that the discretion given by s 19AB(3) is not a wide one and can only be exercised, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the particular Federal offence for which the offender is being sentenced, may not be accepted. That approach overlooks both the words of the section itself and the role it plays in the scheme of the Crimes Act (Cth). It fails to give proper effect to an important purpose of this part of the Act, namely to ensure that in sentencing an offender for a Federal offence to a term of imprisonment, the sentencing judge has regard to all relevant circumstances, including the nature and circumstances of the other offence or offences being dealt with, the offender's antecedents, including other sentences not already fully served and to ensure that there are no gaps resulting from the sentence imposed.

52As was accepted for the applicant, it is also relevant to consider that s 19AH requires a Court which has failed fix to a non-parole period, or to make, or properly to make, a recognizance release order, to do so on application to that Court. In this case there has been no such application to the District Court. If it had been concluded that there was some error in his Honour's approach, it would have been appropriate to refuse leave to appeal, so that the applicant could approach the District Court to deal with the error. That is not necessary in this case, because his Honour was clearly not in error in exercising the discretion given by s 19AB(3) as he did. 

The State offences

53As to the State offences, it was submitted that his Honour erred in declining to fix non-parole periods for all offences. It was only in relation to offence number 10, the drug offence, that a non-parole period was fixed. The reasons given for declining to fix non-parole periods in respect of the other State offences were that the structure of the sentences made it inappropriate to do so. 

54The provisions of ss 44 and 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 were relevant to this part of the sentencing exercise. They provide:

""44 Court to set non-parole period
(1) Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).
(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).
(2A) Without affecting the requirement to set a non-parole period for a sentence, a court imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of 2 or more offences on an offender may set one non-parole period for all the offences to which the sentence relates after setting the term of the sentence.
(2B) The term of the sentence that will remain to be served after the non-parole period set for the aggregate sentence of imprisonment is served must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).
(2C) The court need not indicate the non-parole period that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence unless it is required to do so by section 54B (4A).
(3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2), (2B) or (2C) does not invalidate the sentence.
(4) Schedule 1 has effect in relation to existing life sentences referred to in that Schedule.

45 Court may decline to set non-parole period
(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, for offences (other than an offence or offences set out in the Table to Division 1A of this Part), a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the offence or offences if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so:
(a) because of the nature of the offence to which the sentence, or of each of the offences to which an aggregate sentence relates, or the antecedent character of the offender, or
(b) because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, or
(c) for any other reason that the court considers sufficient.
(2) If a court declines to set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, it must make a record of its reasons for doing so.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.
(4) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.""

55It follows that his Honour's approach in fixing a non-parole period only for the State drug offence, was also available as a matter of discretion. His Honour was sentencing the applicant for both State and Federal offences. No error has been shown in the decision to exercise the discretion granted by s 45(1) not to impose a non-parole period in relation to offences 1 to 7, particularly given his Honour's acceptance of the approach to the structure of the sentence urged upon him for the applicant. 

56Leave to appeal on this ground should be refused.

Ground 3 - the sentence was commenced at an excessively high level
Ground 6 - the sentencing judge erred in failing to take delay into account
Ground 7 - the sentencing judge erred in failing to observe the principle of totality

57It was submitted for the applicant that his Honour must have commenced his sentencing exercise by fixing a notional total sentence in excess of 17 years, before he made allowance for the early plea and assistance, to result in a total overall sentence of 9 years, 7 months. An overall starting sentence of 17 years was submitted to be manifestly too high, in the circumstances of these offences. 

58It was also complained that in his remarks his Honour did not refer to the need for restraint or to the principle of totality, with the result that there was a concealed error in the sentence imposed for the drug offence. This was a severe sentence which should have been further reduced, to reflect totality, in order to avoid an unduly severe sentence. It was also complained that there was no identifiable reduction in the applicant's sentence, reflecting an allowance for delay. 

59It must firstly be noted that this submission reflected a mathematical calculation, taking the total sentence imposed as reflecting 60% of the starting sentence. It did not reflect anything which his Honour said in his sentencing remarks. Given the way in which his Honour structured the sentence, it is apparent that he did not approach the determination of the sentences he imposed in the way submitted for the applicant.

60A total sentence of 9 years, 7 months is not mathematically 60% of a starting sentence of 17 years. Not only is that a figure of which his Honour made no mention, the submission proceeds on the basis of an assumption that his Honour commenced his sentencing exercise, by fixing a total sentence for all ten offences, which he then discounted by 40%. That would have involved an obvious departure from the approach to sentencing discussed in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45], which requires that the appropriate sentence for each offence be determined, before questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality are considered. There is nothing in his Honour's sentencing remarks which suggests that this was his Honour's approach. To the contrary, the structure of the sentences which he imposed, makes it apparent that he did not depart from the required approach.

61The failure to state the starting point of the individual sentences imposed does not mean that those sentences were excessively high, as was submitted for the applicant. Light is obviously shed on the starting point of each sentence, by the sentence finally imposed by his Honour, having taken into account relevant mitigating and aggravating matters, by the 40% discount his Honour concluded the applicant should receive. 

62What his Honour did not do was to indicate what sentence he would have imposed, in the case of each offence, but for the 40% discount he determined that the applicant would receive. Identification of such a starting point is not only a useful approach for sentencing judges to adopt, because it provides obvious transparency in sentencing, but is one which is consistent with the approach required by both applicable State and Federal legislation.

63In the case of the two Federal offences, his Honour was bound by s 21E of the Crimes Act (Cth). It relevantly provides:

""21EDirector of Public Prosecutions may appeal against reductions where promised co-operation with law enforcement agencies refused

(1) Where a federal sentence, or a federal non-parole period, is reduced by the court imposing the sentence or fixing the non-parole period because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies in proceedings, including confiscation proceedings, relating to any offence, the court must:

(a) if the sentence imposed is reduced-specify that the sentence is being reduced for that reason and state the sentence that would have been imposed but for that reduction; and

(b) if the non-parole period is reduced-specify that the non-parole period is being reduced for that reason and state what the period would have been but for that reduction.

(2) Where:

(a) a federal sentence is imposed or a federal non-parole period is fixed; and

(b) the sentence or non-parole period is reduced because the offender has undertaken to co-operate with law enforcement agencies as described in subsection (1); and

(c) after sentence, the offender, without reasonable excuse, does not co-operate in accordance with the undertaking;

the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time while the offender is under sentence, if the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so, appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence or of the non-parole period.

(3) ....

(4) ....""

64In the case of the Federal offences, his Honour did not specify, as he was obliged by s 21E(1) to do, what the sentence would have been, but for the reduction. The failure to comply with s 21E, of itself, does not invalidate the sentence imposed (see R v TAE [2005] NSWCCA 29 at [20]). 

65In the case of the State offences, s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, makes similar provision, providing:

""23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities
(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.
(2) In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(3) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4) A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a) indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and
(b) state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and
(c) where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5) Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence ""

66Subsections 23(4) to (6) were inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010, which commenced operation on 14 March 2011. The amendments did not apply in this case, because while the applicant was sentenced in September 2011, he had entered his plea on 1 December 2010. By schedule 2 Part 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the amendments did not apply to an offence where before 14 March 2011 a plea had been entered and was not withdrawn, or there had been a conviction. 

67Thus while a desirable approach to sentencing, his Honour was not obliged to state the penalty he would have imposed for the State offences, but for the discount for assistance. .

68In the result there is, it must be accepted, some difficulty in understanding what sentence his Honour would have imposed in respect of the individual offences, but for the discount given. To take offence 1 as an example, if the sentence of 6 years and 8 months reflected a 40% discount, the starting figure would have been something in excess of 11 years, 1 month. That seems to have been an unlikely starting point. 

69The explanation for the final figure arrived at, may well lie in his Honour's acceptance that in fixing sentence, the delay in sentencing the applicant was a factor to be taken into account in his favour. His Honour indicated that he accepted that this was a factor he was obliged to take into account. He was not obliged to identify how that factor operated as a part of the instinctive synthesis involved in the sentencing exercise. The complaint on appeal that there was no identifiable reduction in the applicant's sentence, reflecting an allowance for delay has no foundation. His Honour would have erred, had he given such an identification.

70In the result, given the sentences which his Honour imposed, both individually and overall, the submission that there must have been an excessively high starting point, is simply not born out. To the contrary, given the serious offences for which the applicant was being sentenced, it is apparent that his Honour adopted an approach which was urged upon him for the applicant, which in the end result, achieved a considerably lenient outcome.

71This is revealed by how his Honour structured the sentences he imposed. 

72The sentences for the seven State offences and the two Federal offences concerned with the crime syndicate which the applicant headed, were all made concurrent with the sentence imposed for the first conspiracy offence. Four further Federal offences were taken into account. For all of those offences the applicant will serve a fixed term of 6 years and 8 months. This is the result of his Honour's application of the totality principle, which requires that where an offender is being sentenced for more than one offence, consideration be given to the question of whether it is just to sentence the offender consecutively for each offence. As discussed in Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 205 ALR 346 at [18], when sentencing an offender for multiple offences, as well as determining individual sentences, a sentencing court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour for which the sentences are being imposed and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all of those offences.

73In R v MAK; R v MSK (2006) [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006)167 A Crim R 159 it was observed, however, at [18]:

""18 A sentencing court must, however, take care when applying the totality principle. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at [112]. For similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender who is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no, or little, penalty is imposed for the additional offences.""

74Also to be considered by a sentencing court is that just because the criminal conduct involved in different offences may be seen as part of one criminal course of conduct, fully concurrent sentences may not be appropriate. Concurrent sentences should not be imposed, if that fails to take account of relevant differences in conduct. In R v Welden [2002] NSWCCA 475; (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 it was observed at [48]:

""48 It is not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed - but this is not an inflexible rule: Wilkins (1988) 38 A Crim R 445 (per Lee CJ at CL and Carruthers J, Allen J dissenting). The practice should not be followed where wholly concurrent sentences would fail to take account of differences in conduct, the subject of punishment on each count: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 (see also 621 to 622)."" 

75The question to be asked by a sentencing court contemplating the imposition of concurrent sentences is, can the sentence imposed for one offence encompass the criminality of all the offences for which the offender is being sentenced? 

76In this case, his Honour took the view that the sentence of 6 years, 8 months imposed for the first conspiracy offence, encompassed the criminality of all of the other offences, apart from the drug offence. Those offences carried with them maximum penalties ranging from 5 to 20 years and for the drug offence, a maximum of 15 years. As his Honour found, the applicant's offences were serious. Even the sentence imposed for the drug offence was only partly accumulated, with the final result a total sentence of 9 years and 7 months. His Honour did not explain why the sentences he imposed for offences 1 to 9 were made wholly concurrent, although he did observe that he accepted the submission put for the applicant, that 'offences 1 to 5 should be concurrent sentences as the overt acts of the offender could have been the subject of one conspiracy count'. 

77The applicant was being sentenced as the mastermind of a significant crime syndicate, responsible for supervising the criminal conduct of the other offenders involved, from which he had derived considerable rewards. He was being sentenced for nine offences which related to different aspects of the conduct of this criminal enterprise, five of them being conspiracies involving other offenders. His Honour also had to take four further Federal offences into account in the sentencing exercise. In those circumstances, it is quite apparent that his Honour's approach to the structure of the sentences and the operation of the principle of totality, involved considerable leniency. 

78The sentence imposed for the first offence, of 6 years and 8 months was accepted as appropriately punishing the applicant for all of the other offences committed in the course of his management of this crime syndicate. That reflects a starting sentence, prior to discount of something over 11 years, 1 month, as I have explained. Given the evidence upon which his Honour was sentencing the applicant, it cannot be concluded that this was an excessively high starting point. 

79As for the drug offence, his Honour imposed a total sentence of 4 years, with a non-parole period of 1 year, 6 months commencing on 29 February 2015. It expires on 28 August 2016, the earliest day on which the applicant will be eligible for release, with the further term expiring on 28 February 2019. The result of that approach is that the applicant will be eligible for parole 6 months after the expiry of the fixed term imposed for the first offence, which expires on 29 February 2016. In the circumstances of the applicant's offending, this too was a considerably lenient outcome, which does not reflect the errors of which the applicant complained

80In my view leave to appeal on these grounds must also be refused. 

Ground 2 - the sentences imposed were unusually harsh and severe
Ground 5 - the sentencing judge erred in failing to maintain parity

81The applicant's case was that the total sentence was unduly harsh and severe, as were the individual sentences imposed. It was also complained that the total head sentence imposed was far in excess of those imposed on co-offenders involved in the same criminal enterprise. The applicant's role in the hierarchy did not warrant his sentence, nor did the drug offence of which he was convicted. 

82In considering these grounds it must be born in mind that the applicant received a discount on sentence of 40% and the other offenders discounts of 25%. The fixed term which encompassed all of the applicant's crime syndicate offences was 6 years and 8 months. The total term for all offences is 9 years and 7 months. The applicant will become eligible for parole on 28 August 2016, six months after the expiration of the fixed term which expires on 29 February 2016. The sentence for the drug offence expires on 28 February 2019.

83The sentences which need to be considered, so far as considerations of parity are concerned, are those variously imposed in respect of the offences concerned with the crime syndicate. The sentences imposed for the conspiracy offences were:

The applicant - the mastermind - total fixed term - 6 years and 8 months 

Foong - second tier - 4 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months

Han - second tier - 3 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months

Yeoh, - third tier - 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months

Che - third tier - effective sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year

Sock Meng Kee - third tier - 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months

Yung Feng Yun - third tier - 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months

84The other offender Quoc Du Hua, who was in the third tier received for 6 related offences, one of knowingly participating in a criminal group and 5 of deal with the proceeds of crime, knowing that it was proceeds of crime and intending to conceal that it was proceeds of crime, a term 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years

85The result, it was complained, was that the applicant's fixed term was more than double the non-parole periods imposed on the other offenders involved in the criminal enterprise. It was also submitted to be exceptional to impose a greater penalty on an offender than that imposed for a completed substantive offence. Reference was also made to statistics for the various substantive offences, which it was submitted showed that excessive individual sentences had been imposed on the applicant.

86The disparity between the offenders, particularly those in the second tier, was submitted to be so great, as to have left the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance. The difference in sentencing could also not be explained, it was submitted, by the sentence imposed for the drug offence, which was also submitted to be unusually severe.

87In my view a basis for these grounds of appeal has not been made out. What has to be established is that on the facts, the sentence imposed is manifestly wrong, or plainly unjust, so as to allow this Court to conclude that there has been a failure to properly exercise the sentencing discretion (see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [22]).

88The evidence established that the applicant was the head of a substantial criminal enterprise. That was his evidence. He was also being sentenced for an unconnected drug offence. There was no issue below that in the circumstances, the applicant could expect to receive a custodial sentence, absent reductions for pleas and assistance. 

89Unquestionably the overall sentence for his conspiracy offences, let alone the totality of the offences committed in connection with the operation of the crime syndicate, had to be considerably lengthier than those imposed on his co-offenders, given the respective circumstances of their offending. His Honour also had to sentence the applicant for the drug offence, which he properly found was a serious one, given the amount of the drugs involved. He also had to consider that some of the applicant's offences were committed while on conditional liberty. His criminal record also had to be taken into account, as did his subjective circumstances. They were different to that of the other offenders.

90As the head of a substantial criminal enterprise, organised in three tiers, the applicant was convicted for his role in that operation, in which he not only conducted the syndicate for substantial reward, of over $100,000, but supervised those involved in the lower two tiers, in their separate roles. So far as the conspiracy charges were concerned, it was relevant that they were each involved only with him, not with each other. 

91The sentences imposed on the other offenders reflected their respective lesser roles in the applicant's substantial, sophisticated criminal enterprise. The sentence imposed on the applicant reflected his significantly greater involvement in planning, organising and co-ordinating the activities of the others, over a lengthy period of fraudulent conduct. He was also sentenced in respect of a serious drug offence which he also engaged in for considerable reward, unconnected with the syndicate. The other offenders were not involved in that offence, or the other offences in respect of which the applicant was being sentenced, or the four other offences which were being taken into account. 

92The respective sentences imposed on the co-offenders do not permit the conclusion urged for the applicant, that for his offending, he should only have received a sentence 'somewhat higher' than that of his co-offenders. His offending on the conspiracy offences alone, were of significantly greater criminality than that of the other offenders.

93Given their respective roles in the criminal enterprise and their differing subjective and objective cases, the applicant's sentence is not unusually heavy. Also to be considered is the approach his Honour adopted to questions of accumulation and concurrence, which cannot be the subject of proper complaint, having advantaged the applicant as they unquestionably did.

94The parity principle requires that where co-offenders involved in the same criminal enterprise are sentenced, the sentence imposed must have regard to the existence of their common purpose, but it must also have regard to their respective roles in the criminal enterprise, as well as the subjective facts of the individual offences and the offender's respective degree of culpability. 

95The applicant was the only one of those involved in the crime syndicate sentenced for a drug offence. Neither the sentence imposed, nor the approach adopted to the question of accumulation of that sentence, provide a basis for the complaints advanced; even when consideration is given to statistics relied on, which it was submitted showed that in 292 cases of the kind with which offence 10 was concerned, 50% received non-parole periods of 12 months or less. The limited utility of such bare statistics has been repeatedly discussed. In this case, even if their relevance were not to be questioned, they do not assist the applicant in establishing that the sentence imposed was excessively harsh. 

96In this case it has not been established that the sentences imposed on the applicant were harsh, or that those imposed on any of the applicant's co-offenders properly give rise to a justified sense of grievance on the applicant's part, nor to the appearance that justice has not been done. To the contrary, the applicant has had the benefit of considerable leniency, given his Honour's acceptance of the approach to sentencing urged upon him for the applicant below.

97In my view given the sentences imposed, particularly when compared to those imposed on the co-offenders, these grounds, while arguable, do not have merit. In the result leave to appeal should be granted in respect of these grounds, but the appeal dismissed.

Ground 4 - there was insufficient allowance for assistance

98The applicant received a combined deduction of 40% for assistance and plea, as was submitted on his behalf in the written submissions advanced below. His Honour identified 10% of that figure as representing future assistance. On appeal it was submitted for the applicant that this reflected that there had been a 'miniscule' allowance given for the considerable assistance which he had already provided. 

99It was also submitted that this Court's approach in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151, was unnecessarily restrictive. There it was held that a combined discount should generally be between 20% - 50%, with 50% reflecting assistance of a very high order and that such a discount must not result in a sentence which is manifestly inadequate. 

100 In this case, it was submitted that the Crown had not disputed that there should be a 25% discount for the plea. In the result there can only have been an allowance made of 5% for past assistance, in circumstances where it had been accepted that there had been significant assistance given by the applicant to police in the apprehension and conviction of others and a plea entered at the earliest opportunity. In the result the discount given was too low.

101In the written submissions advanced below, the case put for the applicant was that there should be a combined discount of 40% for the applicant's early plea (which warranted a discount of 25%) and for assistance. In oral submissions it was put that a discount as high as 45% was warranted, but when his Honour indicated his reservations about that level of discount, 40% was pressed. No submissions were directed to the identification of future assistance, as opposed to past assistance. 

102The power to grant a discount was governed by s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and by s 21E of the Crimes Act (Cth). In granting a discount, his Honour had to ensure that the sentence imposed after discount, was not 'unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence'. Given his Honour's approach to concurrence and accumulation, that was of particular significance in this case. 

103Here his Honour was dealing with both State and Federal offences. In assessing the discount his Honour thus had to consider various matters, including the strength of the Crown case, which was relevant to the plea entered to the Federal offences, where it was the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice which arose to be considered. That was not relevant to the State offences, where the utilitarian value of the plea arose to be considered (see Danial v R [2008] NSWCCA 15 per James J at [27] - [28]).

104The purpose of identifying a part of the discount given as referable to future assistance, is that in the event that the promised assistance is not forthcoming and the Crown brings an appeal under s5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, seeking to have the sentence varied, the relevant part of the discount may be identified. 

105While minds might differ as to the identification in this case of the amount of the discount referable to future assistance at 10%, given the assistance which the applicant had already given, the total discount of 40% and the resulting sentences imposed upon the applicant, do not reflect any error. It should not be overlooked that the applicant received not only the discount for which he pressed below, but also the benefit of the approach urged for him, as to the structuring of the sentences to be imposed. 

106The exercise of these discretions all impacted upon his Honour's obligation to ensure that the final sentences were not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending which was being dealt with in the sentencing exercise. It seems to me that any greater discount than that given, would in this case have resulted in a sentence which was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the applicant's offending, both in respect of the individual offences and having in mind the overall criminality which had arisen for consideration on sentencing.

107In those circumstances, in my view leave to appeal on this ground must also be refused.

Ground 8 - the failure to find special circumstances in relation to the whole sentence

108Special circumstances were found by his Honour in relation to offence 10, with the result that the statutory ratio provided in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , that 'the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period' was departed from. 

109The applicant was sentenced to a total term of 4 years for that offence, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 29 February 2015 and expiring on 28 August 2016 and a further term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 28 February 2019. Adherence to the statutory ratio would have resulted in a non-parole period of 3 years. Also to be considered is that because of the accumulation ordered, the applicant will be eligible for release on 28 August 2016, six months after the expiry of the fixed sentence imposed for offence 1. 

110A non-parole period is the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to that offence (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 627-629.) 

111His Honour explained that he took this approach, 'for the reason that I have partially accumulated that sentence and that the offender has not previously served a full-time custodial sentence'. He then observed:

'Despite my findings of special circumstances in respect of offence number 10, the structure of the sentences did not permit me to reduce the overall sentence to be served beneath the statutory ration of seventy-five per cent.'

112This reflected the requirements of s19AJ of the Crimes Act (Cth) and his Honour's approach to concurrence and accumulation, which resulted in the total sentence of 9 years, 7 months. 

113On appeal it was submitted, nevertheless, that another basis for a finding of special circumstances had been overlooked by his Honour, that is, accumulation or aggregation of the sentences themselves. It was submitted that his Honour should have found special circumstances in respect of the whole aggregate sentence. He should have imposed an aggregate sentence, together with a non-parole or minimum period, reflecting an adjustment to the normal ratio, reducing the entire minimum period accordingly. 

114These submissions may not be accepted. His Honour's approach involved considerable leniency, as I have explained. He accepted the case pressed for the applicant below, both as to the approach to be adopted to the sentencing of the crime syndicate offences, which were all made concurrent and the drug offence, which was only partially accumulated. He found special circumstances in respect of that offence, departing considerably from the statutory ratio. In the result, there will only be 6 months served in prison in respect of the drug offence, before the applicant is eligible for parole. It is apparent that in so exercising his discretion, his Honour did not overlook the impact of either concurrency or accumulation, in the sentences which he imposed. .

115As discussed in R v Ma [2004] NSWCCA 92; (2004) 145 A Crim R 434, a non parole period must adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the necessary punitive considerations. Consideration must also be given to questions of deterrence. As recently discussed in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7:

""28A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]. 

29'As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive': R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; R v Cramp at [36]. 

30Simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, the court is not required to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow, above, at [22]. 

31The degree or extent of any adjustment of the ""statutory ratio"" is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp, above, at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33].""

116Here, the applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 28 August 2016, after having served a total sentence of some 7 years and 2 months, only 6 months of which is referrable to the drug offence alone. He will then be supervised on parole for a period of 2 years and 6 months. Given his Honour's conclusions as to the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation, it is difficult to see that this will not provide the applicant with an appropriate period of supervision. 

117The applicant will have served a term of imprisonment which has been the result of a considerably lenient approach to the assessment of the overall minimum period for which he must be kept in detention, in relation to all of the offences for which he was being sentenced. Any further reduction in the non-parole period would result in a term of imprisonment which does not properly reflect the objective seriousness of the drug offence for which the applicant was sentenced. 

Order

118 I would order that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed.

		14 September 2012",2012-09-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760086,R v Kaewklom (No. 2) [2012] NSWSC 1117,"Judgment (on question whether it was open to Offender in law to seek leave to withdraw his plea of guilty)

1JOHNSON J: On 5 September 2012, the trial of the Accused, Kukiat ""Gang"" Kaewklom, commenced before a jury upon a charge that, on 25 February 2011 at Liverpool in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Frederick McGregor. 

2A jury having been empanelled, the trial proceeded until 10 September 2012. 

3At the commencement of proceedings on Monday, 10 September 2012, Mr Averre, counsel for the Accused, indicated a desire to confer with his client during the course of the morning (T73). I indicated that a longer than usual morning tea adjournment would be taken, to accommodate the conference which Mr Averre and his instructing solicitor, Ms Duchen, wished to have with their client. 

4After the morning tea adjournment, Mr Averre informed the Court that (T101):

""As a result of some discussions I had between nine and 9.30 this morning I thought it appropriate to have a conference with the accused. The result of those discussions, the accused would now change his plea and would plead guilty to the murder on the indictment."" 

5I pause for a moment to observe that the circumstances of this trial were somewhat unusual. The nature of the charge brought against the Accused was referred to in my decision on pretrial matters: R v Kaewklom (No. 1) [2012] NSWSC 1103. As I observed in that judgment (at [3]-[6]), the physical attack by the Accused upon Mr McGregor, in a courthouse cell adjacent to the Liverpool Local Court, was captured on closed-circuit television. The images depicted showed the Accused (an 18-year old man) grabbing hold of the deceased (a 69-year old man) and throwing him to the ground and then repeatedly stomping and jumping with his two feet on his head and upper chest area. 

6As the judgment on pretrial issues also made clear, application was made by the Accused for leave to adduce evidence of substantial mental impairment outside the time permitted by statute. The judgment in R v Kaewklom (No. 1) addressed associated pretrial rulings concerning evidence.

7The real issue in the trial concerned the partial defence of substantial mental impairment. The opening addresses of both the Crown and Mr Averre confirmed this understanding. 

8It was the case, in circumstances described in R v Kaewklom (No. 1), that Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, had provided reports concerning the Accused, the third of which, dated 10 August 2012, indicated that the partial defence of substantial mental impairment was open. 

9The Crown retained Professor David Greenberg, who prepared a report after examining the Accused on two occasions, on 25 and 31 August 2012 at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater. That report indicated that the Accused did not have available to him a partial defence of substantial mental impairment. 

10It was a clear inference that the circumstances which gave rise to the desire of defence counsel to confer with his client on 10 September 2012, were that Dr Westmore had altered his view in light of the report of Professor Greenberg. I adverted to that understanding (T103). Further, a report of Dr Westmore dated 11 September 2012, which was provided to the Court and served on the Crown in advance of the sentencing hearing scheduled for today, confirms that Dr Westmore altered his position in light of Professor Greenberg's opinion. 

11Accordingly, an appropriate understanding of the context in which the Accused came to revisit the question of his plea, was that the psychiatric evidence, which had provided some foundation for a partial defence of substantial mental impairment, had gone. What was left was the fatal event recorded on film, with no other apparent available defence or trial issue for the Accused.

12In those circumstances, it would be entirely understandable that counsel for the Accused, and his solicitor, would seek to revisit with their client, the question of the plea when the view of Dr Westmore was made known to them. 

13I return to the chronology of events on 10 September 2012. Having been informed by Mr Averre of his client's intention to change his plea, there was some discussion, in the absence of the jury, concerning the appropriate next step. Express reference was made to s.157 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as providing the statutory framework for what was to happen next (T101). 

14The jury returned to Court. At the request of counsel for the Accused, the Accused was arraigned again upon the charge of murder, to which he pleaded guilty. There was then some discussion in the presence of the jury as to the impact of this step on the trial and its legal consequences (T102-103). 

15Section 157 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides as follows:

""157 Change to guilty plea during trial

(1) If an accused person pleads 'guilty' to an offence at any time after having been given into the charge of a jury, and the court accepts the plea, the court is to discharge the jury from giving a verdict in the matter and to find the accused person guilty of the offence.

(2) The finding has effect as if it were the verdict of the jury, and the accused person is liable to punishment accordingly.""

16I proceeded to discharge the jury and to state that the Accused had pleaded guilty to the charge. I stated that, for the purposes of s.157(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, I found the Accused guilty of the offence, and that he was convicted of that offence (T103). 

17I did not state expressly that the Court accepted the plea. However, acceptance of the plea was part and parcel of the approach taken by the Court on that occasion. The nature of the charge, the nature of the Crown case, the available partial defence, were well known to the Court and, accordingly, I had no hesitation in accepting the plea of guilty in those circumstances. 

18The sentencing proceedings were adjourned until today, 17 September 2012. Mr Averre indicated that a further report of Dr Westmore was to be provided. As I have mentioned, that report was furnished to the Crown and to the Court on 12 September 2012. As expected, that report confirmed that there was no partial defence of substantial mental impairment available to the Accused, with Dr Westmore having altered his opinion in the light of the considered and detailed opinion expressed by Professor Greenberg.

19When the sentencing hearing commenced today, Mr Averre rose and indicated that he wished to make an application for leave to withdraw from the proceedings, the Accused having indicated a desire to withdraw his plea of guilty. He indicated, during the course of the application, that the application extended to Ms Duchen as well. The Crown had no real notice that such an application was to be made, and nor did the Court. 

20After some discussion concerning the basis of the application, and what it was that the Offender wished to happen, I took an adjournment for the purpose of reading the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; 121 A Crim R 472. Having considered that decision, and a number of other decisions which may have some bearing on the question, the hearing then resumed. 

21The Crown submission is that the decision in R v Hura is directly on point in the present circumstances. It was submitted that the legal consequence of application of the mechanism in s.157 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was that it is not open to the Court, as a matter of jurisdiction, to entertain an application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. 

22Mr Averre, who has continued to be of assistance to the Court, has acknowledged that s.157 represents a legal difficulty for the Offender. 

23I considered that it was appropriate to make a ruling on this issue without further delay, so that an assessment could be made as to what was to happen next in these proceedings. 

24I have adverted to the fact that the application by defence counsel for leave to withdraw is based upon the Offender's instructions concerning what happened last Monday. 

25I should observe that the last psychiatrist who, to the knowledge of the Court, has examined the Offender was Professor Greenberg on 25 and 31 August 2012 in, no doubt, extensive consultations for the purpose of a detailed report. There is nothing in the report of Professor Greenberg which suggests that there was any issue as to the fitness of the Offender to be tried or to enter a plea. Further, my observation of the Accused, during the course of the trial, did not give rise to any issue as to his fitness in my mind. Finally, and importantly, experienced counsel and solicitor for the Accused took the course which I have already mentioned, on 10 September 2012, against the background which I have also indicated.

26In my view, s.157 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, as construed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hura, places a direct jurisdictional impediment in the way of any application by the Offender for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. 

27As Spigelman CJ said in R v Hura at 474 [12], the effect of the mechanism now contained in s.157 is to give rise to a ""deemed jury verdict"". The Chief Justice observed, at 474 [13], that once the jury has returned a verdict, the trial Judge has no discretion to permit an accused person to withdraw a plea of guilty. 

28Accordingly, the short answer to any submission that the Offender should have an opportunity to seek leave to withdraw his plea of guilty is that this course is not legally available to him. 

29The position is to be distinguished from that where, in advance of trial, and before a jury is empanelled, an accused person enters a plea of guilty. It is well recognised, as a matter of legal principle, that a person who has pleaded guilty before trial by jury has commenced, may seek leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. 

30That was the situation in R v Wilkinson (No. 2) [2008] NSWSC 1432 where it was observed, at [9], that s.157 had no application to that case. An application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty proceeded, but was ultimately rejected (R v Wilkinson (No. 4) [2009] NSWSC 323; 195 A Crim R 20), where it was observed again, at 27 [40], that s.157 had no application. There was a discretionary determination to be made in that case and there was, in addition, competing psychiatric opinion. In the end, leave to withdraw the plea of guilty was refused. 

31I mention R v Wilkinson to contrast the position in the present case. Here, s.157 does apply and the law places a clear barrier in the way of application being made to the trial Judge for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty. 

32Accordingly, the appropriate course is that I record the legal position which has been reached, and then proceed with the sentencing hearing, or if there is an application to adjourn the sentencing hearing, to entertain that application. 

33I find that it is not open in law to the Offender to make application to withdraw his plea of guilty, which has given rise to a verdict of guilty entered against him by way of s.157 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

34The next step then is to consider what is to happen with the sentencing hearing.

[Note: The counsel and solicitor for the Offender were granted leave to withdraw and the sentencing proceedings were adjourned to permit new legal representatives to be retained by the Offender.]

2760087,Isaac v R [2012] NSWCCA 195,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA: I agree with Garling J and the orders he proposes.
2LATHAM J: I agree with Garling J.
3GARLING J: On 16 August 2011, the applicant, Sam Isaac, pleaded guilty in the District Court at Sydney (Syme DCJ) to three counts of aiding and abetting the importation of a marketable quantity of a border control drug, namely heroin.  Each count occurred between 16 December 2008 and 3 April 2009.
4The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 11 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months, expiring on 10 February 2018.  The maximum penalty applicable to each count is imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $550,000.  
5The sentences commenced on 11 August 2009, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested.  He has been in custody since that time.
6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence.
Facts7A Statement of Agreed Facts (which was amended in part in handwriting) was tendered to the sentencing Judge.  A brief summary of these facts is set out below.
Count 1 - Scott Meksavanh8On 12 January 2009, Scott Meksavanh was arrested at Sydney Airport, having arrived by aeroplane from Bangkok.  
9He was wearing a pair of black shoes, which had concealed underneath the inner soles, 779.1g of a powder that, upon analysis, was found to contain 537.3g of pure heroin.  The street value of this heroin was assessed as being between $537,408 and $940,000.
Count 2 - Aram Younan10On 12 January 2009, at the same time as Scott Meksavanh arrived at Sydney, Aram Younan also travelled into and through Sydney Airport having arrived by aeroplane from Bangkok.  
11Like Mr Meksavanh, he was wearing a pair of black shoes in which there was concealed powder.  Since Mr Younan was not arrested, the precise weight of the powder, and the content of pure heroin, is unknown.  However, the applicant agreed that the quantity was at least 2g, and hence was a marketable quantity.  Her Honour found that the quantity carried by Mr Younan was about the same as that carried by Mr Meksavanh.
Count 3 - Akram Hanna12On 3 April 2009, Akram Hanna was arrested at Sydney Airport having arrived by aeroplane from Bangkok.
13He was wearing a pair of white sports shoes which were found to contain, concealed under the inner soles, 961.5g of a powder which upon analysis was found to contain 642.1g of pure heroin.  The street value of this heroin was estimated between $642,080 and $1,123,640.
14The applicant aided and abetted these three importations by doing, at least, the following:
(a)met with the organisers who were of Vietnamese descent and agreed, for financial reward, to identify couriers to wear the drug-filled shoes from Thailand to Australia, thereby importing illicit goods or substances;
(b)recruited Mr Leonard Vaga, to assist him in arranging for the importation of the illicit substances;
(c)recruited each of the three couriers involved in the importations, provided them  with, or else reimbursed them for purchasing, the air tickets to and from Thailand, accommodation in Thailand, and provided cash to each of the couriers before they travelled to Thailand;
(d)prior to the departure of the couriers, the applicant, together with Mr Vaga, made all the arrangements necessary for himself and Mr Vaga to travel to Thailand and then to Vietnam, in order to have the implicated shoes filled with the illegal substances which were to be imported;
(e)in respect of the first two counts, after arriving in Thailand, the applicant travelled to Vietnam where, with Mr Vaga, he provided the empty shoes to a Vietnamese national, who returned them to him a few days later.  Upon return to him, the applicant noticed that each of the shoes, all of which were identical in weight, was much heavier than a normal shoe and much heavier than they were, when initially handed over to the Vietnamese national;
(f)the applicant, with Mr Vaga, then travelled by road from Vietnam to Thailand, each wearing a pair of the newly filled shoes;
(g)in Bangkok, he met each of the couriers and handed over the shoes to them and gave various instructions with respect to their behaviour whilst wearing the shoes and travelling to Australia, including telling the couriers not to touch the insides of the shoes with their hands because a dog at the airport might pick up on the smell;
(h)in respect of the third count, the applicant gave instructions for Mr Hanna to travel to Vietnam where he handed over the empty shoes to a Vietnamese national, who returned them after the drugs had been concealed inside the soles of the shoes.  When Mr Hanna arrived back in Bangkok, the applicant met him, took possession of the shoes, concealed them in his girlfriend's apartment for a number of days and then returned the shoes to Mr Hanna so that he could wear them whilst he returned to Sydney.  At that time, the applicant gave Mr Hanna instructions with respect to not handling the inside of the shoes in the same terms as those given to the couriers in Counts 1 and 2;
(i)the applicant admitted that he knew with respect to Count 3, that the shoes contained heroin;
(j)the applicant admitted that he was the principal organiser who was responsible for the three importations of the marketable quantities of heroin into Australia from Thailand.  In respect of the first two counts, the applicant admitted that Mr Vaga, whom he had recruited, was also a principal organiser.
15A number of subsequent events also formed part of the Statement of Agreed Facts.  These events included:
(a)on 11 August 2009, the applicant was arrested, charged and remanded in custody;
(b)on 14 April 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence in Count 3, but pleaded not guilty to the offences in Counts 1 and 2.  The matter was sent to trial in the District Court in respect of Counts 1 and 2;
(c)in the period May 2010 to 11 August 2010, the applicant was interviewed by, and spoke to, the Australian Federal Police (""AFP"") and officers of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""CDPP"");
(d)in the period between 12 August 2010 and 17 August 2010, the applicant gave evidence in the trial of Mr Aram Younan;
(e)on 29 September 2010, immediately after the applicant's trial started, the applicant pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 2 and indicated that he adhered to his plea of guilty in respect of Count 3;
(f)on 17 December 2010, the applicant participated in a conference with prosecuting lawyers, in advance giving evidence at the trial of Mr Vaga.  
(g)In the period between 8 February 2011 and 15 February 2011, the applicant gave evidence as a Crown witness in the trial of Mr Vaga.
Sentence16The sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences, commencing with Count 3:
(i)Count 3: 8 years 4 months to commencing 11 August 2009;
(ii)Count 2: 10 years 2 months to commence on 11 August 2010;
(iii)Count 1: 10 years 2 months to commence on 11 February 2011.
17The aggregate sentence was 11 years and 8 months, commencing on 11 August 2009.  The sentencing Judge fixed a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months which commenced on 11 August 2009 and is due to expire on 10 February 2018.
18In her remarks, in addition to referring to the Agreed Facts, the sentencing Judge found or noted the following matters:
(a)a discount for the facilitation of the course of justice by the entry of the guilty plea for Count 3 should be 25 per cent, but that the discount for the plea of guilty for Counts 1 and 2 should only be notional;
(b)the applicant had provided some limited assistance to AFP and Crown authorities which merited a further discount.  No discount was available with respect to Count 1 because the courier concerned, Mr Meksavanh, had pleaded guilty before the applicant's arrest and before the provision of any assistance by the applicant to the AFP.  However, in respect of Counts 2 and 3, the sentencing Judge assessed the appropriate discount for assistance at 15 per cent;
(c)the personal circumstances of the applicant, including his age and his lack of any employment did not, having regard to the circumstances of the offences, merit a finding that the applicant had particularly good prospects of rehabilitation;
(d)the applicant had not proved that he was remorseful.  He did not give evidence on sentence;
(e)it was likely that the quantity of drug imported in respect of the charge in Count 2 was similar to the quantity imported in respect of the charge in Count 1;
(f)in respect of each importation, the applicant could fairly be described as being the only conduit between the principals who arranged for the importation and the couriers who gave effect to, and made possible, the importation.  The sentencing Judge concluded that the applicant played a significant role which was pivotal to the whole drug importation operation;
(g)although the offences were each part of an overall course of conduct, it was appropriate to accumulate the sentence to a limited extent;
(h)there were no special circumstances.
19The sentencing Judge noted that s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) applied to the sentence which she was obliged to impose, and gave consideration to the matters required by that section.
Notice of Appeal20On 29 February 2012, the applicant filed a notice of his application for leave to appeal.  To that notice he attached the following grounds:
""1. Her Honour erred in the assessment of the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea with respect to Counts 1 and 2.
2. Her Honour erred in her assessment of the value of the assistance provided and the subsequent manner of the reduction of the sentence.""
Ground 1: Utilitarian value of guilty pleas to Counts 1 and 221The applicant concedes that the pleas of guilty to Counts 1 and 2 were late.  It is apparent that the pleas were entered after the date fixed for the commencement of the trial, but before a jury was empanelled.  The trial was due to occupy three to four weeks of hearing time.  The plea no doubt saved the cost, expense and disruption associated with the hearing, but coming at the time that it did, the extent to which it facilitated the course of justice was a matter which the sentencing Judge was entitled to assess at the lower end of the ordinary range.
22The applicant submits that an examination of the sentencing Judge's remarks reveal error.  In particular, the applicant submits that since her Honour described the discount for the entry of the plea as being only a ""nominal"" one, there must have been an error because the saving of a three to four week trial could not bear the description ""nominal"".  The applicant submits that, at least, a discount of 10 per cent was an appropriate one for a late plea.  
23The law recognises that when assessing the appropriate sentence to impose, the fact that an applicant has pleaded guilty is to be taken into account in fixing the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  In Commonwealth offences, s 16A(2)(g) of the Crimes Act (Cth) obliges a court to take that fact into account.  However, the weight to be accorded to it, and the significance of it as a factor, together with whether any discount ought be identified, are matters which fall to be considered on an individual case basis.
24Since the applicant was being sentenced for offences against the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), the principles stated by the High Court of Australia in Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339, were applicable.
25The plurality, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ, said at [14]:
""Reconciliation of the requirement that a person not be penalised for pleading not guilty with the rule that a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation requires that the rationale for that rule, so far as it depends on factors other than remorse and acceptance of responsibility, be expressed in terms of willingness to facilitate the course of justice and not on the basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing.""
26As Simpson J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Harrison J agreed, said in Tyler v R [2007] NSWCCA 247; (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 at [114]:
""[The sentencing Judge] was called upon to sentence Tyler in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Cameron.  This specifically excludes reference to the utilitarian value of the plea.  Since the test is the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice, one relevant consideration, at least in some cases, is the strength of the Crown case: this may cast some light upon the question of whether the plea of guilty was truly motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or, more pragmatically, for example, by recognition of the inevitable.  Nor is there any requirement in sentencing commonwealth offenders, for quantification of a discount for the plea of guilty.""
27There was a very strong Crown case against the applicant.  His plea came late in the proceedings.  It was well within the sentencing Judge's discretion to describe, in adjectival terms, the appropriate allowance for the plea of guilty in respect of Counts 1 and 2 as being ""nominal"".  
28The sentencing Judge was, in this case, confronted with the need to assess the appropriate discounts for the pleas of guilty, differently for Counts 1 and 2, on the one hand, and Count 3 on the other, because the pleas of guilty were entered at very different times in the progress of the matters through the judicial system.
29As well, although it will be necessary to discuss this in detail when dealing with the next ground of appeal, the sentencing Judge was required to assess, as a further basis for a discount, the assistance which the applicant provided to the authorities.  Any such discount was applicable to all three counts.
30Ordinarily, it is within the discretion of a sentencing Judge to refrain from individually quantifying the particular components of a discount: R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1.  However, in the particular circumstances of this case, it would have been preferable if her Honour had done so, with respect to Counts 1 and 2, as she did with Count 3, when she fixed 25 per cent as the appropriate discount for the plea.  
31Having regard to the timing of the pleas being entered on Counts 1 and 2, a conventional assessment of the appropriate discount is 10 per cent.  There is little profit in resolving what is in essence a semantic debate about the use of the word nominal, and whether an assessment of 10 per cent would or would not fall within that description.
32However, her Honour allowed an overall discount of 15 per cent for Counts 1 and 2.  This is sufficient to incorporate a 10 per cent allowance for the plea of guilty as evidencing the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice.
33On that basis, I see no error of principle in the manner in which the sentencing Judge dealt with this aspect of the discount.
34I would not uphold this Ground.
Ground 2: Error in determining value of assistance35The applicant submits that having regard to the extent of assistance provided by the applicant to the AFP, and to prosecuting authorities, insufficient allowance was made by the sentencing Judge by way of a discount to reflect that assistance.
36As well, the applicant submits that the way in which the sentencing Judge assessed the appropriate discount, namely by assessing it differentially for each count on the indictment, was contrary to authority and amounted to an error in the sentencing process sufficient to result in a miscarriage of justice.
37In the course of the oral argument on the application, the Crown accepted that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in the way in which she approached the application of such discount for assistance as was appropriate.  The Crown accepted that this error would require this Court to re-sentence the applicant.
38This concession was correctly made. The result of this error is that the appropriate discount for assistance was not applied as it should have been.  Put differently, the applicant did not receive the full benefit of the discount for assistance to which he was entitled. He received a sentence which was longer than it should have been. I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted. 
39As a miscarriage of justice has resulted, I would uphold the ground of appeal.
Re-sentencing40In undertaking the exercise of re-sentencing the applicant, it is necessary to identify with some particularity, the extent of the assistance which was actually provided by the applicant.  The source of the evidence on this came from a document prepared by two AFP officers, dated 6 April 2011, which was tendered to her Honour, headed ""Assessment of Assistance"".  One officer was an agent, and the other a Detective Superintendent.  They were familiar with the importations and the investigations of the AFP about all of those responsible for these importations.
41The AFP officers provided an evaluation of the assistance.  Commonly, the details of such assistance are confidential.  Although no specific orders were made below for confidentiality, prudence dictates that the Court should follow the usual practice.  It is necessary, however, to give a brief summary of the AFP's evaluation.  It would appear that the applicant provided information to the AFP and agreed to, and did, give evidence as a witness at two trials.  One trial involved Mr Younan and the other, Mr Vaga.  The AFP acknowledged that his evidence had been of some assistance.
42The AFP summarised the information provided to it by the applicant, relating to the importation of the drugs as being ""of low value to the AFP"".
43Although, as the AFP points out, with respect to two of the three counts in the indictment, the information provided to the AFP by the applicant was of no assistance, or no practical assistance, that does not mean that a discount should not be assessed and applied to the sentences imposed in respect of those particular counts.  As the evaluation of the assistance demonstrates, the sentencing Judge, and now this Court, was being asked to take into account and consider as a factor in mitigation of sentence, the assistance which the applicant provided in respect of the offence committed by Mr Vaga, and his subsequent trial.  There was no matching count on the indictment upon which the applicant stood for sentencing that reflected this discrete assistance.  It was necessary to assess all of the assistance given, and apply any discount to all counts equally.
44The complexity of applying an assessed discount to multiple offences was discussed by Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed, in Felton v R [2010] NSWCCA 79 at [45]:
""45 It is important to note that, when sentencing for multiple offences, the discount has to apply to the overall sentence imposed and not just the individual sentences. This of course may be difficult when there are different discounts applicable to different sentences. A rigid application of Pearce means that the sentence for each offence, including any applicable discount, is determined and then attention paid to the issue of totality. But in considering totality, the sentencer must not lose sight of the discount that has to apply to the total sentence and not just the individual sentences. Where all sentences are made concurrent, of course the problem does not arise. But where individual sentences are accumulated, either in whole or part, the discount can be eroded.""
45In this case, in order that the discount for assistance is not eroded, and because there are different sentences being imposed on the three individual counts in the indictment, the appropriate approach is to identify and apply the assessed discount for assistance to each of the sentences, after each is initially assessed.  Totality then needs to be considered.
46In assessing the appropriate discount for assistance, it is necessary to recognise the reasons which underpin the giving of the discount.  They include:
(a)it is in the public interest that criminals with information about the activities of other criminals with whom they are associated should be encouraged to give information to the police: R v Lowe (1977) 66 Cr App R 122; R v Perez-Vargas (1986) 6 NSWLR 559 at 562 per Street CJ with whom Hunt and Allen JJ agreed;
(b)it is in the public interest that criminals should be persuaded not to trust one another and discounting the sentence of a person who provides such assistance facilitates such distrust: R v James and Sharman (1913) 9 Cr App R 142; R v Golding (1980) 24 SASR 161 at 162 per Wells J;
(c)leniency through a discount for assistance to police marks, or rewards, the good inherent in the conduct of the provider of the assistance: Golding at 172-173 per Wells J;
(d)a person who has provided assistance will often, but not always, whilst a prisoner, be confined for his or her own protection in  much harsher conditions than the general prison population.  Hardship may also be occasioned to a prisoner upon their release into the community: R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 250 per Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ; R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 227 per Gleeson CJ; R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151 at [55] per Latham J.
47However, there are two cautionary matters that need to be kept in mind.  The first is that it is no longer regarded as axiomatic that a person who has provided assistance to authorities will serve the sentence under harsher and more onerous conditions when compared to an ordinary prisoner: R v Sukkar at [4]-[5] per Howie J; FS v R [2009] NSWCCA 301; (2009) 198 A Crim R 383 at [21] per Rothman J.
48The second matter which calls for caution is that the application of a discount for assistance should not result in the imposition of a sentence which is so lenient that it would be:
""... disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender"".
R v Sukkar at [54] per Latham J.
49In considering the assessment of a discount for assistance to authorities, it is also necessary to keep in mind that there may be overlap with other mitigating factors, including a plea of guilty, and an expression of remorse or contrition, as these matters are often part of a ""... complex of inter-related considerations"": R v Gallagher at 228 per Gleeson CJ.
50I turn then to assessing an appropriate discount for assistance.  In so doing, I have regard to a number of particular matters.
51First, the assessment of the AFP officers that the assistance was of ""low value"" to the AFP, together with the Crown Prosecutor's assessment, as told to the sentencing Judge, that the applicant's conduct was regarded as being of ""some assistance"" to the Crown.
52Second, on two separate occasions and over many days on each occasion, the applicant gave evidence before a jury.  He was examined in chief, and cross-examined.  As Bryson JA remarked in R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 55 at [52]:
""An offer [of assistance] which actually goes through the fire of a trial has a far stronger claim than assistance which an offender was prepared to but was not called upon to give"".
53Third, the applicant having given evidence publicly, and thereby revealing his status as an ""informer"" and the provider of assistance to authorities, does not give any evidence which suggests that his conditions of imprisonment are any more onerous than other prisoners.  On the contrary, his affidavit of 14 June 2012, suggests that since the imposition of this sentence, he has been incarcerated in the general prison population and has had the ordinary access to eduction and medical treatment.  He has regular visits from his family.  There is no basis for any finding in this case that his conditions of custody have been or are likely to be, more onerous than any other prisoner.  
54The applicant's submissions to this Court, specifically eschewed any suggestion that the starting point for the sentence imposed in the District Court was an inappropriate one.  There was no ground of appeal which claimed that the sentences actually imposed were manifestly excessive, or that, except for the discounts which were assessed and the way in which they were applied, there was any error in the sentences imposed.
55In respect of accommodating the pleas of guilty, as I have noted above, I would allow 10 per cent on Counts 1 and 2, and 25 per cent on Count 3 for the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice.
56It is then necessary to apply the discount for assistance.  In all of the circumstances to which I have referred, and having regard to the authorities such as R v Pang [1999] NSWCCA 4; (1999) 105 A Crim R 474 and SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249, where the customary ranges are discussed.  I am of the view that each sentence should be discounted by a further 15 per cent to reflect the assistance provided.  
57Having regard to the objective criminality involved, and the subjective features of the applicant, which were adequately taken into account by the sentencing Judge. I would agree with the sentencing Judge's starting point for the sentence imposed, before she allowed any discount.  I would commence any of the sentences, which this Court should impose, from a similar starting point.  As well, no complaint was made about the manner or extent of accumulation of the sentences. Subject to considering, ultimately, the question of totality, I would apply the same accumulation.  
58Following the sentencing Judge's approach of starting with the sentence on Count 3, which was the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty many months before his other pleas, I would sentence the applicant to the following sentences:
Count 3: 7 years 6 months to commence on 11 August 2009. This incorporates an overall discount of 40 per cent from the initial starting point;
Count 2: 8 years 4 months to commence on 11 August 2010. This incorporates a discount of 30 per cent from the initial starting point, whereas the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15 per cent;
Count 1: 8 years 4 months to commence on 11 February 2011. This also incorporates a discount of 30 per cent from the initial starting point, whereas the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15 per cent.
These sentences would result in an aggregate sentence of 9 years and 10 months commencing on 11 August 2009. This aggregate sentence is constituted by the sentence on Count 1, being 8 years and 4 months, to which must be added the period of accumulation of the other two sentences, which totals 1 year and 6 months.
59Having regard to the principle of totality discussed in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, I am satisfied that in the result, the aggregate sentence of 9 years and 10 months, adequately reflects the whole of the criminality involved.  The sentencing Judge did not find any particular circumstance which merited the need for a longer parole period than would ordinarily be customary.  No submissions were made which suggested that this approach was wrong.  I agree that the sentencing Judge's approach on this issue was correct.
60In my view, an appropriate non-parole period is 7 years and 5 months, commencing on 11 August 2009.  This would mean that the first day upon which the applicant will be eligible for release would be 10 January 2017.
Orders61I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)Quash each of the sentences imposed by the District Court of NSW (Syme DCJ) on 16 August 2011.
(4)In lieu thereof, Mr Isaac is sentenced as follows:
Count 3:  a sentence of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months commencing on 11 August 2009;
Count 2: a sentence of imprisonment of 8 years and 4 months commencing on 11 August 2010;
Count 1: a sentence of imprisonment of 8 years and 4 months commencing on 11 February 2011.
In respect of all counts, Mr Isaac is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 9 years and 10 months commencing on 11 August 2009 and concluding on 10 June 2019.
(5)Fix a minimum non-parole period of 7 years and 5 months commencing on 11 August 2009 and concluding on 10 January 2017, which is the first day upon which Mr Isaac will be entitled to be released.

2760094,R. v. Michael Anthony Ryan (No. 7) [2012] NSWSC 1160,"Judgment

1MFI 21 is a DVD containing excerpts from Mr. Moody's electronically recorded interview with the police on 1st May 2011. In an earlier ruling, I gave the Crown leave to cross-examine Mr. Moody under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on the basis, inter alia, that Mr. Moody made a prior inconsistent statement: R. v. Michael Anthony Ryan (No. 2) [2012] NSWSC 1034.

2MFI 21 is that statement.

3The learned Crown Prosecutor now tenders MFI 21, and Mr. Waterstreet of Counsel, for the defence, objects. His objections are twofold. First, Mr. Waterstreet argues that since amendments to the Evidence Act made by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW) - which commenced on the 1st of January 2009 and implemented the recommendations contained in ALRC 102 - a prior inconsistent statement is only admissible if it falls within an exception to the credibility rule established by s.102 Evidence Act, and in this case none apply. Secondly, Mr. Waterstreet argues in the alternative that R. v. NZ (2005) 63 NSWLR 628 and Gately v. The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 208 created a particular rule about audio-visual evidence which catches MFI 21. 

The Evidence

4It is necessary to recapitulate some evidence set out in my previous ruling.

5Mr. Moody gave evidence about the incident in the carpark from 409.20T - 411.5T. At 410T.20 - 411.5T the following evidence was given in the presence of the jury:

Q. What did you see happen between the man coming from Fitzgerald Street and Michael Ryan?
A. They started to fight.

Q. When you say they started to fight who hit who?

WATERSTREET: Assuming that your Honour. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I will do it another way your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. What did you see happen?
A. He came towards Michael and Michael had come towards him and they put their fists up like they were going to fight.

Q. Did you see either man throw a punch?
A. I think Michael threw a jab or 

Q. Did you see the other man throw a punch?
A. No.

Q. You think you saw Michael throw a jab?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you see the jab connect with the other man?
A. I can't remember but 

HIS HONOUR

Q. Don't guess. 
A. I am unsure

6In the transcript of MFI 21 the following appears:

Q.386OK. What happens?

A.Michael hit him once and he started walkin', the other guy started walkin' backwards.

...

Q.388What do you see Michael Ryan actually do?

A.Hit him with his .... I don't even know if it was his left or right.

Q.389OK. Was it a punch or was it a ...

A.Yeah, he punched him.

Q.394All right. Does it connect with the fellow.

A.Yeah.

Q.395OK. Where does it hit him?

A.In the face.

Q.396All right. What do you, what do you see then?

A.The other guy started walkin' backwards and it sort of moved up .... jumpin' around

...

Q.411OK. So they come together again. Do they? 

A.Yeah.

Q.412What are they doing, or what do you see?

A.They sort of come back together, and Michael's hit him again.

...

Q.417Where did he hit him?

A. In the face.

...

Q.427OK. 

A.And then the guy just fell backwards

...

Q.429OK. Did you see that take place?

A.Yeah I seen him fall.

Q.433OK.

A.He wasn't knocked out when he fell.

Q.434OK

A.But he's fallen, and hit his head either on the gutter or the road.

7After I pronounced my rulings at the conclusion of a voir dire, the trial resumed with the jury and MFI 21 was played in their presence with Mr. Moody in the witness box (see 679T.5). No transcript of the portions played to Mr. Moody was made in the proceedings.

8At 681T, the following evidence was given:

Q. Mr Moody, you've just seen a portion of police interview played to you in this courtroom; is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And in that interview you give an account to the police of what you say happened in the carpark, amongst other things? 
A. Yes. 

Q. On that video, the one you've just seen played in relation to the carpark, you told police you saw Mr Ryan punch the other man? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Right. And the man moved backwards after that; you told the police that too, didn't you?
A. Yes. 

Q. And you told the police then Mr Ryan moved backwards and punch him again? 
A. Yes.

....

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Mr Moody, you told police you saw more than one punch, didn't you?
A. Yes. 

Q. That was true, wasn't it? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And after the last punch that you saw, I want to suggest to you you saw the other man fall backwards? 
A. I'm not sure if it was straight after, like. 

Q. I want to suggest it was straight after; putting that to you as a positive proposition, what do you say? 
A. I'm not sure. 

Q. What do you say to that, Mr Moody? 
A. I'm not sure.

...

Q. You had no problems with your memory during that interview, did you? 
A. No. Not that I I don't remember doing the interview. 

Q. You don't remember doing the interview? 
A. Well, I can't remember what I said or what I did in it. It was nearly over year and a half ago. 


9When cross-examined by Mr. Waterstreet, the following evidence was elicited at 704T.45.

Q. Did you tell police during that very same record of interview, the one that we saw played, that you could not remember things from that night? 
A. Yes. 

The course of the cross-examination was thorough and detailed. The flavour of it may garnered from the following extracts at 752T.30:

Q. So that is it. Mr Moody I want to suggest to you that having seen that and having been taken through the version you told police in the ERISP would you agree with me that your recollection during the ERISP about some activities in the mall is completely in error?

A. Yes.
...

Q. I think the statement you were referring to there is the recorded interview typed out?
A. Yes.

Q. Parts of which you were shown in the witness box with this jury?
A. Yes.

Q. And you heard and saw those parts?
A. Yes.

Q. Now was it the transcript that of that you had in mind when you told on your oath that the more you read the more confused you were?
A. Yes.

Q. And the version that you gave to police in the downstairs after you had left the cells and been taken into the interview room is again, is it fair to say, that you regard it as a somewhat unreliable account of what may have taken place?
A. Yes.

....

Q. Do you have any recollection of whether there was anything further before the man fell?
A. I can't remember, I just remember seeing him fall.

Q. But you don't know what caused him to fall?
A. No.
....

Q. And that was the last punch that you saw? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You say the fellow fell back towards, to the police. Are you saying he didn't fall as a result of the jab, did he? 
A. No. 

Q. Could he, from your recollection, were you saying to your recollection, did you see what caused him to fall? 
A. No.
...

Q. You certainly know it wasn't as a result of the jab? 
A. Yes. 

Factual Ruling

10In my judgment, considering this material as a whole, there is an inconsistency between the statement in MFI 21 that after the accused punched the deceased for the second time the deceased just fell backwards, and the evidence given before the jury that I have recounted. This inconsistency is not lessened by the statement in MFI 21 that Mr. Moody didn't know if the deceased fell because he was hit. The inconsistency is between the account in MFI 21 of a close temporal connection between the second punch and the deceased falling, on the one hand, and the disavowal of any connection between those two events in cross-examination, on the other. The final resolution of that question is, of course, a matter for the jury.

Legal Background - The Position Before The Commencement Of The Evidence Amendment Act 2007 

11At common law, a prior inconsistent statement is not evidence of the truth of its contents, only evidence that the witness may not be telling the truth: Adam v. The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96 at 104 [19]; Blewitt v. The Queen (1988) 62 ALJR 503 at 505. In Aslett v. R. [2006] NSWCCA 49 Barr J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) pointed out at [76]:

Before the commencement of the present Evidence Act, such statements, when admissible, were relevant only to the credit [of] the witness who made them. If their making was admitted, therefore, there was no purpose in tendering them: Alchin v. Commissioner for Railways (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 498.

12The High Court of Australia in Adam, (see also Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Adam aka Odishou (1999) 47 NSWLR 267) decided that under the Evidence Act, evidence of a witness's prior inconsistent statements will be admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said in them if the evidence is relevant for another purpose (that is, for a purpose other than proof of the truth of what was said in them). A footnote refers to s.60 of the Evidence Act which provided at that time:

The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.

13Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ in their joint judgment reasoned as follows:

(a)The basic test of admissibility is relevance (s.56 Evidence Act);

(b)Relevance is to be determined on the assumption that the tribunal of fact accepts the evidence: s.55(1); 

(c)Evidence of prior inconsistent statements relate to the credit of the witness;

(d)The credibility rule established by s.102 in its then form operated to exclude evidence that was relevant only to the witness' credibility;

(e)The content of the inconsistent statement could rationally affect the question of a witness' credibility as well as the assessment of the probability of several facts in issue, accordingly, the credibility rule was not engaged;

(f)Although prima facie excluded by the hearsay rule established in s.59, s.60 created an exception if the evidence was admitted because it was relevant for a purpose other than proof of the asserted fact, ie the credit of the witness;

14At 109[37] their Honours concluded:

It is true, of course, that the result differs from what would be the result at common law, the difference being that, by s 60 of the Act, the prior statements would be admitted as evidence of the truth of their contents. But that difference brought about by s 60 was one of the significant alterations in the rules of evidence that the Act was intended to effect. No longer were tribunals of fact to be asked to treat evidence of prior inconsistent statements as evidence that showed no more than that the witness may not be reliable. The prior inconsistent statements were to be taken as evidence of their truth. Thus far from the result being, as the appellant asserted, bizarre or unintended, it is the intended operation of the Act

The same result ensued in Aslett v. R.

15Gaudron J dissented in the result in Adam. Her Honour would have held that the s.38 discretion had not been validly engaged. But her Honour did not dissent about the effect of s.60 Evidence Act. At 114[57] her Honour said:

One purpose which underlies s 60 of the Act is to overcome the common law position, which the Law Reform Commission regarded as anomalous, whereby a prior inconsistent statement was admissible only as to credit and not in proof of the facts thereby asserted. It is clear that, with the enactment of s 60, that is no longer the position [footnotes omitted].


And at 115[60] her Honour said:

The omission from the dictionary definition of ""probative value"" of the assumption that the evidence will be accepted is, in my opinion, of no significance. As a practical matter, evidence can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue only if it is accepted. Accordingly, the assumption that it will be accepted must be read into the dictionary definition. And on that assumption, for the reasons given in the joint judgment, the prior inconsistent statements of Thaier Sako had substantial probative value. That being so, the combined effect of ss 103(1) and 60 of the Act was to make those prior inconsistent statements technically admissible in proof of the matters therein asserted.


Legal Considerations Following the Evidence Amendment Act 2007

16The 2007 Amending Act introduced significant amendments to Part 3.7 Credibiltiy which alter the way the hearsay rule (s.59), the credibility rule (s.102), the provisions about unfavourable witnesses (s.38) and the exception to the hearsay rule created by s.60 are to be understood as operating (cf Adam at 105 [23]). The interplay between these provisions was the key to understanding the reasoning of the plurality (and majority) in Adam.

17Odgers argues in Uniform Evidence Law Tenth Edition (2012) that these amendments have effectively reversed Adam, page 545 [1.3.7618] and 537 [1.3.7607].

18The relevant provisions are as follows:

Part 3.7 Credibility
Division 1 Credibility evidence
101A Credibility evidence
Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that: 
(a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or
(b) is relevant: 
(i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and
(ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.
Notes. 
1 Sections 60 and 77 will not affect the application of paragraph (b), because they cannot apply to evidence that is yet to be admitted.
2 Section 101A was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96.
Division 2 Credibility of witnesses
102 The credibility rule
Credibility evidence about a witness is not admissible. 
Notes. 
1 Specific exceptions to the credibility rule are as follows: 
· evidence adduced in cross-examination (sections 103 and 104)
· evidence in rebuttal of denials (section 106)
· evidence to re-establish credibility (section 108)
· evidence of persons with specialised knowledge (section 108C)
· character of accused persons (section 110)
Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.
2 Sections 108A and 108B deal with the admission of credibility evidence about a person who has made a previous representation but is not a witness.
103 Exception: cross-examination as to credibility
(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.
(2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to: 
(a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
(b) the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.
106 Exception: rebutting denials by other evidence
(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence that is relevant to a witness's credibility and that is adduced otherwise than from the witness if: 
(a) in cross-examination of the witness: 
(i) the substance of the evidence was put to the witness, and
(ii) the witness denied, or did not admit or agree to, the substance of the evidence, and
(b) the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.
(2) Leave under subsection (1) (b) is not required if the evidence tends to prove that the witness: 
(a) is biased or has a motive for being untruthful, or
(b) has been convicted of an offence, including an offence against the law of a foreign country, or
(c) has made a prior inconsistent statement, or
(d) is, or was, unable to be aware of matters to which his or her evidence relates, or
(e) has knowingly or recklessly made a false representation while under an obligation, imposed by or under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, to tell the truth.

19At a glance one can see that these provisions are markedly different from the provisions considered by the High Court of Australia in Adam. Section 101A is entirely new. It defines credibility evidence in an extended manner which covers evidence which is relevant for more than one purpose i.e. credibility and some other purpose for which it is not admissible. The first footnote refers expressly, inter alia to s.60, and interestingly seeks to impose upon s.60 an interpretation different from the interpretation which underpins Adam. See also Lee v. the Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594 at 603 [39] - [40]).

20Footnote 2 says the enactment of 101A was a response to Adam. There is a new s.102. It eschews the problematic word only which was influential in the reasoning in Adam. It picks up the expression credibility evidence as defined in s.101A and has the effect that prima facie evidence having the type of dual purpose enjoyed by the prior inconsistent statement in Adam is excluded. Section 103 is amended; the expression has substantial probative value is dropped and instead could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness is inserted. The focus is credibility. 

21Section 106 is new in form, and limits the calling of rebuttal evidence that is relevant to a witness' credibility (the word only is not used) to evidence which satisfies the two conditions expressed in pars. (a) and (b) of subsection (1), or in the alternative to par. (b), one of the conditions in subsection (2). The par. (a) condition has two parts. First, the substance of the rebuttal evidence must have been put to the witness in cross-examination, and the witness denied, did not admit or agree to, the substance of the evidence.

22I interpolate in this limited regard the exception to the credibility rule created by s.106 in its new form is reminiscent of the common law in as much as the rebuttal evidence is not admissible if in cross-examination the witness admitted the substance of the (rebuttal) evidence.

23The second condition, the par. (b) condition, is a grant of leave. As an alternative, leave is not required in five familiar categories of evidence, including in par. (c) of subsection (2) if the evidence tends to prove that the witness has made a prior inconsistent statement. 

24As Mr. Odgers S.C. points out at page 537 (1.3.7607), the Australian Law Reform Commission explained in ALRC 102 [12.14]:

Evidence relevant to both credibility and a fact in issue, but not admissible for the latter purpose, should be subject to the same rules as other credibility evidence. 


25Even so, it seems odd that the operation of s.60 provided by the High Court's interpretation in Adam should be anticipated by a footnote to a provision in Part 3.7, especially as the footnotes do not form part of the Act: s.35 Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). On the other hand, the expansive definition of credibility evidence and the new s.102 mean that gateway to the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement is through Part 3.7, rather than directly through s.56, s.45 notwithstanding: s.45(4).

26However, if admitted through the s.106 exception, the prior inconsistent statement will, by dint of s.60, be admissible as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in it in accordance with the decision in Adam, subject to the application of s.136 Evidence Act.

27I have already held by reference to the evidence I have set out that the first condition to admissibility in s.106(1) is satisfied. MFI 21 is a category of evidence which does not require leave i.e. a prior inconsistent statement. Subject to Mr. Waterstreet's second objection, MFI 21 is in my judgment admissible.

28To some extent my reasoning may conflict with the decision of McCallum J in McMahon v. John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No. 5) [2012] NSWSC 218 at [21] - [39]. However, her Honour's decision focused on the exception to the credibility rule created by s103 Evidence Act as amended. Although in that case counsel argued that the tender of a document in rebuttal was not covered by the expression evidence adduced in cross examination of a witness in s.103, the s.106 point that has been influential in my thinking was not argued. The memorandum in that case was not put as a prior inconsistent statement but only as evidence which tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth within the meaning the meaning of s103(2)(a). I acknowledge that this exception has its equivalent in s106(2)(e).

Gately v. The Queen (207) 232 CLR 208

29The Evidence Act 1997 (Qld) permitted the evidence of a child sexual assault victim to be pre-recorded and played at the offender's trial. The question arose whether such evidence should be marked as an exhibit available to the jury in the jury room with the other exhibits after they had retired to consider their verdict.

30The leading judgment, if I may put it that way, was given by Hayne J. His Honour said:

[86] The unstated premise for the proposition that a jury may have unsupervised access to recordings of evidence made under subdiv 3 of Div 4A of the Evidence Act is that the record of that evidence is a piece of real evidence, properly received in evidence as an exhibit. That premise is not right. The record of evidence given under these provisions is no more a piece of real evidence receivable at trial than is the written or electronic record of oral evidence given at the trial in the ordinary way.

...

[93] When the effect of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act is thus understood, it becomes evident that seldom, if ever, will it be appropriate to admit the record of that evidence as an exhibit. (That is not to say that there may not be evident good sense in marking the record for identification; but that is a step that is distinctly different from receiving the record in evidence and marking it as an exhibit.)

[94] Moreover, when the effect of the relevant provisions is understood in the manner described, it also follows that a request by a jury for access to evidence pre-recorded in accordance with those provisions should ordinarily be dealt with in the same way as any request by a jury to be reminded of evidence that has been led at the trial. Seldom would it be appropriate to meet a request of that kind by giving the jury unrestrained access to the recording to play and replay. The reasons for not allowing access of that kind lie in the need to preserve fairness and balance in the conduct of the trial.


31The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal came to the same conclusion about video tape evidence played at a trial under Evidence (Children) Act 1997 (NSW) in R. v. NZ. Howie and Johnson J in a comprehensive judgment reviewed cognate or comparable legislation across many common law jurisdictions before expressing their conclusions at 677 [210] in the following terms:

We should by now have made clear our view that this Court should not lay down any rule of practice or procedure to be followed in every case where the evidence in chief of a witness has been given by the playing of a videotape. However, we can summarise our views as to the procedure to be followedgenerally: 
(a) The video tape evidence of a Crown witness should not become an exhibit and, therefore, should not be sent with the exhibits to the jury on retirement;
(b) Any transcript given to the jury under s 15A should be recovered from the jury after evidence of the witness has been completed;
(c) It is for the discretion of the trial judge how a jury request to bereminded of the evidence in chief of the witness should beaddressed;
(d) It would be inappropriate for the judge to question the jury as to the purpose for which they wish to have the tape replayed;
(e) If the tape is to be replayed or the transcript of the tape provided to the jury, the judge should caution the jury about their approach to that evidence when the tape is being replayed to them or the transcript of the tape returned to them in terms to the effect that""because they are hearing the evidence in chief of the complainant repeated a second time and well after all the other evidence, they should guard against the risk of giving it disproportionate weight simply for that reason and should bear well in mind the other evidence in the case"";
(f) The judge should consider whether the jury should be reminded of any other evidence, for example the cross-examination of the witness at the time that the tape is replayed or sent to the jury room, if that step is considered to be appropriate.

But other than expressing those views, we believe that the request by a jury for the replaying of the tape should be dealt with by the judge in the exercise of discretion bearing in mind the need for fairness and balance in addressing that request.


32It seems to me that Gately and NZ highlight a principle which applies to evidence falling into a particular category. A recording of evidence made under legislation of the type considered in those cases is not a piece of real evidence, properly received in evidence as an exhibit. Rather, it is part of the record of the Court. As such a recording should not be made an exhibit, it should not go to the juryroom during the deliberations of the jury. The recording is the medium by which the evidence, or evidence in chief, of the particular witness is given. It is wrong in principle to permit the jury to have unsupervised access to that medium long after the evidence was given, because of the great risk that disproportionate weight might be given to evidence in that form (which can be played and replayed in the confines of the juryroom) over the evidence of other witnesses given in the conventional way.

33By way of contradistinction, Kirby J (at footnote 32 at 221 [31] in Gately), and Howie and Johnson JJ in NZ, referred with apparent approval to the joint judgment of Charles and Nettle JJA in R. v. Davies (2005) 11 VR 314 at 321[26]. The reference in NZ to Davies is at 663 [150], and their Honours' approval is apparent at 674[194]. 

34At 670 [177] - 671[181] Howie and Johnson JJ dealt with other categories of evidence by saying:

There are many occasions when evidence is placed before a jury by the use of electrical recording of images and the human voice. The most obvious cases are where there has been a recorded interview of a suspected person by the police and the lawful recording of conversations by the use of a listening device or a telephone interception. But there are also videotaped re-enactments of the offence, videotaped identification parades and views of the scene of a crime often with the use of computer enhancements. These are common features of modern criminal trials.

At [180] their Honours said:

... We believe it to be the almost invariable practice for the jury to receive the video/audiotape admitted as an exhibit in the juryroom when they retire to consider their verdict. It is commonplace in our experience for the jury room to be installed with the means by which the jury are able to replay the tape or disc admitted into evidence during the course of their deliberations. The jury, therefore, has ready access to, for example, the recorded interview between the accused and police or the recordings ofintercepted conversations. It also has during its deliberations the transcripts of those recordings.

Nothing in their Honours' judgment expresses any disapprobation of that practice. 

35In R. v. Davies Charles and Nettle JA said at [26]:

The danger inherent in allowing a jury to have unsupervised access to a VATE tape is that the jury will give undue weight to the complainant's evidence-in-chief and correspondingly insufficient attention and weight to the complainant's in-court-examination in chief and evidence in cross-examination. The damage exists because the VATE tape is a video tape of the complainant giving testimony in chief. But the tape of a complainant participating in an identification parade or a video identification parade is in our opinion of a different nature. It is not in the form of testimony in chief. It is the record of an event, and it is in that respect similar to other forms of video tape evidence tendered into evidence and considered by the jury during the course of their deliberations. No one suggests that a jury should not have unsupervised access to a security video tape of an offence being committed or to a video tape of a crime scene or of an accused being interviewed. And it is difficult to see that there is any more danger of a jury giving undue weight to video evidence of an identification parade than to any other video evidence of that kind. (Emphasis added)

36By way of digression, doubtless no one would cavil at the idea that some appropriate direction should be given to the jury to caution them against giving disproportionate weight to such evidence, and to consider it in the light of the evidence the eyewitnesses gave about the matters depicted on the CCTV footage, for the simple reason that some of the relevant events depicted occurred at the margin of the recording, and other events occur off screen. Especially in the case of these latter matters, the jury must rely upon eyewitness accounts in context to what is seen on the screen. 

37On the basis of Davies at [26] my ruling is that MFI 21 be admitted as Exhibit P.

		27 September 2012",2012-09-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760095,R v Kaewklom (No. 1) [2012] NSWSC 1103,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Accused, Kukiat ""Gang"" Kaewklom, is charged with the murder of Frederick McGregor at Liverpool on 25 February 2011. 

2This judgment relates to a number of applications and objections made in advance of the trial of the Accused. The pretrial hearing took place on 3 and 4 September 2012 and I announced my rulings on 5 September 2012 (T14). This judgment contains my reasons for those rulings.

The Charge of Murder

3The Crown alleges that, at about 10.35 am on 15 February 2011, the Accused (then aged 18 years) was alone in a cell in the precincts of the Liverpool Local Court with the deceased (then aged 69 years). The Crown alleges that the Accused grabbed the deceased and threw him to the ground, and then kicked him in the back before repeatedly stomping and jumping with two feet on his head and upper-chest area. It is alleged that the Accused stepped back and forcefully kicked the deceased. 

4The deceased did not touch the Accused at any time before or during the incident. 

5There is effectively no dispute that the Accused acted in this way, as the incident was captured on closed-circuit television. 

6Mr McGregor was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital suffering from multiple and severe injuries to his head and body. Surgery was undertaken, however, on 25 February 2011, his life-support system was turned off and the deceased died.

The Late Emergence of Substantial Mental Impairment as a Trial Issue

7On 25 January 2012, the Accused was committed from the Campbelltown Local Court for trial in the Supreme Court on the charge of murder.

8On 2 March 2012, the Accused was arraigned before Latham J and pleaded not guilty to the charge. His trial was fixed to commence on 3 September 2012, with a two-week estimate. 

9If the Accused intended to adduce evidence of substantial mental impairment at the trial, he could not do so, without the leave of the Court, unless notice was given to the Crown at least 35 days before the commencement date of the trial, namely 27 July 2012: s.151(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986; Clause 20 Criminal Procedure Regulation 2010. 

10Clause 10 of Practice Note SC CL2 ""Criminal Proceedings"" (issued on 13 August 2010) provides for the operation of pretrial case management procedures in this Court. In the absence of specific orders under s.136 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 or waiver of the relevant requirements, the Crown is to give the Accused notice of the prosecution case no later than six weeks before the trial date, and the defence is to respond no later than four weeks before the trial date. It appears that Clause 10 of the Practice Note applied to this case, as no other order was made when the trial date was fixed.

11Clause 10 of the Practice Note refers expressly to the need for defence notice of alibi to be given within the period prescribed by s.150 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. However, there is no reference in Clause 10 to s.151 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 concerning substantial mental impairment.

12Section 138 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 requires the accused person to give the Crown notice of the defence response which includes:

""(c) a statement as to whether or not the accused person intends to give any notice under section 150 (Notice of alibi),

(d) a statement as to whether or not the accused person intends to give any notice under section 151 (Notice of intention to adduce evidence of substantial mental impairment).""

13It will be observed that s.138(d) is expressed in terms of notice ""whether or not the accused person intends to give any notice under section 151"". It may be taken that the purpose of s.138(d) is to require an accused person to state whether or not there will be a substantial mental impairment issue raised at the trial. The statutory expectation is that this advance notice will be given before the time when s.151 notice is actually required. I will return to this topic. 

14Following a request by the Crown made on 9 August 2012, the matter was listed before me on 15 August 2012 for the purpose of confirmation of the trial date. On that day, the Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that the Crown had just been served by the Accused with three reports of Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, whereby the Accused sought to raise the issue of substantial mental impairment. 

15Dr Westmore had furnished reports, dated 15 August 2011 and 3 January 2012, to the solicitor for the Accused, neither of which stated that the partial defence of substantial mental impairment was available to the Accused. 

16However, in a third report dated 10 August 2012, Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that this partial defence was available to the Accused, for reasons explained in that report. 

17The Crown indicated on 15 August 2012 that urgent steps had been taken to retain Professor David Greenberg, forensic psychiatrist, in the hope that the matter could be ready to proceed on the scheduled trial date. 

18As the Accused had not filed and served a notice under s.151 of the Act at that time, I directed that a notice be filed and served, in support of an application for leave of the Court, as required under the statute. 

19The proceedings came before the Court again on 20 and 29 August 2012, with progress reports being provided by the Crown concerning the efforts of Professor Greenberg to furnish a report for the purpose of the trial. It was apparent that, on any view of the matter, the trial would not be in a position to commence with a jury on 3 September 2012 and I directed that the jury panel be informed that attendance was not required before 5 September 2012. 

20On 3 September 2012, the Court was informed of a range of applications and objections which were sought to be argued and ruled upon in advance of the empanelling of a jury. As will be seen, most of these issues concerned admissibility of evidence at the trial, associated with the emergence of substantial mental impairment as a trial issue. 

21Following his late retainer, Professor Greenberg had undertaken substantial work in preparation for the trial, including psychiatric assessments of the Accused on 25 and 31 August 2012 at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater (""MRRC""). However, for understandable reasons, he was not in a position to provide his report to the Crown until the early hours of 4 September 2012. The report was served on the Accused and furnished to the Court on 4 September 2012.

22In an affidavit sworn 31 August 2012, read in support of the s.151 leave application, the Accused's solicitor, Brenda Duchen, explained her involvement in the matter since its early stages, and the provision of Dr Westmore's earlier reports. Having attended to the extension of the grant of legal aid to instruct Dr Westmore once again and after receipt of certain Justice Health records on subpoena, Ms Duchen instructed Dr Westmore on 11 July 2012 to provide a further report. It was expected that this could be done quickly. It was Ms Duchen's intention to obtain a final report from Dr Westmore by the end of July 2012.

23However, the Accused was transferred to Parklea Correctional Centre, and Dr Westmore could not attend that prison. Ms Duchen requested that the Accused be transferred back to the MRRC, and Dr Westmore examined him there on 9 August 2012. Ms Duchen provided Dr Westmore's report of 10 August 2012 to the Crown promptly upon receipt, together with his earlier reports.

24Accordingly, it is clear that the Accused was not in a position to give notice prior to 10 August 2012 of intention to rely upon substantial mental impairment, as there was no evidence until then to support that partial defence. 

25Ultimately, the Crown did not oppose leave being granted to the Accused to rely upon substantial mental impairment. 

26On 4 September 2012, following the receipt of Professor Greenberg's report, I granted leave for the Accused to rely upon the partial defence of substantial mental impairment (PT25). 

27I should explain why I took that course, before raising an issue for consideration of possible procedural reform.

28It is necessary to keep in mind that the partial defence of substantial mental impairment fixes upon the state of mind of the Accused at the time of the alleged murder. It may be readily distinguished from fitness to be tried, which calls for an assessment of the Accused's mental state at the time of the proposed trial. The latter concept may ebb and flow, a circumstance recognised in s.8 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990: R v Dunn [2012] NSWSC 946. 

29With respect to the grant of leave to rely upon an alibi, where the notice requirement in s.150(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 has not been complied with, it has been said that a Court should be slow to refuse a leave application, unless prejudice arises such as is incapable of being addressed without significant disruption to the trial: Skondin v R [2005] NSWCCA 417 at [47]. 

30In my view, a similarly flexible approach ought be taken by the Court, where leave is sought under s.151 to rely upon the partial defence of substantial mental impairment after the time prescribed by statute.

31Both s.150 (alibi) and s.151 (substantial mental impairment) require notice to be given to the Crown to allow the Crown to investigate, before the trial, the issue proposed to be raised. Notice of alibi must be given at least 42 days before trial: s.150(8). As mentioned, 35 days' notice is required for substantial mental impairment.

32These notice provisions permit the Crown to undertake different types of investigations. 

33Examination of an alibi notice will give rise to police enquiries before trial. 

34Where substantial mental impairment is to be raised (invariably through the report of a psychiatrist), the Crown will seek to retain a forensic psychiatrist for the purpose of examining an accused person (sometimes, as here, more than once), conducting a document review and then furnishing a considered report on the question. At times, this process may lead to agreement by the Crown as to the existence of substantial mental impairment, and acceptance of a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. However, a proper and reasonable opportunity should exist for this to be done. It might be thought that the statutory period of 35 days is a relatively short and demanding period for the Crown to obtain expert opinion evidence of this type.

35There is a further aspect of ss.150 and 151 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which should be noted. Each provision allows the Crown, subject to any direction by the Court, to adduce evidence in reply which seeks to disprove an alibi (s.150(5)) or to disprove a contention of substantial mental impairment (s.151(3)). Factors relevant to the giving of a direction under s.151(3) were considered by Howie J in R v Fraser [2003] NSWSC 965.

36Subject to the direction of the Court, it is open to the Crown to seek to split its case to rebut a partial defence of substantial mental impairment, as a statutory exception to the common law rule: R v Fraser at [25].

37A number of observations ought be made arising from the experience in this case.

38Firstly, it might be thought that the modern case management provisions now contained in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, including s.138(d), entitle the Court to learn at an early time, and before the 35-day period is reached, whether substantial mental impairment is to be raised in a murder trial.

39Secondly, it is the case that Dr Westmore had provided two earlier reports (the latter in January 2012 before committal and arraignment) which did not raise substantial mental impairment. Once the trial date was fixed on 2 March 2012, it was at least desirable that the solicitor for the Accused seek a further report from Dr Westmore promptly, so that notice could be given to permit the Crown to take necessary steps in a timely but not pressured manner, and for the Court to have an accurate understanding of the issues in the trial and its likely estimate and, in particular, so that the trial would be in a position to commence with a jury on the date fixed, namely 3 September 2012. I understand that Ms Duchen and Dr Westmore had a plan in place which was intended to lead to service of a report within the statutory time period. However, there was no leeway if a problem arose, as it did when the Accused was transferred to Parklea Correctional Centre.

40Thirdly, it is apparent that Professor Greenberg was required to undertake very substantial preparation, including two prison visits to the Accused, within a short period of time for the purpose of preparing his report. But for the willingness of Professor Greenberg to undertake these steps, the question of leave may have become a more lively one, with the possibility that the trial date would be vacated, and with the associated difficulties of delay and cost to the community.

41Fourthly, the late communication of substantial mental impairment in this case has given rise to a series of pretrial issues, which call for consideration and determination in the shadow of the trial, in a way which delayed the empanelment of the jury and had a potential to impact upon the allocation of Court resources. 

42I accept that there are some unusual features to this case. I emphasise that these matters are not being raised to be critical of Ms Duchen and Dr Westmore.

43There is some tension between ss.138(d) and 151 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and Clause 10 of Practice Note SC CL2. The purpose of s.138(d) is to require a statement of intent that substantial mental impairment is to be raised before the notice is actually given under s.151 (see [13] above). Yet, Clause 10 of the Practice Note does not require a s.138 defence response to be given until after the s.151 deadline has passed. 

44The experience in this trial suggests that amendment to Supreme Court practices may be appropriate, to reinforce the expectation of modern criminal trial case management that timely notice of substantial mental impairment will be given well in advance of a murder trial.

An Incident Between the Accused and X on 10 February 2011

45The various issues to be determined in this judgment relate, in one way or another, to the Crown's desire, subject to the rulings of the Court, to adduce evidence before the jury of a serious assault by the Accused upon his 15-year old former girlfriend, X, on 10 February 2011 and its consequences. I will refer to this young victim as X to prevent publication of her identity: s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. 

46The Accused was in custody, having been charged with an offence arising from this incident, at the time of his attack upon the deceased in the Liverpool Courthouse cell on 15 February 2011. 

47Given the issues in the trial, it is accepted by Mr Averre, counsel for the Accused, that the circumstances giving rise to this charge, and the arrest of the Accused, would be in evidence before the jury. However, there are two pieces of evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce which are objected to by the Accused:

(a) the recording of a ""000"" call made by X on 10 February 2011, in the course of the Accused's assault upon her, in which the Accused may be heard speaking in the background (Exhibits PTA and PTD);

(b) the ERISP conducted between Detective Senior Constable Aaron Turner and the Accused at the Cabramatta Police Station on 14 February 2011 concerning the assault upon X (Exhibits PTB and PTE).

48In addition, the Crown seeks to rely upon the evidence of the assault upon X, and the ERISP with the Accused on 14 February 2011, as tendency evidence. 

49Mr Averre accepted that the Agreed Statement of Facts concerning the assault on X ""has relevance in the context of what Dr Westmore says and doubtless what Professor Greenberg says"" and that it was ""inevitable that evidence in relation to that assault would be given some how"", with the areas of controversy being the ""000"" call and the ERISP of 14 February 2011 (PT6-7, 3 September 2012).

50It is sufficient to note in this judgment that the Accused pleaded guilty in March 2012 to a charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon X on 10 February 2011, and awaits sentence for that offence in the District Court. The Agreed Statement of Facts concerning this incident (Exhibit PTA) reveals the following events.

51About 2.30 am on Thursday, 10 February 2011, the Accused called X by mobile phone and argued with her, with X eventually agreeing to see the Accused. The Accused drove to a location near X's residence and collected her. They then drove to Cabramatta and purchased some cigarettes. They drove to a car park area in Lansvale. 

52The Accused and X had a conversation, which included the Accused making sexual advances towards her, with X refusing these advances and requesting that he take her home.

53As a result of X's rejection, the Accused became enraged. He said ""Do you wanna see me angry, do you wanna see me angry, I'll show you what angry is"". The Accused then hit X three to four times to the face whilst they were both inside the vehicle.

54The Accused then exited the vehicle by the driver's door and forcibly dragged X from the vehicle. The Accused continued to punch X numerous times whilst she was on the ground. The Accused also kicked and stomped on X whilst she was on the ground. 

55X called ""000"" and the call was recorded. The ""000"" call, which is the subject of objection, captures the following words (Exhibit PTA):


""OPERATOR: Please go ahead Telstra.
TELSTRA OPERATOR: xxx no request, no location.
OPERATOR: Police emergency go ahead.
X: No, no, I'm sorry.
OPERATOR: Hello. 


X: I'm sorry please leave me alone.
KAEWKLOM: ....(INAUDIBLE) ... Fucking ... bring fucking

people here, you fucking dog bitch.


X: I'm sorry please stop hitting me.
KAEWKLOM: Bitch.

OPERATOR: Hello can you hear me? Can you tell me the address? Where are you?

KAEWKLOM: I love you so much, you're fucking lucky bitch ... Fucking slut.

OPERATOR: Hello can you please tell me where you are? 

KAEWKLOM: Get up now.

X: (MOANING)
OPERATOR: Tell me the suburb that you're in?""

56X then lost consciousness. Her next memory was regaining consciousness in the Accused's vehicle.

57About 11.00 am on 10 February 2011, X recalls being driven by the Accused to her home. On the trip home, the Accused asked her if she was going tell anyone what happened. She said that she would not. The Accused asked what she would tell her mother. X said that she would tell her mother that she had been bashed in Cabramatta. The Accused said ""Good, because if you tell anyone about it and I find out, I'll make sure your fucked up eye is hanging out"".

58The Accused refused to drive X all the way home, and he dropped her off about 200 metres away. 

59X returned home and called her mother. Her mother returned home and saw X's injuries. X's mother immediately drove her to Fairfield Police Station and an ambulance was called. X originally told police that she had been assaulted by some girls in Cabramatta. She did this because she was afraid of the Accused.

60X was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital, and was treated for her injuries which included the following:

(a) fractured right eye socket;

(b) a laceration to the top of the head, two centimetres long and one centimetre deep;

(c) deep bruising to her facial area;

(d) tenderness to the left abdomen;

(e) red marks to the neck area;

(f) abrasions/swelling to her knees and foot.

61About 10.30 pm on 14 February 2011, the Accused voluntarily attended Cabramatta Police Station and asked to speak with the detectives. The Accused was arrested, cautioned and returned to the custody area by Detective Senior Constable Aaron Turner, where he was introduced to the Custody Manager (Sergeant Bijay Chand) and informed of his rights under Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. 

62The Accused was escorted to an interview room and participated in an electronically recorded interview. In the course of the ERISP, to which objection is also taken by the Accused, the Accused admitted that on the night of 9 February 2011, he drank a significant amount of beer and spirits. He said that he received a telephone call from X asking him to pick her up from Cabramatta. He then drove to the bus stop near the train station and collected her. He said that, when she got into the car, X was bleeding and bruised. He drove her to the car park at Lansvale and they talked. He alleged that X told him she had been assaulted by some Asian girls and refused to go to the hospital. The Accused then suggested that X may have made up the allegation that he had assaulted her because he had slept with two of her friends, and also because X was seeing a psychologist. 

Partial Defence of Substantial Mental Impairment

63It is appropriate to refer briefly to relevant principles concerning substantial mental impairment and the anticipated contest between the evidence of Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg in this area.

64Section 23A(1) Crimes Act 1900 permits a person on trial for murder to be convicted of manslaughter in the following circumstances:

""(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:

(a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.""

65The onus lies upon the accused person to prove (on the balance of probabilities) that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of the section: s.23A(4).

66The first element of the partial defence (in s.23A(1)(a)) requires the capacity of the accused person to function, in one of the three ways mentioned in the subsection, to be substantially impaired. It is not sufficient if the accused person simply chose not to function in that way.

67An abnormality of mind occurs if the accused person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself, deviates from the normal variation in the ways in which people so function. It must be so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable person would term it abnormal. 

68The abnormality of mind must arise from an underlying condition, being a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind: s.23A(8).

69For the purpose of the second element (in s.23A(1)(b)), evidence of an opinion, that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter, is not admissible: s.23A(2).

70The issue under s.23A(1)(b) is a task for the jury, which must approach that task in a broad commonsense way, involving a value judgment by the jury representing the community, and not a finding of medical fact: R v Trotter (1993) 35 NSWLR 428 at 431. 

71An impairment must be so substantial as to warrant the reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter: R v Trotter at 431; R v Ryan (1995) 90 A Crim R 191 at 195; R v Majdalawi [2000] NSWCCA 240; 113 A Crim R 241 at 243 [10]-[11]. In R v Majdalawi, Adams J observed (at 247 [36]) that the ""value judgment by the jury representing the community"" to which Hunt CJ at CL referred in R v Ryan ""is a decision about culpability"" and hence ""is not a medical question"".

72Section 23A(1)(b) has been described as giving rise to ""an issue which is quintessentially one for the determination of a jury"": R v Hucker [2002] NSWSC 1068 at [2] (Howie J). 

73Accordingly, Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg cannot express an opinion on the second element in s.23A(1)(b) concerning the Accused.

74There is a live issue in this case as to whether the Accused has satisfied the first leg of substantial mental impairment in s.23A(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, before one gets to the quintessential jury question to be considered, as the second leg, under s.23A(1)(b) of the Act.

75There is a dispute between Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg as to whether the Accused was substantially impaired at the time of the relevant acts on 15 February 2011. 

76In his third report dated 10 August 2012 (part Exhibit PT1, page 2), Dr Westmore said:

""Following my recent meeting with Mr Kaewklom, I am of the view that the court should be given the opportunity to consider the defence of substantial impairment in this case on the basis that, on the balance of probability, Mr Kaewklom was suffering from the prodromal stage of the illness schizophrenia (at the time of the offence) which became fully expressed and later diagnosed when in prison. This (prodromal stage) is an underlying condition which I now believe lead to an abnormality of mind (fear, paranoia and probably anger) and that in turn impacted on his ability to control himself at the relevant time. It will be a matter for the court I think to determine whether or not he was substantially impaired.""
 
77In his report furnished on 4 September 2012 (Exhibit PTG), Professor Greenberg, for reasons explained in some detail in the report, said (page 27):

""I am therefore of the opinion that it is most unlikely that Mr Kaewklom had such an abnormality of mind at that time period. I am of the opinion that his mental state was not substantially impaired. I am of the opinion that he likely had the capacity to understand events and judge whether his actions were right or wrong and to control himself at that time period. This capacity was not in my view impaired by an underlying mental abnormality of the mind at that time period. However, the final determination is best left to the trier of fact.""

78A little later, Professor Greenberg said (page 27):

""I am of the opinion that at the time of the alleged offence Mr Kaewklom was likely tired, exhausted and angered and annoyed by the behaviour of the victim. He likely, in my view, acted in an angry manner. Mr Kaewklom had a pattern and history of aggression in his past. I am of the opinion that although there is a possibility that he may have a mental illness, the mental illness played no significant part in his alleged offending behaviour. I am therefore of the opinion that Mr Kaewklom likely does not have a partial defence of substantial impairment.""

Tendency Evidence

79By notice served on 6 August 2012, amended on 15 August 2012 (Exhibit PTF), the Crown gave notice of an intention to call evidence from Detective Senior Constable Turner outlining details of the offence that the Accused pleaded guilty to on 14 March 2012, that is recklessly causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s.35 Crimes Act 1900, being the offence committed against X. 

80Whilst acknowledging that the Accused concedes that this evidence is otherwise admissible in the trial, the Crown seeks its admission as well as tendency evidence, to demonstrate a tendency on the part of the Accused to act in a particular way with a particular state of mind. 

81In addition, the Crown submits that the evidence has the capacity to rebut the partial defence of substantial mental impairment relied upon by the Accused. 

82The tendency particularised in the tendency notice is:

(a) the tendency of the Accused, when angered, to physically assault the victim by positioning the victim on to the ground, by either dragging or throwing the victim, in order to use his feet to repeatedly kick and stomp the head and body of the victim; and

(b) the tendency of the Accused to perpetrate violence when angered.

83The evidence sought to be adduced as tendency evidence includes the Agreed Statement of Facts concerning the assault on X and the ERISP conducted on 14 February 2011, but not the ""000"" call made on 10 February 2011.

84Mr Averre submits that the proffered evidence does not have significant probative value for the purpose of s.97 Evidence Act 1995 and, in any event, the Court could not be satisfied that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the Accused for the purpose of s.101 of that Act.

85It is necessary to identify the facts in issue, the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence under consideration: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 at 316-317 [34]. Having done so, it is then necessary to consider whether the evidence in question has ""significant probative value"". The actual probative value of the evidence is a matter for the jury. The question to be determined is whether it is capable of having had that degree of probative value. This involves an assessment of the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the probability of the existence of the facts that are in issue: R v Fletcher at 316 [33].

86Subject to the balancing exercise imposed by s.101(2), evidence will be admissible under s.97 if it is evidence, the acceptance of which, beyond reasonable doubt, will render it more probable that, on a particular occasion relevant to the proceedings, the Accused acted in a particular way or had a particular state of mind: R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [33]-[46].

87Evidence that a person has a particular tendency is adduced in order to render more probable the proposition that, on a particular occasion relevant to the trial, that person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind), that is, to provide the foundation for an inference to that effect: Cittadini v R [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492 at 495 [22]-[23]; R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209 at [57]-[63].

88The prejudice with which s.101(2) is concerned is the risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way, for example, by provoking an irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves, or by distracting the jury: R v Ford at [56]. The proper carrying out of the balancing task requires the Judge to identify the type or types of prejudicial effect to which the evidence may give rise, and why it is that the Court has concluded that the probative value of the evidence does or does not substantially outweigh any such prejudicial effect: R v Ford at [64].

89This process requires, as well, the Court to consider the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be necessary or available to reduce the prejudicial effect: DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [104], [172].

90There are some unusual features to this case. 

91Firstly, as the Crown observed, unlike many tendency arguments, there is no issue raised by the defence in this case as to the admissibility of the evidence per se of the assault by the Accused upon X as it provides an explanation as to why the Accused was in custody when he attacked the deceased. 

92In addition, the incident is referred to in the reports of Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg in the context of the substantial mental impairment issue. 

93Secondly, there is no factual dispute that the Accused assaulted X, in the manner referred to, on 10 February 2011. Nor is there factual dispute that the Accused attacked the deceased, in the manner referred to, in the cell on 15 February 2011.

94Accordingly, the jury will be aware of these two events and the acts of the Accused in those events are not in contest. The present issue, however, centres upon the question whether the Crown can make use of this evidence as tendency evidence, with directions to be given to the jury to that effect. 

95The fact in issue in the case, to which the tendency evidence and direction is aimed, is the state of mind of the Accused at the time of the attack upon the deceased on 15 February 2011. The fact that the Accused, when angry, physically attacked X on 10 February 2011 in a manner which included kicking and stomping is, in my view, relevant and has significant probative value to an issue in the trial. That issue is whether, when angry, the Accused attacked the deceased on 15 February 2011 in a manner which involved kicking and stomping. 

96The s.101 inquiry involves the Court considering whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the Accused. It is the case that the jury will have this evidence before them, in any event, in the trial. This is not a case where, if the tendency evidence is disallowed, the jury will not be aware of the Accused's assault upon X on 10 February 2011. 

97I accept the Crown submission that this factor reduces, to a significant degree, the suggested prejudice which is said to flow from the admission of this evidence as tendency evidence. Directions may be fashioned to ensure that the evidence is used appropriately by the jury: R v Ford at [139], [140].

98It is also significant to the question of prejudice that there is no factual dispute that the Accused acted in the manner described in the incidents on 10 and 15 February 2011.

99I accept the Crown submission that, if the jury was persuaded that the Accused, only four days prior to the attack on the deceased, attacked his former girlfriend in anger when frustrated, the Crown could demonstrate a tendency to act in a particular way with a particular state of mind, this making it more likely, to a significant extent, that the Accused had so acted on the occasion of his attack upon the deceased, in a state of anger and frustration. This matter would bear strongly upon the issue of substantial mental impairment in the trial. 

100The similarity in the conduct of the Accused on each occasion, including the use of kicking and stomping, and the reasons for the use of such force, renders the evidence more probative of the facts in issue and relevant to the proposed partial defence to be raised by the Accused. 

101I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant and is capable of demonstrating a tendency of the Accused to act in a particular way (violently kicking and stomping his victim), with a particular state of mind (when angered or frustrated) and that this falls within s.97(1) of the Act. The evidence has significant probative value in the determination of the question whether the Accused is guilty of murder. The likelihood that such conduct occurred in the preceding week would make it more likely that the Accused acted in the way alleged for the particular reason alleged by the Crown on the occasion when he attacked the deceased on 15 February 2011.

102I am satisfied that the evidence has significant probative value that substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect.

103I propose to allow the evidence identified by the Crown to be adduced as tendency evidence in the trial of the Accused.

Admissibility of the ERISP dated 14 February 2011

104The Crown seeks to tender, through Detective Senior Constable Turner, the ERISP conducted with the Accused on 14 February 2011 concerning the assault upon X. The Crown submits that this ERISP is relevant and admissible on four principal bases:

(a) to prove the Accused's state of mind at a time closely proximate to the alleged murder;

(b) it forms part of a connecting series of events between 10 and 15 February 2011, culminating in the attack upon the deceased on 15 February 2011;

(c) it is relevant to the partial defence of substantial mental impairment sought to be proved by the Accused;

(d) it assists the Crown in proving the 10 February 2011 offence beyond reasonable doubt.

105Mr Averre objects to the tender of this ERISP on the grounds of relevance and, if relevant, upon the grounds that it would be unfairly prejudicial to the Accused (ss.135 and 137 Evidence Act 1995) and that it ought be excluded, in any event, as evidence obtained improperly or unlawfully under s.138 Evidence Act 1995. 

106Written submissions on behalf of the Crown and the Accused developed arguments in favour of and against the tender of the ERISP. In addition, evidence was given on the voir dire by Detective Senior Constable Turner and Sergeant Bijay Chand on issues relevant to the s.138 objection, to which I will return.

107I am satisfied that the ERISP conducted with the Accused on 14 February 2011 is relevant to issues to be determined in the trial. There is a particular, and unusual, area of relevance in this case. The Accused is charged with the murder of the deceased as a result of the attack upon him at about 10.35 am on 15 February 2011. The Accused has raised the partial defence of substantial mental impairment, as to which he carries the onus of proof on the civil standard. 

108The psychiatrists who will give evidence at the trial have had available to them contemporaneous visual images of the Accused at times before, during and after the attack upon the deceased in the cell. There is available:

(a) the ERISP with the Accused which commenced at 11.58 pm on 14 February 2011 and concluded at 1.44 am on 15 February 2011 - this interview provides an opportunity to observe and hear the Accused in conversation with police, on an occasion some nine-11 hours prior to the fatal attack - it constitutes a contemporaneous record of the Accused and a means by which his manner, affect and mental state may be assessed;

(b) the CCTV footage of the attack upon the deceased in the cell at about 10.35 am on 15 February 2011 provides a contemporaneous and graphic visual record of the acts of the Accused at that time;

(c) the ERISP conducted with the Accused between 3.30 pm and 4.05 pm on 15 February 2011 concerning the attack upon the deceased will be admitted, without objection, and will provide a further contemporaneous visual record of the Accused in a manner which allows observers to assess his manner, affect and mental state.

109Both Dr Westmore and, in particular, Professor Greenberg have derived assistance in an assessment of the mental state of the Accused from the ERISP conducted on 14 February 2011, prior to the attack upon the deceased.

110In circumstances where there is a live issue as between the expert psychiatrist witnesses as to whether the Accused was affected by an abnormality of mind at the time of the attack upon the deceased, this recorded interview of the Accused is capable of shedding very considerable light upon that topic.

111For that reason alone, I am satisfied that the ERISP is admissible in the trial, as part of evidence relevant to an assessment of whether the partial defence of substantial mental impairment is made out by the Accused. It will be for the jury to determine whether the Accused has established both the first and second legs of the partial defence under s.23A(1), and this contemporaneous visual evidence depicting the Accused is of significant probative value on those issues. 

112I do not accept the submission of Mr Averre that this ERISP of 14 February 2011 ought be excluded given that there will be other evidence of police officers and correctional officers and the Legal Aid solicitor who spoke to the Accused shortly prior to the fatal attack, and who can describe his manner and apparent mental state. Although that evidence is relevant to the Accused's mental state at the time of the fatal attack, it does not have the advantage of a contemporaneous visual and audio recording of the Accused, in conversation with the police, only hours prior to the fatal attack.

113I have had regard to the defence submission that it would be unfairly prejudicial to allow this evidence to be adduced in support of the contention that it ought be excluded under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995. It is the case that the evidence does have a prejudicial capacity, because the Accused in the ERISP is providing false denials to the police of having assaulted X. 

114However, the capacity of the Accused to engage with police in an extended conversation during that interview is, in my view, highly relevant to the substantial mental impairment issue. The psychiatrists refer to the account which he has given, including his denial of the earlier assault. The way in which the Accused interacts with the police is relevant to the substantial mental impairment issue.

115In my view, any prejudice which could result to the Accused because of his false denials in the ERISP may be balanced by appropriately fashioned directions. I am satisfied that the probative value of the ERISP outweighs any prejudicial effect and I decline to exclude it under s.135 Evidence Act 1995. I have considered whether the evidence ought be excluded under s.137 Evidence Act 1995 upon the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused. I am not satisfied that the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by the danger of any unfair prejudice to the Accused, and I decline to exclude it on that basis as well.

116Although it is not strictly necessary to consider the other bases upon which the Crown seeks to rely upon this evidence, I will shortly address them for the purpose of this ruling. 

117As to the first basis (at [104](a) above), I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant to prove the Accused's state of mind at a time proximate to the alleged offence of murder - this aspect, in reality, overlaps with the relevance already adverted to concerning the partial defence of substantial mental impairment. 

118As to the second basis (at [104](b) above), I am persuaded that this evidence, being the ERISP of 14 February 2011, may be characterised as being part of a connected series of events which may be considered as one transaction: O'Leary v The King [1946] HCA 44; 73 CLR 566 at 577; R v Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189; 106 A Crim R 510 at 516 [30]; R v Serratore [2001] NSWCCA 123 at [39]-[40]; R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304 at 324-326 [126]-[137]. In the unusual circumstances of this case, the events set in train by the Accused's assault upon X on 10 February 2011, his attendance at the police station on the evening of 14 February 2011, the ERISP which then took place, the fact that he was charged and bail refused and thereby kept in custody, set the scene for the fatal attack upon the deceased in the cell on the morning of 15 February 2011.

119With respect to the first and second bases relied upon by the Crown, I accept the Crown submission that it is an available rational inference that when the Accused handed himself into the Cabramatta Police Station at 10.30 pm on 14 February 2011, he expected to give his false account and walk out of the police station without being charged. He attempted to joke with the police initially, and to steer their investigation away from him by giving a premeditated false story. However, the police did not believe this account and the Accused was charged and bail was refused, leading to him being confined in the cell near the deceased who was yelling abuse and behaving in an irritating fashion. 

120I accept, in the unusual circumstances of this case, that this may be regarded as a connected series of events, which is capable of shedding light upon the Accused's state of mind at the time of the attack upon the deceased in the cell later that morning. It may serve to explain why he was angry and frustrated, although it will be a matter for the jury to determine whether the Crown argument to this effect ought be accepted. 

121As to the fourth basis (at [104](d) above), I am not persuaded that this evidence is relevant to assist the Crown in proving the 10 February 2011 assault upon X beyond a reasonable doubt. There will be an admission by the Accused that he assaulted X and has pleaded guilty to that charge, so that this leg of the Crown's argument ought not be upheld.

122I turn to the objections based upon s.138 Evidence Act 1995. As initially advanced, Mr Averre objected to the admissibility of the ERISP of 14 February 2011 upon the following bases:

(a) that the Accused had been unlawfully arrested for the purpose of questioning;

(b) that the Accused was a ""vulnerable person"", being a person from a non-English speaking background, so that a support person should have been offered to him for the purpose of the ERISP;

(c) that there had been a failure to comply with appropriate procedures to explain the Accused's right to consult a lawyer.

123An objection under s.138 Evidence Act 1995 involves a two-stage process: Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; 83 ALJR 494 at 500-501 [28]-[29]. At the first stage, the onus lies upon the Accused to establish impropriety or illegality for the purpose of an objection under s.138 Evidence Act 1995. The Accused must discharge this onus on the balance of probabilities, but with the principle in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336 kept in mind: R v Petroulias (No. 6) [2006] NSWSC 1422; 182 A Crim R 1 at 6 [21]; R v Petroulias (No. 8) [2007] NSWSC 82 at [11]-[18]. 

124If the Accused establishes impropriety or illegality, the burden then falls upon the party seeking admission of the evidence to persuade the Court that it should be admitted: s.138(1) and (3); Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs at 500-501 [28]-[29].

125The evidence of Detective Senior Constable Turner and Sergeant Chand on the voir dire did not assist the Accused in support of these grounds of objection.

126As to the arrest ground, I am not satisfied that the Accused has established impropriety or illegality. It has not been demonstrated that the Accused was arrested for the purpose of questioning.

127The evidence of Detective Senior Constable Turner, taken with the documentary evidence and the evidence of Sergeant Chand, reveals that the Accused attended the police station at about 10.30 pm on 14 February 2011. The COPS entry concerning the assault upon X (Exhibit PTK) was accessed by Detective Senior Constable Turner. That document made clear that X, although originally asserting that the Accused had not assaulted her, had informed police that the Accused had in fact done so and that the Accused had sought to dissuade her from revealing the true facts. 

128The COPS entry also disclosed that the police had been looking for the Accused, without success, for the purpose of arresting and charging him with the assault upon X and to serve an apprehended violence order on him. 

129Accordingly, the COPS entry provided a proper foundation for Detective Senior Constable Turner to reasonably suspect that the Accused had committed an offence and that arrest was appropriate. 

130Further, I accept the evidence of Detective Senior Constable Turner that arrest was appropriate in this case by operation of s.99(3) Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, given the need to ensure the appearance of the Accused before Court in respect of the offence, the need to prevent a repetition of the offence and, in particular, to prevent harassment of or interference with X, to prevent fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence and to preserve the safety or welfare of X (s.99(3)(a)-(f)). 

131It is the case that Detective Senior Constable Turner did not inform the Accused that he was arresting him for these reasons. However, the Accused was informed that he was being arrested for the assault upon X. The COPS entry provided a solid foundation for the factors referred to in s.99(3) to which Detective Senior Constable Turner adverted to in his evidence. There was a proper and reasonable basis for the police officer to consider that arrest was necessary to protect X and to guard against any further harassment of her, in circumstances where there was evidence suggesting that this had already occurred since the offence committed against her on 10 February 2011. 

132In any event, it is difficult to see how arrest for the purposes of questioning may be found in this case. The Accused had attended the police station, no doubt in the expectation that he would be questioned about the assault on X. After some initial questions were asked of the Accused by Detective Senior Constable Turner, the Accused was informed he was under arrest and was then processed by way of Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, before he was sought to be interviewed by way of ERISP. The effect of this was that the Accused was informed fully of his rights by Sergeant Chand, in a manner which re-emphasised the fact that he did not have to answer questions if he did not wish to, and that he could seek to speak to a lawyer or a friend if he so wished. Thereafter, Detective Senior Constable Turner interviewed the Accused and the Accused participated in the interview.

133I am simply not persuaded that any impropriety has been demonstrated here by way of the arrest of the Accused for questioning.

134The second basis of objection - that the Accused was a ""vulnerable person"" - was ultimately not pressed by Mr Averre, after attention was drawn to the definition of ""person of non-English background"" in s.3 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. That definition states that ""a person of non-English speaking background"" is one ""who is born in a country outside Australia and whose first language is not English"". The submission was made initially upon the basis that the Accused's mother had Thai as her first language, and required a Thai interpreter to give a statement to police and that this feature was relevant to the issue of the Accused's vulnerability.

135The question was whether the Accused was a person ""born in a country outside Australia ... whose first language is not English"". It is plain that the purpose of this class of ""vulnerable person"" is to provide a measure of assistance or protection to a person with a significant difficulty in speaking and understanding the English language.

136Although it is the case that the Accused was born in Thailand, the evidence makes clear that his first language is English. He came to Australia when he was six years' old and, even at that time, he could speak English. Further, it is apparent that all persons who have spoken to him, including police officers, the Legal Aid solicitor and psychiatrists have been able to converse with him readily in English. The ERISP of 14 February 2011 was conducted in English without any difficulty on the part of the Accused.

137The evidence of Sergeant Chand revealed a practical and constructive approach on his part to the determination that the Accused had a good understanding of the English language. A practical approach by a custody manager, for the purpose of an assessment as to whether a person is a ""vulnerable person"", is what is to be expected in the setting of a police station, where issues of this type arise for consideration: Spurling v R [2006] NSWCCA 245 at [21].

138The submission based upon the ""vulnerable person"" issue was ultimately not pressed but, in any event, was without merit.

139The third head of objection under s.138 was that there was impropriety or illegality in the way in which the Accused was informed of his rights to consult a lawyer. The evidence of Sergeant Chand, which I accept, outlined the process adopted in his discussion, as Custody Manager, with the Accused. 

140That discussion included a clear statement that the police will help the Accused to contact the lawyer of his choice, if he wanted legal advice or to ask that person to come to the police station. The Accused provided a written acknowledgement that he had been given such advice (Exhibit PTM). 

141Thereafter, the Accused was interviewed by Detective Senior Constable Turner in the ERISP. Early in that interview, the police officer confirmed with the Accused that he had been advised of his rights by Sergeant Chand. The Accused had with him in the interview room a copy of the written acknowledgement.

142It was only after the interview was complete at 1.44 am on 15 February 2011, and the Custody Manager was about to be called into the room, that the Accused said (Exhibit PTB, Q/A708, page 66):

""I thought I could get legal advice before I could speak to youse.""

143Soon after, Sergeant Chand came into the room and he asked the Accused (Exhibit PTB, Q/A722-724, page 67):

""Q722. Have you any complaints to make about the manner in which you were interviewed?
A. No. Although I always thought that I was able to contact legal advice before I spoke to ...

Q723. Which is something I had spoke to you about when I was reading your rights to you.
A. Um ...

Q724. You never told me that you wanted to contact anyone. All right. I get the guys to come back and finish the interview off. OK?""

144In my view, these comments by the Accused emphasise the fact that, at all times, he was aware that he could seek legal advice if he wanted to do so. It may readily be inferred that he understood what Sergeant Chand had told him in this respect before the ERISP. However, the Accused did not ask Sergeant Chand if he could contact a lawyer, nor did he raise the issue with Detective Senior Constable Turner as the ERISP commenced. Rather, at the end of the ERISP, he raised the issue for the first time. 

145It is noteworthy that the Accused was again reminded, after the ERISP, of his right to contact a lawyer before a forensic procedure (the taking of a buccal swab) took place. The Accused did not seek to contact a lawyer at that time.

146I am simply not persuaded that there is any impropriety or illegality at all in the manner complained of by the Accused. He was aware of his right to contact a lawyer, but he did not exercise that right and only raised the topic at the end of the ERISP. 

147I reject the third ground of objection based on s.138 Evidence Act 1995.

148As the Accused has not established any impropriety or illegality, it is strictly not necessary to consider how the relevant discretion would be exercised in the event that impropriety or illegality had been demonstrated. However, I express the view, for the purposes of s.138(1) and (3) Evidence Act 1995, that if (contrary to my findings) any impropriety or illegality had been established, it would be technical in nature and that the probative value of the evidence, the nature of the charge of murder and other factors contained in s.138(3), when appropriately considered, would have seen the admission of the evidence in any event.
 
The ""000"" Call on 10 February 2011

149The Crown submitted that evidence of the ""000"" call (see [55] above) and, in particular, the words spoken by the Accused during that call, are admissible. It was submitted that this evidence forms part of the connected series of events and is evidence of the Accused's state of mind at that time. It was argued that it demonstrates that the Accused was furious, and should be considered in conjunction with his statement to X, immediately preceding the assault, ""Do you wanna see me angry, you wanna see me angry, I'll show you what angry is"". 

150The Crown submits that the evidence of the words spoken by the Accused during the ""000"" call makes the attack on the deceased on 15 February 2011 more explicable, comprehensible and able to be understood as the result of anger on the part of the Accused.

151Further, the Crown submitted that the Accused's account of the assault on X, as given to Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg, was pertinent to the partial defence of substantial mental impairment. The accounts given by the Accused to Professor Greenberg concerning the ""000"" call and the assault on X have fluctuated somewhat. The Crown contends that the ""000"" call provides the best evidence of what the Accused was saying at that point, and the way in which he was saying it.

152The Crown submitted that this evidence is pertinent, as well, to a proper understanding by the jury of matters bearing upon the substantial mental impairment issue.

153Mr Averre submitted that the ""000"" call was not relevant but that, in any event, it ought be excluded under s.135 or s.137 Evidence Act 1995 upon the basis of unfair prejudice. He pointed to the time gap between the ""000"" call on 10 February 2011 and the attack upon the deceased on 15 February 2011. He submitted that it was remote in time from the events directly relevant to this trial. Mr Averre submitted that the Accused's statements during the ""000"" call did not advance the Crown case, particularly in circumstances where he admitted his guilt with respect to the assault upon X. 

154I approach the objection to this evidence upon the basis that evidence of the assault upon X, and the ERISP of 14 February 2011, will be before the jury. In addition, a factor pointing strongly in favour of the admission of this evidence is that it is a further contemporaneous recording disclosing the words of the Accused, and the tone of those words, in connection to an event which is relevant to the trial, being the assault upon X. 

155The Accused having raised substantial mental impairment, his state of mind and his conduct, including the assault upon X and his anger, are relevant to the issues in this trial. The ""000"" call captures the sound of what the Accused said on this occasion and the tone in which he said it.

156I am satisfied that this evidence is relevant to issues in the trial, including the issue of substantial mental impairment raised by the Accused. I am satisfied as well that this aspect may be seen as part of a connected series of events in the manner referred to earlier in this judgment.

157I do not consider that the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by unfair prejudice to the Accused so as to warrant its rejection under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995.

158I allow the Crown to adduce evidence of the ""000"" call and the recording of that call in the Crown case.
 
The Pretrial Rulings

159Having considered the evidence and submissions arising from the pretrial hearing on 3 and 4 September 2012, I announced the following rulings on 5 September 2012 (T14):

Admissibility of ERISP of 14 February 2011

160I allow the Crown to adduce evidence of the ERISP of 14 February 2011 concerning the assault on X upon the basis that this evidence:

(a) is relevant to the partial defence of substantial mental impairment raised by the Accused; 

(b) is relevant to establish the Accused's state of mind at a time close to the alleged offence of murder; 

(c) is capable of forming part of a connecting series of events culminating in the alleged murder.

161The accused has not established any impropriety or illegality with respect to the ERISP for the purposes of s.138 Evidence Act 1995, and I decline to exclude it under that section.

162I also decline to exclude the ERISP of 14 February 2011 under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995.

The ""000"" Call on 10 February 2011

163I allow the Crown to adduce evidence of the ""000"" call made on 10 February 2011 upon the basis that this evidence: 

(a) is relevant to the partial defence of substantial mental impairment raised by the Accused; 

(b) is relevant to the Accused's state of mind at a time not distant from the alleged murder; 

(c) is capable of forming part of a connected series of events culminating in the alleged murder.

164I decline to exclude the ""000"" call under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995.

The Tendency Evidence

165I allow the Crown to adduce tendency evidence in the manner identified in the tendency notice dated 15 August 2012, and the jury will be so directed at the appropriate time. 

166The reasons contained in this judgment explain the rulings announced by me on 5 September 2012.

167By way of postscript, I record the fact that, on 5 September 2012, the Accused pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown did not accept that plea in discharge of the indictment. A jury was empanelled and the trial of the Accused proceeded. On 10 September 2012, the Accused requested that he be rearraigned before the jury. On this occasion, the Accused pleaded guilty to murder. In accordance with s.157 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the jury was discharged from giving a verdict and the Court found the Accused guilty of murder and convicted him of that offence. A sentence hearing was fixed for 17 September 2012.

		18 September 2012",2012-09-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760097,R. v. Michael Anthony Ryan (No. 5) [2012] NSWSC 1159,"Ex tempore Judgment

1Mr Ryan is standing trial on two counts. The first count relates to the alleged manslaughter of Mr Connan McLeod by an unlawful and dangerous act; that act allegedly occurred in what has been called in the evidence the KFC carpark at Windsor. The second count relates to an event which allegedly occurred a little earlier in time. The allegation is of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a Mr Mitchell Poile. That matter allegedly occurred in the George Street mall outside the Fitzroy Hotel at Windsor.

2Mr McLeod and Mr Poile were related in the sense of being, at least on a de facto basis, brothers-in-law, and they went out together on that evening of 30th April and 1st May 2011. It is unnecessary for me to detail the full circumstances of their evening out or, indeed, of all the surrounding circumstances relating to these two charges.

3Mr Ryan has pleaded not guilty to both counts and although there have been some interruptions, for legitimate purposes, we are on the afternoon of the Tuesday of the fifth week of the trial. The Crown case has closed and the defence has gone into evidence. As things presently stand, Mr Ryan is giving evidence, some evidence-in-chief being taken yesterday afternoon.

4At around 3.30pm yesterday afternoon counsel agreed that we adjourn early. Mr Waterstreet for the defence wanted to review his position, to consider whether there was any further evidence he wished to lead from Mr Ryan, and Mr Crown wanted to review his position in order to cross-examine Mr Ryan in the one hit, as it were. I thought this was a sensible application.

5I should recount that at the close of the prosecution case at about 12:45pm yesterday, Mr Waterstreet applied for a Prasad direction, as it is called. The Crown had no opposition to that application. The application had been foreshadowed a few days ago and I had received some assistance from both counsel about the matter at that time. Accordingly, I acceded to the application and gave the direction before the jury took the usual break for lunch at about 1 o'clock.

6Just before the resumption at 2 o'clock I received two notes from the jury, which I, in accordance with the usual practise, showed to counsel. Those notes are marked MFI 29 and 30, respectively. MFI 29 informed me, perhaps unnecessarily, that the jury had decided they could not unanimously agree on a not guilty verdict on both counts. When they returned to court, the foreman clarified that 'both' meant, 'either or both'. However, at about the same time, the jury sent MFI 30 which has been read on to the record, and which I will read again for the purpose of these reasons: 

The jury has requested clarification on if we will have the opportunity to view CCTV footage in the jury room due to difficulty in seeing clearly due to distance in court.

7I have read it as it appears in writing. There was some discussion with counsel about this note. At that stage counsel considered that the jury could have the opportunity to view the CCTV footage. When the jury came into court it became apparent, as will appear from the transcript, that after I assured them they would have full access to the footage after they retire to consider their verdicts I received an indication that they preferred to go on with the trial rather than pause at that stage to view it. With no disrespect, no application was made by counsel at that time in relation to the continuation of the trial.

8I should interpolate before dealing with the application that when discussing the CCTV footage with the jury yesterday afternoon, I gave them a direction that they should exercise care and caution in looking at the CCTV footage, so as not to give it disproportionate weight over other evidence.

9This morning or, rather, apparently when they went home yesterday afternoon, the jury left a note with the Sheriff's officer for me which became MFI 31. That note is in these terms:

We regret the CCTV request has created the impression that it has undue importance. We were unsure only if we would have the opportunity to view it clearly in the jury room along with all other evidence. We do not ask to see it specifically prior to other evidence.

I have recited it as written.

10Following this note the jury came into court this morning and a further explanation was given. Before the jury came in, Mr Waterstreet articulated an application to discharge the jury on the basis that it was apparent, having regard to the terms of MFI 30 particularly, that there was a possibility that the jury may not have fully perceived the evidence as it was given, and therefore Mr Ryan could not have a fair trial.

11During the course of argument I was reminded that as long ago as 24 August 2012, which was the Friday of the first week of the trial, the parties had agreed that the jury could have access in the jury room to the CCTV footage that had by then been shown. At that point in time not all of it, as events transpired, was available because further CCTV footage was produced by the Crown on the following Monday, further enquiries having been made of the Fitzroy Hotel.

12However, both parties had inspected the laptop that the court could provide to the jury. The Crown had prepared a list of instructions in operating the available CCTV footage, which I marked MFI 9. I informed the jury of this in the following manner at 192T, .5 -10:

Can I say this, that we will, during the first break of the day, equip your jury room with a laptop, as I have already mentioned, with a copy of exhibits we saw yesterday which are contained on discs as well as the ISRAP document. You can look at those when you're all present together in the jury room.

13I very much regret to say, notwithstanding my assurance to the jury, the laptop was not put in the jury room; nor have I made available the exhibits which are exhibits G, H, K and M, to be viewed by the jurors when they are all present at the one time. This is entirely my responsibility as trial Judge.

14By way of narrative only, I add that although I have had some communications from the jury over the course of this trial, no request was made of me in relation to these exhibits until I received MFI 30.

15I should say that the CCTV footage has assumed great evidential importance in this trial. The footage was recorded on three cameras located in and about the Fitzroy Hotel. One camera is affixed to the exterior wall and picks up events in a portion of George Street mall, directly outside the hotel. The second is above and inside the entry doorway. And the third is in the front bar or poolroom, affixed in one corner, but picking up a view of the bar itself, the pool table and a fair proportion of the room, showing the comings and goings of patrons in that area. These are three of many cameras within the hotel, according to the evidence of Ms Sieders.

16As I said, the evidence has assumed great importance in the trial because it depicts relevant events. In particular it depicts events inside the pool room which are capable of bolstering a line of defence that the first interaction between Mr Ryan and Messrs McLeod and Poile actually happened inside the hotel when, on Mr Ryan's account given to the police and in court yesterday, Mr McLeod and Mr Poile were taking the ""rise out of him"", to use the vernacular expression, earlier in the evening.

17Although that is not clearly depicted in the footage, one can deduce enough of certain events in the top right-hand corner of the screen, when one views it, to get a real sense of what Mr Ryan has described.

18The camera above the door is not really material: it just shows Mr Ryan entering the hotel at a specified time. 

19The camera outside the hotel shows a number of important events that took place in the mall. It shows - I won't describe all of it - Mr Ryan at the door of the hotel remonstrating with security guards about allowing his fiancée, Ms Davey, and a friend, Ms Monish, to enter the hotel to use the toilets. This happened more than once, but on the particular occasion I am describing, it happened to coincide with the ejection of Mr Poile from the hotel for intoxication. Mr McLeod left, according to the evidence, under his own steam at or about the same time and is also shown on this footage. One clearly sees events unfold which are directly relevant to the second count, and indirectly relevant to the first. Those events show the interaction between Mr Ryan on the one hand and Mr McLeod and Mr Poile on the other, leading up to what is shown at the very periphery of the screen as a punch apparently thrown by Mr Ryan which connects with Mr Poile.

20Mr Ryan admits, and has always admitted, this punch. He says, and has always said, that it was thrown in self-defence. And from the line of cross-examination of the eyewitnesses by Mr Waterstreet, one can appreciate an interpretation of what is depicted in the video, understood in the light of the evidence adduced from the witnesses, that contrary to the case presented for the Crown, Mr McLeod and Mr Poile were acting aggressively towards Mr Ryan and, in fact, moving in on him, as I understand the argument, in the moments leading up to the punch being thrown.

21As I say, this is one interpretation and to make it one has to depend upon not only what one sees on the screen but also on what the eye witnesses have said about those images under the careful and thorough cross-examination of Mr Waterstreet. Certainly that is an interpretation well open to the jury if they ever have to make a decision in this case. 

22Of course, none of that evidence directly shows anything occurring in the KFC carpark but, as I have said, it is indirectly relevant. There may be more than one way of putting it. Suffice for present purposes for me to say that one may interpret those images, in light of the evidence heard in this court, as showing that Mr McLeod and Mr Poile were the aggressors. After the security guards separated - I use this expression neutrally - the combatants, from what is depicted on the screen one might infer that Mr Poile and Mr McLeod evinced a preparedness to ""go on with it"". One might think then that this material casts some light on what subsequently happened in the car park.

23In particular, the evidence in the case demonstrates that neither Mr Poile nor Mr McLeod had any business going to the car park on 1st May 2011. It was their intention, according to Mr Poile's evidence and from the inferences one might eventually draw from the other evidence in the case, to proceed south down George Street to Mr Poile's home which was near the Windsor Railway Station. To get to the car park one has to divert from that journey turning left to Fitzroy Street, and turn left again into the carpark driveway. There is no evidence they had a car there, even if one of them had intended to drive in his intoxicated condition. The only plausible explanation for Mr McLeod going there, according to the evidence I heard, and this is entirely a matter for the jury, was to take up his grievances with Mr Ryan - if I can put the matter in that neutral way - whose party had gone down a lane way into the carpark from the mall.

24In any event, Mr Ryan's evidence is consistent with the evidence of other witnesses that when he entered the car park from the end of the laneway that runs down beside the Commonwealth Bank, Mr McLeod was at the far end, and when he saw Mr Ryan emerge he ran across the car park yelling out abusive language including ""I'm going to kill you"". Mr Ryan said he acted at all times to protect himself and to protect the others in his group, which included three young women. I will not go into the detail of what Mr Ryan said happened but the men interacted in a physical way. Mr McLeod fell and struck his head heavily on the pavement. He suffered a severe traumatic brain injury from the effects of which he died on 4 May, 2011. On the evidence, and it is for the Crown to negative it, there is ample scope for the tribunal of fact to accept the account given by Mr Ryan that whatever happened occurred in self-defence, leaving aside other issues that will be left to the jury if they are not discharged.

25The CCTV footage has been used extensively in the examination of witnesses in this trial. It was shown initially in the Crown case. I have seen parts of it on the voir dire and each of the eye witnesses to different parts of the events in question, whom I will name, have been cross-examined extensively by reference to it whilst it was shown to them on the screens in court in the presence of the jury. In particular Mr Jay Willis, Ms. Heidi Sieders, Mr Stuart Miller, Mr Mitchell Moody and Ms Holly Monish have been shown all or part of the CCTV footage during the course of the cross-examination by Mr Waterstreet. The evidence adduced has been adduced by reference to the images shown on the screen as the witness was questioned, and the jury were required to pay close attention to all of the evidence including, necessarily for this purpose, what was then depicted on the screen.

26Although this is an historic courtroom it is fitted with modern equipment. Relevantly, there are two large video screens on either sidewall of the court. One is directly opposite the jury box and the other is behind the jury box, but a little offset on the wall. During the course of the playing of the videos and the evidence I have described, I have been looking at the CCTV footage on a small monitor with which the Bench is fitted, but at the same time I have been keeping an eye on the jury and I have seen all of them attentively looking at the screen, although it must be said in respect of that second screen on the wall behind them that to see it they have to turn in their seats and crane their necks. However, as I said, there was no suggestion made during the whole course of this trial so far until the receipt of MFI 30 that anyone had any difficulty following what was being depicted on the screen and following the evidence that was being adduced in the cross-examination by Mr Waterstreet.

27Mr Waterstreet's application, of course, is that from MFI 30 and to some extent MFI 31, it must be said that the jury had difficulty clearly viewing the CCTV footage. As I have said, Mr Waterstreet argues that if they had difficulty in viewing it they would have had difficulty following the evidence and, accordingly, given the length of this trial, Mr Ryan may have been deprived his opportunity of having a fair trial according to law. 

28With the consent of counsel the court provided the laptop, and provided the exhibits to the jury and requested them to take the time this morning to view the CCTV footage in the privacy of the jury-room notwithstanding their stated preference for hearing further evidence, expressed yesterday afternoon. When that was done the jury returned to court this afternoon. Following discussion with counsel in the absence of the jury and with their consent, I asked four jurors three questions. Following further discussion with counsel I asked all of the jury the third question again, asking any juror who wished to give a different answer to that expressed by the four questioned individually to raise his or her hand. None of the jury raised a hand.

29My questioning of the jury proceeded in the following way (1327 - 1330T):

HIS HONOUR: Good afternoon, members of the jury. Just before we continue, I'd just like to ask some of you some questions about the notes you sent through yesterday and this morning which are MFI 30 and MFI 31 in these proceedings. It is not practicable for me to ask you all questions, but I propose to ask three or four of you some questions just so I can better understand what it is you were saying to me in the notes that you sent. This happens sometimes. And only because you're the foreman, Mr Foreman, I might start with you, if I may. Although, as I said at the outset, you're the spokesperson, your vote carries the same weight as everyone else. Don't worry, I will include you all in some way in the process.

My first question, Mr Foreman, is this: Having seen the CCTV footage at close range, are you still of the view that any difficulty in seeing it clearly was due to the distance in court? 

FOREPERSON: I think that was one of the major problems is the distance for some of the members. 

HIS HONOUR: Two more questions for you and I will ask some of the others in a moment the same questions but think about your answers as I'm asking the foreman. 

My next question was, having seen it at close range did you think any difficulty rather was due to the quality of the footage?

FOREMAN: Well the main thing we were looking at is the conflict. It is a bit out of range of the camera so it is a bit difficult but I believe now we have got a better look. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. My next and final question is, having seen it now at close range do you feel you were at any disadvantage in following the evidence and particularly the evidence adduced by Mr Waterstreet in crossexamination of the witnesses because of the distance you were from the screen? 

FOREMAN: I don't think that is the case, personally. 

HIS HONOUR: I am asking you personally. Perhaps I can ask, I won't ask the lady behind you, it looks like I am being geographically prejudiced, perhaps the lady on the end of the second row may I ask you the same questions and I will ask them again so you can hear it afresh; having seen the CCTV footage at close range are you still of the view that any difficulty in seeing it clearly was due to the distance in court? 

FEMALE JUROR: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you think any of the difficulty was rather due to the quality of the footage?

FEMALE JUROR: In part yes, some detail was hard to pick up being so far away. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, having seen it now at close range do you feel you were at any disadvantage in following the evidence adduced, including the evidence adduced by Mr Waterstreet in crossexamination, because of your distance from the screen?

FEMALE JUROR: Not specifically because I think we were seeing some of the things that were being pointed out. 

HIS HONOUR: All right now second from the end in the back row sir if I could ask you the same questions if you would not mind. I will just consult my notes so I ask you in the same form; having seen the CCTV footage at close range are you still of the view that any difficulty in seeing it clearly was due to distance in court? 

MALE JUROR: Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you think any difficulty was rather due to the quality of the footage?

MALE JUROR: No 

HIS HONOUR: Having seen it now at close range do you feel you were at any disadvantage in following the evidence including the evidence adduced by Mr Waterstreet in crossexamining because of the distance from the screen?

MALE JUROR: No. 

HIS HONOUR: I will ask one more person if I may. I might ask you sir on the end of the front row. Having seen the CCTV footage at close range are you still of the view that any difficulty in seeing it clearly was due to the distance in court?

SECOND MALE JUROR: I think yes but I think those of us who were looking behind us seeing the screen there, there was comments being made you could see it so much more clearly and I think it was just a better case of everyone having an equal opportunity to have that close vantage point. 

HIS HONOUR: All right I will ask you the same two additional questions sir if I may; do you think any difficulty was rather due to the quality of the footage?

SECOND MALE JUROR: I don't think so. 

HIS HONOUR: Having seen it now at close range do you feel you were at any disadvantage in following the evidence including the evidence adduced by Mr Waterstreet in crossexamination because of your distance from the screen?

SECOND MALE JUROR: I don't think so. Because we saw it a number of times I don't think that is the case. 

HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen I do not want to exclude anybody. I think it is fair to say what I heard from the four people I asked they gave me very, very similar responses but if any of you wish to say anything about the three questions I have asked, in particular if any of you would give me a different response to any one of those three questions would you please identify yourself to me by raising your hand. Well I cannot see any hands raised so I take it you are all of the same view expressed by members of the jury I have asked the specific questions to. All right thank you. 

WATERSTREET: May I suggest one thing. 

HIS HONOUR: Would you write it out for me Mr Waterstreet.

WATERSTREET: Yes I can write it out.

HIS HONOUR: I am happy to consider any additional questions, is that what you would like me to do? 

WATERSTREET: It just arose from the answer the learned foreman gave in relation to the qualification of the third question. 

HIS HONOUR: What note did you make? 

WATERSTREET: ""Not personally"" 

HIS HONOUR: Yes Mr Foreman when you said to me ""not personally"" were you using that expression just to make it clear to me that you were speaking purely for yourself?

FOREMAN: That is correct. 

WATERSTREET: The query I had was only in relation to the third question and whether anyone felt at a disadvantage. 

HIS HONOUR: I will ask the whole jury the third question. Now members of the jury what I am going to ask you is the same question in the same terms which I have asked of four of your members specifically. If any one of you felt you were at a disadvantage of the type that I have asked about in the question I would like you to raise your hand please, do you understand me? All right so I am asking the third question of all of you on that premise I have given you; having seen the CCTV footage now at close range do you feel you were at any disadvantage in following the evidence including the evidence adduced by Mr Waterstreet in crossexamination because of your distance from the screen? If any one would like to give a different answer to those I have heard to that question please raise your hand. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. 

No hands were raised gentlemen. 

All right I apologise once again for the fact you didn't have what I said you would have and the exhibits have been returned to me. It is normal you will get them all back after my summingup. If in the meantime you wish me to, we may need them in court while the evidence is happening, but if at any other time you would like to see these DVDs or copies of the CCTV footage again please just send me a note making that request. Just while you were out an issue did arise that I have to decide. Would you bear with me one more time and go back to the jury room while I resolve that question. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. 

30As may be seen from this excerpt, I asked the jury three questions: 

(1)Having seen the CCTV footage at close range are you still of the view that any difficulty in seeing it clearly was due to the distance in court?
(2)Do you think any difficulty was rather due to the quality of the footage?
(3)Having seen it now at close range do you feel you were at any disadvantage in following the evidence, including the evidence adduced by Mr Waterstreet in cross-examination, because of your distance from the screen?""

31The four jurors I questioned individually - three men and one woman, from a jury of six men and six women - still maintained they had difficulty seeing the CCTV footage clearly due to the distance in court. One of them thought some of the difficulty may have been due to the quality of the footage but the other three answered that question in the negative. All of them answered the third question to the effect that they had no disadvantage of the type described. As I have said I asked the third question of all of the jury and no member of it indicated to me any disadvantage. I should add that the third question was added to two I had prepared myself following discussion with counsel including learned counsel for the defence, at whose suggestion the latter was framed.

32Naturally what the jury say cannot be determinative but it is clearly, in my opinion, a very relevant consideration. 

33In Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 at page 440 Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in the joint judgment indicated that the question of discharging the jury is a discretionary one for the trial judge. The criterion for its exercise is the maintenance of the fairness of the trial. The test for discharge of the jury is one of necessity. By that latter criterion I understand their Honours to mean that the power should be exercised whenever it is necessary to do so to ensure that the accused enjoys the right of all members of our community to have a fair trial, particularly in criminal proceedings.

34Their Honours went on to say at 440-441:

No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of contested issues; the stage of which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these things and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading a transcript.

The last sentence of course is more relevant to an appellate court than a trial court.

35Mr Waterstreet also drew my attention to a decision in R v Rohatgi (unreported, NSWCCA 4 November 1992 No 60328 of 1990). At page 18 of his judgment, Clarke JA (Hunt CJ at CL and Sully J agreeing) said of a trial in which critical expert testimony of three medical practitioners was given irregularly to suit the convenience of the experts, such that examination in chief of each of them was taken before defence counsel had any opportunity to cross-examine:

Arrangements of this nature should never be allowed to prejudice, or give rise to the possibility of prejudice to the accused's case. (emphasis added)

In the circumstances of the case his Honour was left with an uncomfortable feeling that the way the evidence was led may well have disadvantaged the appellant's case in a significant manner.

36I also think it relevant to refer to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Cesan v The Queen (2008) 236 CLR 358. That case was more about the obligations of a trial judge than of a jury. In that case the capacity of the trial judge to offer the necessary superintendence and control of a jury trial was compromised by an undiagnosed medical condition. However, in the course of dealing with the appeal to the High Court, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ with whom Gummow and Heydon JJ agreed said at page 393 [119] to [120]:

[119] What is important, in these cases, is that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence. And it was upon the assessment of all of the evidence led at trial that the jury's verdict had to be founded. The repeated distraction of the jury from attending to the evidence at various stages of the trial, including when one of the accused was giving his evidence, constituted a miscarriage of justice. 

[120] Ensuring that the jury is not distracted from paying full attention to its task is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge. If trial counsel is concerned members of the jury cannot give, or are not giving, proper attention during the trial, it will be for counsel to raise that issue with the trail judge.

The significance of this passage in the present matter is, of course, to emphasize the importance of the jury paying attention to all of the evidence. 

37The argument of Mr Waterstreet, as I understand it, is that through no fault of their own, the capacity of the jury to pay attention fully to all of the evidence adduced in this trial was interfered with by their inability to see the CCTV footage clearly because of the distance in court.

38Although Mr Waterstreet did not rely upon it expressly, I think it important to refer to the matter of the slip made by me in relation to providing the CCTV footage and laptop to the jury at an earlier stage in the proceedings. It seems to me on reflection that this matter is not one which has been significant in the present circumstances. I have closely considered the matter, and I say this for these reasons. First, what is important according to what the plurality said in Cesan is the jury pay attention to all of the evidence. The jury should not be distracted from paying full attention to all of the evidence as it is given in court. The review of exhibits is, in my judgment, secondary to that consideration. Secondly, even in regard to access to exhibits, the practice in Australia has been that the jury is not given full and unsupervised access to the exhibits in the jury room until the jury has retired to deliberate and consider its verdict: R v H [1999] 2 Qd R 283 at [7] - [10]. This is so notwithstanding an evolving practice in New South Wales, as occurred in this case, of providing members of the jury with a folder at the outset and giving them copies of some relevant exhibits, mainly photographs, to enable them to follow the evidence as they go. 

39As I have said the test is one of necessity: is it necessary in the interests of Mr Ryan having a fair trial that the jury be discharged?

40Turning to some of the factors mentioned by the High Court in Crofts, I these make observations. There is no doubt, as I have said, that the evidence the subject of this application is important to the contested issues. When one considers the stage at which the mishap occurs one would have to say that the difficulty in seeing the CCTV footage clearly occurred some time ago for the first time, because some of it was shown to Mr Willis, a witness for the Crown, during the first week of the trial and the difficulty was only uncovered yesterday at the start of the fifth week of the trial. There is no deliberate conduct involved. It seems to me that the nature of the matter under consideration is unlikely to be overcome by a judicial direction. Although matters such as cost, convenience and the undesirability of a second trial are relevant to the exercise of my discretion, in my view they cannot trump, in any case, the prime consideration of ensuring that the trial is fair according to law. That does not mean, of course, that the trial be perfect or that in every respect the accused be accorded perfection on the scale of the available ideals of justice. 

41As I have said, what the jury have said about the matter is not determinative but to my mind it is highly relevant. One should assume always that jurors individually and the jury together are conscientious in the discharge of their heavy obligation. And it seems to me from my observations that this jury have been very attentive, ever assiduous in following the evidence, and have appeared to appreciate points made in evidence whilst it is being adduced. At least those are my impressions. Also when I consider the answers I received to the three questions that I asked I was impressed by the candour of each of the four jurors whom I questioned individually. Each of them adhered to the view that there was some difficulty in seeing the footage clearly in court. Three of the four said it was due to the distance in court and not due to the quality of the footage, which in the nature of these things is not great. I was equally impressed by the firmness with which they answered the third question, which I included in the list of questions at the request of the defence, that having seen the clear image on the laptop they did not feel that they were at any disadvantage in following the evidence as it was adduced. 

42I also feel it significant that when at the suggestion of Mr Waterstreet I asked that question of all the jurors none of them sought to give an answer or take the opportunity to give an answer which was in any way different from the answer given by the four jurors or who were questioned directly.

43It must be said that the quality of the footage is not great. The learned Crown Prosecutor in opening his case made a remark along those lines. Although I have the advantage of a personal monitor to view the footage when it is played, because of my obligations in relation to superintendence of the trial I have kept an eye on the jurors during the course of evidence, and I have also looked at the screen while the footage is playing to get an idea of what the witness being questioned - who is closer to me than the jurors - can see.

44Looking at the screens during the course of the trial has given me some idea of what the jury was likely to have seen as the evidence was adduced. The images are not clear. However, and in the way of evidence of this type, with the added assistance of carefully framed questions from counsel who is familiar with the material, I found that whether I was watching my personal monitor or watching the large screen on the wall, I could follow clearly what counsel was saying about what was depicted in the CCTV footage and, more importantly, follow the ideas he was developing during the course of his cross examination of the witnesses.

45It seems to me that the equipment in this courtroom is fairly modern. If I was not of the view that I have just expressed, I do not know what could be done to improve the image that the jury would receive in some other courtroom. Mr Waterstreet has said that in the Downing Centre there are courts that are better equipped than this one, and I have no doubt that may be correct. But in the type of exercise in attention required of a jury with regard to evidence of the type I have been discussing, it is essential for the jury's attention to be divided among the witness, the cross-examiner and the video screen, and I cannot think of any better configuration of screens than the configuration in this court to facilitate that process on the part of the jurors.

46In my opinion the matter raised by the jurors in MFI 30 has not prejudiced, even possibly, the defence in the manner described by Clarke JA in Rohatgi, nor has the criterion of the maintenance of the fairness of this trial been infringed by the substance of the matter the jury has raised. 

47For these reasons I refuse the application to discharge the jury.

		27 September 2012",2012-09-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760098,R v DC [2012] NSWSC 1125,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: The accused, DC, is a juvenile charged with one count of murder, one count of stealing from a dwelling and one count of take and drive a conveyance, each of which is the subject of an election for trial by judge alone.  This judgment deals with the verdict for those charges, and consequential orders.
Charges
2The accused was arraigned before the Supreme Court on 1 June 2012 on three counts, summarised above.  DC was charged, on indictment, that on 19 April 2011 at Suffolk Park in the State of New South Wales he did murder SDC; that on 19 April 2011 at Suffolk Park in the State of New South Wales he did steal $3,000 in Australian currency belonging to SDC in the dwelling house of SDC at (address withheld) Suffolk Park; and that on 19 April 2011 at Suffolk Park in the State of New South Wales he did without the consent of SDC, owner of a conveyance namely Holden Commodore Sedan bearing registration BI98CV, take and drive the said conveyance.
3The accused is a juvenile. As a result, his name and any matter that would identify him is, in accordance with the legislative provisions, unable to be disclosed.  As a consequence of that proposition, the identity of the alleged victim, who is the accused's mother, is the subject of a non-disclosure order and subject to the restrictions on disclosure imposed by the legislative regime:  see s 15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and in particular sub-section (5) thereof.
4As earlier stated the trial is conducted by judge alone.  An election under   s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was filed in Court on 21 August 2012.  It was signed by the accused and witnessed on 31 May 2012 and the Prosecutor consented on 1 June 2012.  21 August 2012 was prior to the day before the date fixed for hearing of the matter and the proceedings were heard as a judge alone trial.
Facts 
5The facts in this case are uncontroverted.  Evidence has been adduced by the filing of statements including the statements of police officers involved in the crime scene investigation at Suffolk Park, the statements of motel owners at Port Macquarie, the statements of police officers involved in the arrest of the accused and statements of a number of persons including neighbours and relatives associated with the behaviour of the accused and the disagreement between the accused and his mother on the night of 19 April 2011.  Further evidence has been adduced as to the medical history and background of the accused and current reports relating to his mental health. The following summary is taken largely from the Crown submissions. 
6The accused was 17 years of age at the time of the alleged offences and living with his mother, the deceased, at (address withheld) Suffolk Park.
7The accused has a history of mental illness with early onset/drug induced psychosis first diagnosed in March 2009.  At the time of the alleged offences, he was under the care of the Byron Bay Acute Care Team.
8The accused was sufficiently unwell to be involuntarily detained on 30 March 2011 in Richmond Clinic, attached to the Lismore Base Hospital.  He absconded on 1 April 2011 and returned home on 14 April 2011.  The deceased sought to have him re-scheduled but he was not visited before the killing and does not appear to have had any medication after 1 April 2011.
9The accused also has a history of violent conflict with his mother over the previous two years, which, according to the medical records, did not always coincide with his bouts of psychosis (see letter from Andreas Kirbach to Zain Constantine of 1 February 2011).
10On Sunday 17 April 2011, the deceased was at home with the accused when she went to her room to retrieve $3,000 in cash that she had set aside to pay bills.  She could not find the money and asked the accused if he had seen it.  He ignored her and walked away.
11At 9.59am on 18 April 2011, the deceased rang a family relative in a highly distressed state (see statement of Jameli Nader of 26 April 2011).  The deceased said that she had been awake all night as the accused had been coming in and out of the house with a knife and that, over the last couple of months, the accused had been walking around with a knife.
12In the afternoon of 18 April 2011, a nearby resident saw the accused holding a laptop on his shoulders listening to music in the street (statement of Paul Simke of 4 May 2011) and at about 11.00pm another neighbour observed the accused pacing up and down the street (statement of Joshua Carrick of 20 April 2011).
13At or about 4.00am on Tuesday 19 April 2011, the accused and the deceased had a loud verbal argument, which was overheard by neighbours.  The argument woke those neighbours from their sleep.  They heard the deceased screaming: 
""Stop!  Dave, you're killing me; you're going to kill me.  Stop, Dave!  You're killing me!"" (Statement of Remy Sedelaar of 20 April 2011) 
And, 
""Stop it!  Stop it!  You're going to kill me!"" (Statement of Joshua Carrick of 20 April 2011)
14Police were contacted by a concerned friend of the deceased and visited the residence on 20 April 2011 at about 8.00am.  They did not see the deceased when they made a cursory search of the house and it appeared to be in its usual state of untidiness (statements of Constable Gordon and Constable Keogh each dated 20 April 2011).
15At or about 10.30am on 20 April 2011, the aforesaid concerned friend gained entry to the house and found the deceased's body wrapped in carpet on the floor of a small toilet/shower area inside the garage.  The carpet was covered with a large number of towels all of which were heavily soiled with blood.
16Police returned to the house and a crime scene was established.  The police identified the body as SDC, the alleged victim in these charges.  There was a large quantity of blood on her arms and clothing.  She had black duct tape wrapped around her head and her mouth.  The bottom half of her body was covered by towels that had been bound to her body with white masking tape.  Her feet were in a purple plastic bag and this bag had been taped to her feet with white masking tape.  There appeared to be a number of stab wounds to the torso.
17The crime scene analysis revealed small amounts of blood in several rooms with a substantial amount being in the garage.  An area that had been cleaned was near the door of the car, if there were a car in the garage and it had been parked on its usual side.  The deceased's handbag and toiletry bag were nearby with some items scattered about the floor.  The deceased's vehicle was not in the garage and police sent out an alert for it and the accused.
18The vehicle was found abandoned on the south bound off ramp at the intersection of the Pacific Highway and the Oxley Highway at Port Macquarie.  It was later established that the accused had taken the vehicle and driven north to Brunswick Heads to purchase fuel before driving south.  After leaving the vehicle, the accused caught a taxi to Port Macquarie.  He had left a number of fifty-dollar notes scattered in the car and the keys were never found.  In his subsequent interview, the accused said that the police used remote control to stop the car.
19On 19 April 2011, the accused booked into a motel in the name of Jayden Murtorge of 7 Hayden Street, Suffolk Park, but told the employee that he was from Mudgee.  The next morning at about 9.00am he booked a second night.  At about 11.30am that morning (i.e. 20 April 2011), he booked into another motel in the name of Minsarrah Jarrette of 28 Henry Street, Parramatta for that same night.  He booked in for a second night the next morning. 
20At 5.35pm on 21 April 2011, police officers saw the accused and recognised him from the alert issued by Byron Bay police.  When asked his name, the accused said ""Jason"" or ""Jarrod"".  An officer then asked if he was DC and he said, ""No"".  He had no identification and told police he had $3,000 in his wallet.  He was then arrested and cautioned.  A detective then spoke to the accused who admitted being DC.  He denied killing his mother and asked what happened to her.  He was crying.  
21When asked where he had come from, the accused said:
""Sydney.  I have come here to buy drugs, that's all, honest.  I've been here for a few days to buy drugs.  Why would I kill my mother?  I've been in Sydney."" (Statement of Senior Constable Halverson of 21 April 2011)  
22When searched, DC was found to have $2,670, in cash, in his possession.
23When initially arrested, and when in the dock at the police station, the accused asked police several questions about how they knew things such as that he was in Port Macquarie and that his mother's body was in the bathroom.  When first processed at the police station, the accused was upset and when a police officer tried to settle him down, the accused replied:  
""But I killed my mother.""
24The accused, at that stage, put his hands over his face and appeared to cry and howl (statement of Senior Constable Gilmour of 22 April 2011).  In the dock, the accused said:  
""My mum said she gave a key to this junkie"" and ""I just came here to buy coke.""  
25The accused also said:  
""I was going to meet some big guy at Big W.  I was going to buy coke.  I was going to sell coke in Sydney."" (Statement of Senior Constable Sanger of 2 May 2011)
26The accused was given access to legal advice and was provided with a support person.  He agreed to be interviewed by police.  In the interview DC denied killing his mother.  He said he last saw his mother when she was shooting up with her friends, Mr Barnes and Ms Hodges. 
27DC said he took the money from the floor, after his mother had passed out from the drugs, and denied that she had asked him about the money.
28During the interview, the accused also denied having a verbal argument with his mother, but then said:  
""Well, you see, we had a fight and I made a spear and we had a big fight and I had this spear and I was just going up and I was just like, just leave me alone, let me do my own thing, or I'm gunna kill you.  So if she had been attacked she might have thought it was me, but I wouldn't have been, I, I wouldn't have hurt my mum, at, at all."" (ERISP, at A180)
The accused then said that the argument with his mother was two to four weeks before the interview.
29The accused explained to the police officers, during the course of the interview, that he makes spears in the back yard with metal and knives.   During the interview, the accused said:  
""... I'm not into like knives and stuff, I'm just into spears.  Like I'm not into killing people, I'm just into spears."" (ERISP, at A191)  
30Later he said:  
""I've got a car and my mum's dead so I think if I did it ... I would put her in the trunk... but I didn't do it and I have no idea about it..."" (ERISP, at A222 - A224)  
31He then informed the investigating officers that he did not want to answer any further questions.
Autopsy
32Professor Tim Lyons conducted the autopsy and observed a complex pattern of stab wounds to the torso and upper limbs.  There were 18 wounds, 22 skin nicks, three scratches and one abrasion.
33There were a number of sharp force injuries to both hands, typical of defence type injuries.  There was a complex pattern of multiple sharp force injuries to the left shoulder and left arm area.  They are consistent with a sustained assault, possibly involving the deceased using the left side of her body as a shield, and were, therefore, possibly also a form of defence injury.  There was an unusual pattern of sharp force injuries predominately on the right hand side of the back consisting of multiple small skin nicks probably inflicted from behind.  The chest and abdomen injuries were inflicted prior to death, but it was not possible to determine whether all injuries were inflicted ante mortem.
34Particular reference should be made to an incised wound in the upper left abdominal area with a depth of approximately 12 cm.  It ultimately transacted the posterior wall of the right ventricle.  This wound would over a few minutes have rapidly and inevitably led to death, even with immediate medical attention.  It was considered to have been inflicted by moderate to severe blunt force trauma.
35I find that the deceased died from the effect of the knife wounds inflicted by the accused.
Family background
36The deceased was a drug user and dealer in heroin, since at least 1981 (see criminal history of SDC). The accused's father was also a long term drug user and dealer in speed, heroin and cocaine.  His father's family and drug connections are in Sydney.
37Growing up, the accused lived in several foster homes, with his father when younger and finally with his mother.  The medical records note he had behavioural problems from a young age.
38In December 2008, the accused's father went missing after going to do a drug deal.  Police commenced an investigation at that time after finding the accused's father's car burnt out in a remote location.  During 2009, a number of people were arrested in relation to his disappearance, but it was not until 16 December 2009 that the body was found at the bottom of a cliff.  The body was identified by DNA.  One person has been convicted of the father's murder and a number of others with offences relating to his death.
39Witnesses observed that the accused's mental and psychological health deteriorated after the death of his father.
Detailed mental health history
40The accused was first diagnosed with onset psychosis/drug induced psychosis in March 2009.  He was arrested by police when running along a street with a carving knife.  He had delusions that a sniper was after him and told police he had smoked cannabis.
41On 21 June 2009, the accused was admitted to Lismore Hospital for six days.  He was fearful and believed people wanted to harm him.  He was admitted to Tweed Heads Hospital on 26 January 2010 for nine days.  On 27 February 2010, he was admitted to Lismore Hospital for 22 days.
42A community organisation assisting the accused had withdrawn support on 25 March 2011, because of his non-compliance with fortnightly Risperdal Consta injections and the increased risks to staff during home visits.  DC was verbally aggressive with staff.
43He was admitted to the Richmond Clinic on 30 March 2011 as an involuntary patient, because of a psychotic episode, after being taken to the Byron Bay Hospital the day prior.  He absconded from Richmond Clinic on 1 April 2011.  The Clinic informed the deceased on 1 April 2011 that the accused had absconded and, on 4 April 2011, the Clinic contacted the deceased, at which point she advised that the accused had not yet returned home.  A Missing Patient Form was also faxed to the Lismore Police informing them of the situation.  The form, completed by Dr Siefken, noted a past history of psychosis and described DC as displaying ""recent odd and aggressive behaviour"". Medical staff variously observed DC to be extremely perplexed, guarded, thought disordered and suspicious (see Lismore Mental Health Unit records). The police called the Clinic on 4 April 2011 to see if he had returned.
44Dr Siefken states that on 6 April 2011 he was advised that the accused was in contact with his mother and was to return to the Clinic.  This does not match other notes.  The discharge summary states that the accused had been given 50 milligrams of Rispenline on 11 April 2011, which appears to be an error.  The mental health worker contacted Lismore Mental Health Unit on 13 April 2011, and was advised that the accused had been ""discharged"", because he was ""wasting a bed"" and that his current location was unknown.
45On 14 April 2011, the deceased advised Mr Kirbach, the mental health worker, that the accused had returned home, was tired and his mobile phone had been switched off.
46Phone messages were left for the accused by the mental health worker and for the deceased on 18 and 19 April 2011, and on 19 April Mr Kirbach, together with a nurse, went to the deceased's home but found no one there.  Mr Kirbach made a statement for the police without the benefit of records and in it, stated that when the deceased told him that the accused had returned home, she also requested that Mr Kirbach come and assess the accused's mental health with a view to having him re-scheduled (statement of Mr Kirbach of 14 July 2011).  Mr Kirbach required an Acute Care Team member to accompany him and they were not available.  He said that the accused was on the list for the Acute Care Team to visit on the weekend of 16 and 17 April 2011 but for ""various reasons"" this did not happen: see statement of Mr Kirbach of 14 July 2011, at [22]. 
Psychiatric evidence
47On 10 June 2011, approximately one and a half months after the accused's arrest, Dr Bruce Westmore, examined the accused at the Adolescent Unit of the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay at the request of the accused's legal representatives.  The accused stated that he had smoked lots of weed and that he had heard:
""Voices to tell me to kill my mum so I killed her."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 14 June 2011)
He said that the voices told him that SDC was going to buy a gun and if he did not kill her, she would kill him.  Although he had heard voices before, these voices were different and he had heard them for a day.
48The accused said that he stopped taking his daily tablets of Seroquel about five days before the incident, as he did not think he needed them.  He stated that when he was in the car, after the incident, he took some medication and the voices went away.  When asked why he took the medication at that time, the accused said:  
""Because I knew I'd done something wrong, ah shit, look what I did."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 14 June 2011)  
While staying at the motel, the accused stopped taking the medication again.
49Dr Westmore observed that at the examination the accused was a little dishevelled and dirty, but otherwise pleasant and cooperative with reasonable eye contact maintained.  He spoke spontaneously and expansively but monotonously.  The accused's affect was flat and unresponsive and his mood was quite subdued.
50Dr Westmore provisionally diagnosed the accused as suffering from a chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness probably aggravated by past use of cannabis.  In June 2011, Dr Westmore concluded the accused was unfit to be tried at that time, but was of the opinion that he would likely become fit within twelve months.
51Dr Westmore examined the accused again on 9 December 2011.  When asked about the incident, the accused said:  
""I was high all week, all month.  I didn't get off the high.  I kept smoking every day.  Then I got voices that mum was a clone and that she was going to kill me.  I got scared and I killed her.  I just wanted to get out of the house as soon as possible."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 13 December 2011) 
52On this occasion, the accused said he had heard male voices internally and externally for a while and had stopped taking his medication about two months before the incident.  The accused said that he had pretended to swallow the tablets in front of his mental health worker, but spat them out later.  He also described smells and seeing things and said he was very paranoid.
53When asked if he had argued with his mother on the day of her death, the accused replied:  
""No, me and mum were on talking terms.  She was just scared.  I shouldn't have done it."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 13 December 2011) 
54The accused indicated he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and said: ""I've had schizophrenia for a long time and I kept smoking and it made it worse.  I used to get really bored and stuff."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 13 December 2011)
55The accused thought he had improved since being in hospital and said:  
""I think that this is the best place for me.  I know I've got a mental illness (but before) I kept refusing to accept that I had a mental illness.  I've been to groups and stuff (in hospital)."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 13 December 2011)
56Dr Westmore concluded that the accused was, as at December 2011, fit to stand trial. Dr Westmore's opinion, which I accept is that:  
""On the balance of probability, this man was suffering from an acute exacerbation of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia at the time he killed his mother.  Based on his history, his actions towards her were driven by paranoid delusional beliefs.  He suffers from a disease of the mind (chronic paranoid schizophrenia), which would have totally deprived him of the knowledge that he should not have acted as he did.  He would have available to him a mental illness defence to the charge of murder."" (Report of Dr Westmore of 13 December 2011) 
57At the request of the Crown, Professor David Greenberg, examined the accused on 11 and 15 April 2012 at the Bronte Unit at the Forensic Hospital.
58Professor Greenberg concluded that the accused suffers from:  
""A chronic schizophrenic disorder with mild negative features of schizophrenia including poverty of thought and ideation, blunted facial expressions (blunted affect - observed expression of emotion) and anhedonia.  He also has marked deterioration in his level of functioning over the past two or three years which can be attributed to his schizophrenic illness and history of chronic substance abuse."" (Report of Professor Greenberg of 3 May 2012)
59Professor Greenberg stated that the accused's account of what happened needed to be interpreted in the context of him suffering from his severe mental illness with the associated stated symptoms.
60The accused gave a more detailed account of events to Professor Greenberg.  I do not repeat them.
61Professor Greenberg observed in the examinations that the accused made good eye contact, spoke in a monotone voice, gave a limited account of himself and had marked poverty of thoughts.  He had blunted facial expressions and said he still had auditory and tactile hallucinations and visions.  He reported paranoid thoughts but not overt delusional beliefs.  He still feared people were trying to kill him but felt safe in hospital.  There were no grandiose or referential delusions.  He reported that aliens controlled his thoughts and they put thoughts in his brain such as ""Ha, Ha, I'm in your brain.""  He said that he has had special powers since the age of 15.  The accused displayed fair insight into his current illness and need for psychiatric treatment.
62Professor Greenberg is of the opinion that at the time of the alleged offences:
The accused was likely suffering from a disease of the mind, namely the symptoms of his acute schizophrenic disorder which were auditory hallucinations and paranoid/grandiose delusions;
The accused's non-compliance with medication, use of illicit substances and the inherent severity of his mental illness would have increased the instability of the mental illness and likely led to a deterioration in his schizophrenic mental state at the time of the alleged offence;
The accused had a defect of reason caused by a disease of the mind at the time of the offences but it is likely the accused knew the nature and quality of his actions;
The accused believed he was morally justified in his actions because he did not understand the moral wrongfulness of his actions as a result of his paranoid and grandiose delusions;
The accused clearly understood the legal wrongfulness of his actions, however, his thinking was disorganised and influenced by his disease of the mind at the time of the alleged offence;
On balance, it is likely the accused has a defence of mental illness; and
The accused is fit to stand trial.
Consideration and orders
63As is obvious from the foregoing, the accused was for some period unfit to stand trial and, on the basis of the expert evidence before the Court, I find that the accused is now fit for trial.
64As earlier stated, I accept the opinion of Dr Westmore, who examined the accused shortly after his incarceration and the events leading to the death of his mother and his arrest.  To a large degree Dr Westmore's opinion is confirmed by the opinion of Professor Greenberg.
65There is no doubt that the accused suffers from a disease of the mind, being chronic paranoid schizophrenia and I accept that at the time of the acts which led to the death of his mother, the accused would have been deprived, by that chronic paranoid schizophrenia and his disease of the mind, of the knowledge that he should not have acted as he did.
66While there are some fine differences between the manner in which Professor Greenberg has expressed his opinion and the views expressed by Dr Westmore, in my view, those views are predominately confirmatory.  To the extent that there is a difference of view, which I doubt, I prefer the view of Dr Westmore because of his greater history with the accused.  Nevertheless, as earlier stated, Professor Greenberg confirms the existence of the disease of the mind and the acute schizophrenic disorder and also diagnoses auditory hallucinations and paranoid and grandiose delusions.  While Professor Greenberg expresses the view that the accused would have understood the legal wrongfulness of his actions, he accepts that his thinking was disorganised and influenced by his disease and, that the accused believed he was morally justified in his actions because he did not understand the moral wrongfulness of his actions due to his mental illness.
67I accept the opinion of each of the experts that the accused has a disease of the mind being a disease capable of affecting the mind and having a mental origin.  That disease is permanent but capable of being treated by medication.
68The onus of proving a mental illness defence to the crimes charged lies on the accused on the balance of probabilities:  Mizzi v R (1960) 105 CLR 659.  I accept, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused did not understand that what he was doing was wrong: R v McNaghten (1843) 8 ER 718; R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 188 - 190.  The accused was, at the time of the acts, unable to think rationally.
69I am also satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, on the material and evidence before the Court, that, but for the possible defence of mental illness, the accused would be guilty of the offence of murder.
70Each of Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg opined that the accused had a defence of mental illness to the charge and, as is clear from the foregoing, I accept that opinion and independently come to the view, on the basis of the expert opinions and the history of this matter, that the accused has a defence of mental illness.
71One further comment should be made.  As is clear from the history that I have set forth in these reasons, the death of the deceased was an avoidable tragedy.  The deceased contacted the mental health teams in order to have the accused scheduled, and re-scheduled.  The accused's aunt contacted appropriate authority for the same purpose and to notify them of the strange behaviour of the accused.  The accused had ceased his medication, because he considered he no longer needed it.  A greater capacity to intervene at an earlier stage, or a greater preparedness so to do, would have obviated this tragedy.
72As a consequence of the foregoing the Court determines that there should be a finding of a special verdict, namely, that the accused, DC, is not guilty of each of the charges by reason of mental illness.
73As a consequence of that verdict the Court makes and enters the following orders:
(i)Pursuant to s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, a special verdict of not guilty of each charge by reason of mental illness; and
(ii)Pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, DC be detained in Austinmer Unit Forensic Hospital, Malabar, or such other facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law.

Judgment
Queanbeyan City Council Pollutes Queanbeyan River
1Following the decision of this Court in Environment Protection Authority v Queanbeyan City Council [2010] NSWLEC 237; (2010) 182 LGERA 36 (Queanbeyan No 1), Queanbeyan City Council (""the council"") pleaded guilty to an offence against s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (""the Act"") in that, from 6.00pm on 4 November 2007 to 7.00am on 5 November 2007, it polluted waters. 
2The pollution consisted of sewage entering and being placed in a position where it fell, descended or washed or being placed in a position where it was likely to fall, descend or wash, into the waters of the Queanbeyan River, and downstream thereof, due to a pump failure at the sewage pump station on Morisset St, Queanbeyan. 
3Section 120 of the Act creates the following offence:
120   Prohibition of pollution of waters
(1)  A person who pollutes any waters is guilty of an offence.
(2)  In this section: 
     pollute waters includes cause or permit any waters to be polluted.
4The council is now before the Court for sentencing. Having regard to the objective circumstances of the commission of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the council, in lieu of a fine, it is appropriate that an order be made that $80,000 be directed towards the fulfilment of an                                                environmental services order, together with an order that the council pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs as agreed by the parties and an order directing the council to publicise both its commission of the offence and the imposition of this sentence.
Uncontroversial Background Facts
5The facts in this matter were ultimately largely not in dispute and were contained in an extensive statement of agreed facts.
The Council's Sewage Treatment System
6The council operates a sewage treatment system serving all urban and rural-residential areas of the Queanbeyan Local Government Area. The system includes a sewage treatment plant located at Oaks Estate in the Australian Capital Territory, 15 pumping stations and over 326km of reticulation network. 
7Since November 2003, the management of the system has mainly been guided by a Strategic Business Plan for Sewerage adopted by the council.
8One of the sewage pumping stations serving Queanbeyan was located at Morisset St (""the Morisset St station"") near the Queanbeyan River. 
9Located in a park at Wanniassa St, 10m from the Queanbeyan River, was a retention structure that was connected to the Morisset St station. It was designed to retain sewage in the event of a pump failure in order to prevent a spill into the Queanbeyan River. The time needed to fill the retention structure varied depending on the amount, type and flow rate of sewage coming into the system and the influx of stormwater. 
Morisset Street Sewage Pumping Station
10The Morisset St station was constructed in the 1930s. At the date of the offence, the Morisset St station serviced a large proportion of the reticulation system, which had increased significantly as the population of Queanbeyan grew.
11Two pumps were installed at the Morisset St station as at the date of the offence, but only one could operate at a time, owing to the limitations in the capacity of the rising main and the available power supply. Further, the electrical infrastructure within the Morisset St station did not have the capacity to permit the installation of an automatic pump changeover system.
12Relevantly, on 4 November and 5 November 2007, only pump 1 was in operation.
13Each pump was able to move 300 litres of sewage per second against a 29.5m head. If a pump at the Morisset St station failed or was not in operation, there was a holding system to store untreated sewage in a well for a limited time (estimated to be 64 minutes of average dry weather flow (""ADWF"")) to allow the council's staff to be notified of the failure, to respond to the failure and to reset the pump. 
14The storage capacity of the station was estimated by the council to be 235m². If the storage capacity was exceeded untreated sewage would overflow from the retention structure in the Wanniassa St Park and could spill into the Queanbeyan River.
15The Morisset St station has subsequently been demolished and was replaced with a new pumping station in 2009. 
Upgrade of the Morisset Street Sewage Pumping Station
16In the mid 1990s, due to population growth, the council began to consider options for the upgrade or augmentation of the Morisset St station because excess capacity, particularly in times of wet weather, was becoming increasingly limited.
17The council initially engaged Fisher Stewart engineers to consider options for the augmentation of the capacity of the pumping station and, following receipt of their report in 1998, engaged Gutteridge Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd (""GHD"") to undertake the preliminary design work. GHD initially prepared an Options Study in relation to designing and constructing augmentation works to the Morisset St station to cater for expected growth up until 2012, to comply with Environment Protection Authority requirements and to increase the retention capacity from 64 minutes to the required four hours. 
18Based on the Options Study (specifically option 1B) GHD then prepared a comprehensive report, the Morisset Street Sewage Pumping Station Augmentation - Preliminary Sketch Plan Report (""the report""), dated February 2001. 
19The report set out the preliminary design of the proposed works and examined the issues and options involved in completing the works. Option 1B required: 
The retention of the existing SPS and pumps, construction of a new pump station/storage tank, upgraded electrical switchgear, provision of emergency power supply, replacement of the existing rising main, upgraded inlet works, improvements to safety facilities and other miscellaneous works.
20 A timeframe to complete construction during 2001 was put forward by GHD. 
21In the report GHD identified the following deficiencies at the Morisset St station: 
(a) the project had been initiated by a need to comply with the emergency storage requirement of four hours of ADWF at the sewage pumping station (""SPS""), as determined by the Environment Protection Authority (""the EPA"");
(b) the Morisset St station only provided for a wet well storage of 64 minutes at the current ADWF; and
(c) the pump controls and switchboard were located within the dry well on the first landing level some 3.3m below the roof level. This arrangement did not meet EPA requirements. In addition the following deficiencies existed:
the duty pump was selected manually which did not allow automatic division of operating hours between the pumps;
the main switchboard did not have any spare panel spaces for modification including provision of automatic pump changeover or parallel pump operation;
the float switches needed frequent maintenance due to a tendency to be ragged up; and
the telemetry alarm system did not differentiate between mains power failure and telemetry failure.
22The council did not implement the preliminary design prepared by GHD in the report. This was because it was determined in March 2004 that a further sewage treatment plant would need to be constructed to service the needs of the new subdivision catering for 15,000 residents at Googong.
23The council consulted with the then Department of Environment and Conservation (""DEC"") regarding the proposal to construct a replacement pumping station with significantly increased capacity. 
24Following this consultation, the council called for tenders for the preparation of a detailed design for the replacement of the Morisset St station. In February 2005, the council accepted the tender of Sinclair Knight Merz (""SKM"").
25In August 2005, SKM published a design report for the replacement of the Morisset St station and thereafter the council sought, by way of expressions of interest, tenders for the construction of the replacement Morisset St station. 
26In June 2006, a tender by Ledonne Constructions Pty Ltd (""Ledonne"") was accepted by the council. Ledonne expected completion of the construction of the Morisset St station by 28 May 2007. 
27By May 2007, the construction of the replacement Morisset St station was only 25% complete. The delay was a result of the inability of a subcontractor engaged by Ledonne to drill to a sufficient depth for the replacement station. These delays were exacerbated by the need to redesign aspects of the replacement Morisset St station. As a result of the delay, Ledonne breached its contract with the council and the council subsequently claimed liquidated damages against it. 
28A revised construction schedule was set with Ledonne for completion of the replacement pumping station by 15 December 2007. Relevantly, it was noted in the statement of agreed facts that if the council had terminated the contract with Ledonne, the date of completion of the replacement station would have extended well into 2008.
29The offence the subject of these proceedings occurred during the additional period provided to Ledonne for construction of the replacement Morisset St station.
30The replacement Morisset St station was not in fact completed until January 2009, due to further delays by Ledonne. The replacement station cost $6.8 million, taking into account the liquidated damages claim. 
31Relevantly, the replacement station has four submersible pumps, which are configured to commence operating in stages, dependent on the level of effluent in the wet well, with two duty pumps operating simultaneously and the other two pumps on stand-by. 
32Each pump has an operating capacity of 460 litres per second against a 31.5m head.
33If a fault is detected in the duty pair of pumps, the duty pair of pumps are stopped automatically and the stand-by pair takes over. Further, if a pump fails and/or effluent reaches a high water level in the wet well, an alarm is activated, which is sent by a new telemetry system to the council's control centre. In the event of a power failure, within 30 seconds two generators automatically start to provide sufficient power for two pumps to operate. 
34The replacement Morisset St station has a capacity to store four hours of ADWF.  
The First Prevention Notice
35On 3 December 2003 and 9 April 2004, there were discharges of untreated sewage from the Morisset St station at various points within the Riverside Caravan Park (""the Caravan Park"") on Morisset St. The sewage flooded areas of the Caravan Park that were occupied by, or immediately accessible to, the residents of the caravan park. The sewage also entered the stormwater system and flowed into the Queanbeyan River. 
36Accordingly, on 28 May 2004, the EPA issued the council with a prevention notice pursuant to s 96 of the Act (""the first prevention notice"") directing it to prepare a report documenting the history of the sewage overflows at the Caravan Park from December 2003 to April 2004; to assess the sewerage reticulation system in the area including the Morisset St station; and to develop an incident notification protocol. The report was to be submitted to the EPA by 6 August 2004.
37On 27 June 2004, there was a further spill of up to 100 litres of sewage into the Caravan Park caused by a collapsed pipe that blocked the reticulation system.
38On 12 and 21 July 2004, Mr Stephen Howard, on behalf of the council, responded to the first prevention notice noting that the cause of the spills was several screen trees planted within the Morisset St station; that the council had commissioned numerous consultant reports on the station; and that the augmentation of the station had been programmed for that financial year. Further, he stated that the telemetry system provided the council with a warning of 30 minutes before an event occurred and attached the council's Sewer Overflow Notification Procedure, which required immediate notification to the Department of Health and the EPA if the overflow was in ""close proximity, drainage or tributaries to a waterway where there is a high recreational use example is the Queanbeyan River between the months of November 1 each year and until the end of February each year inclusive"".
The Provision of Information and/or Records Notice 
39On 4 August 2005, the council notified DEC that there was another overflow incident at the Caravan Park caused by a failure at the Morisset St station. The spill caused 11,000 litres of untreated sewage to spill from the system into the Queanbeyan River. The two spill points were a manhole within the Caravan Park and the corner of Atkinson St and Wanniassa St.
40The council was served with a notice to provide information and/or records by DEC dated 18 August 2005 (""the information notice"").
41On 9 September 2005, the council responded by letter to the information notice. The letter noted that the sewage spill within the Caravan Park was caused by the failure of a 300mm diameter rising main within the Morisset St station, which was an unexpected occurrence that could not be identified through visual inspection; that since the incident the council had conducted a risk assessment of the station infrastructure and would purchase a third pump, which would be held at the station to be used if either pump failed; and that the council was investigating the option of relocating discharge points to less significant areas.   
The Second Prevention Notice
42On 15 February 2006, there was an additional overflow incident at the Caravan Park with the overflow entering the Queanbeyan River. 
43A letter to DEC from Mr Howard at the council dated 22 February 2006 referred to the council's intention to resolve ""issues with the Morisset Street Pump Station retention times"" by the augmentation of the pump station.
44On 28 February 2006, after the discharge on 15 February 2006, DEC issued another prevention notice, which was varied on 1 March 2006 (""the second prevention notice"").  A letter attached to the second prevention notice signed by Mr David Bell on behalf of DEC, stated that ""the DEC is aware that Council is committed to addressing the inadequacy of the sewerage system at the Morisset Street Pump Station. However, progress towards re-establishing adequate capacity in the system has been limited and too slow."" Relevantly, the prevention notice required the council to:
(a) investigate and identify ""the most appropriate surcharge location"".  That is to say, the most appropriate location for an overflow structure; 
(b)  produce and provide to the EPA a Surcharge Investigation Report identifying the ""most appropriate surcharge location"" and provide ""a schedule of works to implement the preferred surcharge location as identified""; 
(c)  report to the EPA on the actions taken to address sewage connection in the Caravan Park; and
(d)  prepare a capacity augmentation plan for the Morisset St station and associated infrastructure.
45The council responded to the second prevention notice in a letter by Mr Howard dated 21 April 2006. In that letter the council identified a location between Morisset St and Wanniassa St as the most appropriate surcharge location for an underground retention system that was to:
...have a capacity of 24.8 /m3 or 24800 litres and [be] constructed of four 1800mm diameter concrete pipes laid horizontally in the ground with a 450mm concrete diameter pipe surcharging into a [sic] earth bund.
46The letter also detailed the steps that the council intended to implement in order to augment the Morisset St station capacity.
47Mr Howard took into account the following safeguards:
(a)  sewer pumping stations containing two pumps usually have a pump controller integrated with the electrical switchboard; 
(b)  if the pumping station failed, an alarm would sound on the telemetry system and sewage would be stored in the pipes while the council responded to the alarm and restarted the pump;
(c)  a telemetry system installed by Rad-Tel Systems Pty Limited (""Rad-Tel"") with a backup battery, would allow an alert to be issued by text message at any hour of the day or night; 
(d)  when a sewer filled near capacity or when the power went out, an alarm immediately went to the Rad-Tel system, which sent a text message to the on-call supervisor; 
(e)  the telemetry system was a double redundancy system having two dedicated computers located at separate offices of the council that were linked by radio telemetry, mirroring each other. In addition, laptops were kept permanently at the homes of the council's Manager of Engineering Operations and Water and Sewer Supervisor, which provided the capability to monitor and operate systems remotely; and
(f)  if the telemetry system failed the council staff would be directed to monitor the pumping stations on an hourly basis until the telemetry system was again operative or by manning the depot outside of business hours. 
48As a result of the discharges, the council, in consultation with the EPA, designed and installed additional storage capacity in the reticulation system and a controlled discharge point at Wanniassa St Park. The installation of the additional storage was a temporary solution pending the replacement of the Morisset St station.
The Telemetry System 
49At the date of the offence, the Morisset St station was monitored by the council's telemetry system supplied by Rad-Tel. Rad-Tel installed the original telemetry system in the early 1990s and, while components of this system had been upgraded, many components were still original as at the date of the offence.
50The system at Morisset St station was designed so that if the pumps failed, the level of water within the station would rise, triggering inbuilt alarms.  
51The telemetry system is an alarm system that initiates an alert by radio signal to the council computer located at the station. This alert flashes on the council's computer system and triggers an audible alarm until the problem is resolved.  If the operator does not clear the alarm, the computer sends an SMS text message to a mobile telephone nominated by the council.  
52The audible alarm at the council's depot at Ellerton Dr had been disabled at the request of the council as at the date of the offence due to the annoyance it caused the council's employees. 
53The council was supplied with two laptops by Rad-Tel for remote access to the telemetry system. These laptops enabled the council to remotely dial in and monitor the pumps at the Morisset St station. The council's staff were trained in the operation and configuration of the dialler call out system and the use of the laptops during workshops conducted by Rad-Tel. One laptop was designated to Mr Darren Laws and the other to Mr Howard (who, as at the date of the offence, was no longer employed by the council and whose laptop could not be located).
54The Morisset St station telemetry system log files recorded when the pumps were working and also whether there was a Pump Failure Alarm, a Power Fail Alarm or a High Water Alarm. The word ""ACTIVE"" in the Morisset St station log file indicated that an alarm had been activated. 
The Overflow Incident on November 2007 Not the Subject of the Charge
55On Sunday, 4 November 2007, at approximately 5.54am (Australian Eastern Standard Time, or ""AEST"") or 6.54am (Daylight Savings Time, or ""DST""), Morisset St station pump no 1 failed. A Pump Fail Alarm was activated, however, the telemetry system SMS failed to engage and no text message was sent to the council's on-call supervisor's mobile phone. 
56On 4 November 2007 at 12:30pm, Mr John Pearson, the on-call supervisor, received a telephone call from a member of the public notifying him that sewage was flowing from a council manhole into the Queanbeyan River. 
57The council's on-call plumber, Mr James Howard, and labourer, Mr Doug Daniels, were notified of the discharge and attended the scene between 1.00-1.30pm DST in order to reset pump no 1. 
58The Morisset St station pump was reset according to the pump records at 1.08.58pm DST.
59The Morisset St station telemetry system log files on 4 November and 5 November 2007 recorded no Power Fail Alarms.
60The pump records for the overflow incident on the morning of 4 November 2007 indicated the following:
(1)  6.54.05 (am) Pump No 1 FAIL alarm ACTIVE
(2)  6.54.08 (am) The Morisset Street SPS Pump 1 OFF
(3)  8.47.17 (am) High Water Alarm for Pump 1 ACTIVE until  3.08
(4)  13.08.42 (pm) to 13.08.48 (pm) High Water Alarm for  Pump 1 NORMAL briefly
(5)  13.08.48 (pm) High Water Alarm for Pump 1 ACTIVE
(6)  13.08.52 (pm) Pump 1 FAIL Alarm NORMAL 
(7)  13.41.47 (pm) High Water Alarm for Pump 1 NORMAL
61Mr Pearson went to the council depot in order to investigate the problem with the telemetry system. Mr Evan Scott, an employee of Rad-Tel, suspected a faulty modem and, at 5.54pm, advised Mr Pearson to reboot the computer in order to free up the modem and test the SMS alert system. This did not resolve the problem.
62Mr Pearson notified Mr Steven Wells, the council's Special Projects Officer, that although the alarm had been activated, no SMS text alert had been received. Mr Wells attended the depot on 4 November 2007 but similarly could not rectify the problem with the telemetry system. Mr Wells spoke to Mr Scott at 7.00pm for 18 minutes when Mr Wells was in front of the computer at the depot and Mr Scott talked him through rebooting the computer.
63Mr Pearson left the depot knowing that the problem with the SMS notification had not been fixed. Mr Pearson was not trained to remotely dial in and monitor the pump at the Morisset St station using the laptops and no arrangements were made with those in possession of the laptops to remotely dial in and monitor the pump. However, the telemetry system was operational when Mr Pearson left the depot.
64The problem with the telemetry system could be neither identified nor rectified. Similarly, the reason for the failure of pump no 1 could not be identified.
65Mr Pearson did not call his supervisor, Mr Bill Webb, to advise him of the malfunctioning telemetry system over the weekend of 4 and 5 November 2007.
The Overflow Incident the Subject of the Charge
66On the evening of 4 November 2007, Morisset St station pump no 1 failed again. The High Water Alarm was activated but again the telemetry system did not activate and no text message was sent to the on-call supervisor.
67The pump records revealed as follows: 
4 November 2007
(1)  19.36.18 (pm) Pump 1 FAIL alarm ACTIVE
(2)  21.28.36 (pm) High Water Alarm ACTIVE
5 November 2007
(1)  6.47.53 (am) Pump 1 FAIL alarm NORMAL
(2)  6.48.03 (am) Pump 1 ON
68At 6.15am on 5 November 2007, Mr Christopher Pritzler was driving across the bridge over the Queanbeyan River when he noticed liquid discharging from a grill on the corner of Morisset St and Wanniassa St. Mr Pritzler observed that the council berm had, in part, been washed away. He took photographs of the discharge.
69It was not until 6.45am on Monday, 5 November 2007, when Mr Darren Laws, the council's Water and Sewer Supervisor, arrived at the council depot for work that Mr Laws noticed that an alarm had been activated for the Morisset St station. Mr Laws reactivated the pump at approximately 6.48am. By this time the failure of pump no 1 had gone undetected for 11.2 hours.
70At 7.10am Mr Laws attended the Wanniassa St Park where the Morisset St station is located and observed that:
(a) the ground around the overflow outlet was wet and that there was a slight trickle of untreated sewage still flowing towards the Queanbeyan River;
(b) part of the council's ""constructed berm"" located between the Wanniassa St overflow outlet and the Queanbeyan River had washed away;
(c) there was a clear track where the untreated sewage had recently flowed into the reeds located on the edge of the Queanbeyan River; and
(d) there were solids, paper and other sewage debris on the wet ground between the overflow outlet and the Queanbeyan River.
71Mr Laws contacted Mr Pearson and advised him that the Morisset St station had overflowed; that he had reset the pump; that he would need help to clean up the sewage; and that the EPA would need to be notified because it was not a minor spill.
72Mr Lance Gleeson, a backhoe operator, and Mr Michael Vlazlovski, a council truck driver, attended the Wanniassa St Park overflow outlet in order to commence the clean up process, which involved mechanically pumping the sewage out the grate to the holding chamber, raking the area to remove the top 100mm of soil, repairing the berm and spreading fresh soil. The area between the overflow outlet and the Queanbeyan River was also disinfected. 
73Mr Laws supervised the clean up process. He reported to Mr Pearson that it was completed by approximately noon on 5 November 2007.
74The overflow incident the subject of charge caused sewage to discharge from the overflow outlet into the Queanbeyan River from about 10:43pm on 4 November 2007 until about 6.48am on 5 November 2007. The duration of the flow was 8 hours, 4 minutes and 25 seconds. The sewage flowed into the Queanbeyan River to the Molonglo River and to Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. 
75On 5 November 2007, Mr Pearson sent an email to Mr Webb, Mr Steven Wells and Mr Laws reporting that a pollution incident had occurred on 4 November 2007; that he had investigated the problem at the council depot and saw that several alarms had come through the system but had not transferred to the on-call phone; that he had contacted Mr Wells on 4 November 2007 and advised him of the problem; that Mr Wells attended the depot and that the telemetry system was unable to be rectified that night, with the result that there was a second pump failure ""this morning with the same consequence."" 
76Later that day, Mr Webb had a conversation with Mr Nigel Sargent, the Regional Manager of DEC, to the following effect: 
Webb:  My name is Bill Webb from Queanbeyan City Council. I am ringing to notify you of a sewer overflow from a manhole in Waniassa Street this morning. We've had crews down there this morning and cleaned it up.
Sargent:  Do you know how much sewage overflowed and if it made it to the river.
Webb:  I do not know much sewage discharged from the manhole or how much of it made it to the Queanbeyan River, but I do not think it was very much.
Sargent:  Do you know what caused the overflow.
Webb:  We are looking into the cause of the overflow, but we think a pump may have failed. 
Sargent:  Can you please carry out an investigation into the overflow and report back to me.
Webb:  Yes, we will continue to investigate the cause and I will get back to you.
77Following this conversation, on 7 November 2007, Mr Webb emailed a report on the overflow to Mr Sargent. 
78The report stated that it was estimated that the discharge commenced at 10.30am Sunday morning and was later reported by a member of the public. It went on to state that the duty supervisor responded immediately and the pumps were reset at 1.33pm Sunday. 
79The volume of sewage that overflowed into the Queanbeyan River and travelled downstream was estimated to be between 915,336 and 1,112,830 litres. 
80The length of the Queanbeyan River from the point of discharge to the New South Wales /Australian Capital Territory border is 1.228km. The Queanbeyan River then continues beyond the New South Wales /Australian Capital Territory border until it meets the Molonglo River. The Molonglo River flows into Lake Burley Griffin. 
81On 8 November 2007, the east basin of Lake Burley Griffin and the Molonglo waterskiing area were closed. Members of the Lake User Group were notified of the pollution. These included various rowing and yacht clubs, boat hire and lake cruise businesses.
82On 9 November 2007, the whole of Lake Burley Griffin was closed until 16 November 2007. The waterskiing area, however, reopened on 13 November 2007.
83The council had a Sewer Overflow Notification Procedure that required notification to both the EPA and the Department of Health, but the council failed to notify the Department of Health of the sewage overflow the subject of the charge. 
84On 29 July 2008, the EPA served the council with a notice under s 203 of the Act to nominate a corporate representative for the purpose of answering questions. The council nominated Mr Gregory Fogarty, the Director of Engineering and Recreation Services.  
85On 22 August 2008, Mr Fogarty admitted in a general record of interview that over 4 November and 5 November 2007 there was a second pump failure of pump no 1 for over 11 hours, but stated that there was no overflow as a result. In addition, Mr Fogarty stated the following when questioned about whether, if a problem had been identified, it was part of the supervisor's role to implement additional measures to monitor the sewage pumping station: 
for something like this, that - after investigation, it became outside their control, there was [sic] other people that was [sic] more technically involved than them, that they didn't understand, that they would then go, ""okay, well, the problem's been fixed at the moment, it should be right"", ""we'll have to fix it tomorrow"" - that would have been their attitude.
Evidence of the EPA
86The EPA relied on additional evidence contained in the affidavits of: 
(a)  Mr Graham Nisbet, sworn 8 September 2011;
(b)  Ms Janice Taylor, sworn 31 October 2008; and
(c)  Ms Lyndal Walters, sworn 31 October 2008; 
87Mr Nisbet, a technical director of Rad-Tel, relevantly deposed to the fact that at approximately 1.00pm on 5 November 2007 he discovered that the problem with the telemetry system was caused by Telstra the week before changing the protocol for telemetry computers sending an SMS but that Telstra had not advised Rad-Tel of the change. 
88At 2.00pm the same day, Mr Nisbet dialled into the council's system and successfully installed the updated paging software. 
89Ms Janice Taylor, an investigator with the specialist investigations unit of the then Department of Environment and Climate Change (""DECC""), deposed that she conducted interviews with the following council employees: Mr Howard, Mr Wells, Mr Webb, Mr Fogarty and Mr Pearson. The records of interview were attached as exhibits to the affidavit of Ms Taylor. 
90During the interview of Mr Webb on 22 August 2008, the following exchange took place (Mr Phillip Herald is Mr Webb's solicitor):
Q393  So where here you've written, ""No spill occurred"", is that based on what you were told by others?
A.  Yes. If I could wind time back and go have a look at it at 6 o'clock - sorry.
Q394  So based on - -
Mr Herrald: The answer to the question, I think, is possibly.
Q395  It's possible that there was a second spill, a second overflow caused on 5 November?
A.  Which is possible, but the report to me was that it wasn't.
Q396  And who told you there wasn't an over - a spill, an overflow at the site?
A. I can't remember in detail exactly who said it. Someone must have told me, otherwise I wouldn't have written it down, ... 
91On the same day Ms Taylor conducted an interview with Mr Fogarty during which the following exchange took place: 
Q350  I guess I ask the question because as I look through the rest of the document - say, for example, 5 November 2007, the same day, later in that day, when we first have the pump fail on the 4th at18.36, if we look at a similar time 18.33, we have pump number 1 off, and then at 18.44 it's clipped on, and 18.46 it's clipped off, 18.56 it's clipped on, and it continues. 
 If we go to 6 November 2007, at 6am or thereabouts, we have multiple entries of pump number 1 coming on and off. Yet, if I look at page 3, I know there's 12 hours there where the pump hasn't been working, whereas if I compare it to another day on this print-out, the pump is on and off, on and off, draining out the sewerage quite regularly. 
 So my question is: is it possible then that by the pump being disable for 12 hours, is it a possibility that perhaps there was a second spill as a result of it reaching capacity and overflowing?
A.   No, there wasn't a second spill.
Q351   There wasn't a second spill?
A.   There wasn't a second spill. All the advice I've been   given was that there wasn't a second spill. The    advice was that the pumps did fail, the flow was    contained within the sewerage network. You have    to understand that besides having a level here, and   when I drew you that previous diagram - - 
92Ms Walters, a Regional Operations Officer of DECC, relevantly deposed that she inspected the site on 8 November 2007, during which time she took samples from the Queanbeyan River and took photographs of the Morisset St station and the site of the overflow. These photographs along with the photographs taken by Mr Pritzler were annexed to her affidavit. Also annexed were the pump records that confirmed that pump no 1 failed at 18.36.18 AEST on 4 November 2007 and was not reset until 5.48.03 AEST on 5 November 2007. 
Evidence of the Council
93The council relied on the evidence contained in three affidavits:
(a)  the affidavit of Ms Natasha Abbott sworn 11 October 2011; 
(b)  the affidavit of Mr Philip Hansen sworn 10 October 2011; and
(c)  the affidavit of Mr Doug Daniel sworn 30 September 2008.
94Mr Hansen, the council's Group Manager, deposed to the fact that the council had taken steps to improve staff support since the commission of the offence. He recognised that greater knowledge of the telemetry system by key staff and better provision of support for on-call supervisors when an issue arose out of hours may have prevented the discharge the subject of the charge. 
95Mr Hansen stated that the council had since created a new position of Technical Officer - Water and Sewer (""the technical officer""), who was required to have significant experience in the operational and technical aspects of managing sewerage infrastructure and a good working knowledge of telemetry systems. 
96In addition, on-call supervisors were retrained in relation to how to respond to alarms generated by the telemetry system. Further, on-call supervisors were provided with a list of senior staff upon whom they could call for guidance and assistance at any time, including overnight and on weekends. 
97Mr Hansen further stated that the council had taken steps to improve the monitoring and fail safe systems of the sewerage treatment system. Since the date of the offence, in addition to the significant improvement in the physical and operational capacity that the replacement Morisset St station has provided, the council had endeavoured to ensure that staff employed in the water and sewer section had greater technical expertise and were better informed of their responsibilities in the event of an incident occurring.
98The sewage treatment system continued to be monitored by the telemetry system, however, this had been significantly revised and updated. Mr Hansen noted that the telemetry system is now monitored by the technical officer. 
99In addition, the council's pump station maintenance team are based at the Morisset St station and are responsible for all pumping stations on the sewerage reticulation network. Mr Hansen deposed that, by being located on-site, the team is now able to deal immediately with any issues regarding the performance of the pump station. Moreover, the team is able to be called in on weekends and after business hours.
100The SMS paging module has also been upgraded so that four officers of the council are notified if an alarm goes off. A protocol built into the SMS paging module requires that an alarm SMS message must be acknowledged by at least one of the four recipients. If the SMS paging module does not receive the required acknowledgement, a voice-dialler module is programmed to call each of the designated mobile phones until a response is received. 
101Mr Hansen acknowledged that commission of the offence was due to the failure of the SMS paging module in the then Rad-Tel telemetry system. He stated that, in recognition of this failure, the new telemetry system was programmed to send a test SMS to each nominated mobile telephone at 9.00am each day. If the test SMS is not received, then those persons are trained to investigate the cause of the failure. Further, the telemetry system has an inbuilt polling system that tests the SMS paging module every hour and activates the voice-dialler module if there is a failure. 
102Mr Hansen stated that, in addition to the Pump Failure and High Water Alarms, two further alarms have been installed. The first is a High Flow Alarm with a trigger located on a trunk sewer line leading to the Morisset St station, and the second is a Run Time Alarm that is activated if the pumps run for longer than the designated period. 
103Mr Hansen also noted the fact that the council had since developed a Master Implementation Plan for a significant technological and capacity upgrade of the sewage treatment plant. In 2010, the council engaged Hunter Water Australia to undertake an upgrade options assessment, to be considered by the council. The planned upgrade was estimated to cost approximately $50 million. 
104The affidavit of Ms Abbott deposed to the management and use of the Queanbeyan River and to additional environmental projects undertaken by the council. Exhibited to Ms Abbott's affidavit was the Queanbeyan River Corridor Plan of Management, the Queanbeyan River Corridor Draft Plan of Management and Platypus Awareness and Conservation Strategy, and the Australian Platypus Conservancy Report to the council. 
105In 1996, the council commissioned a baseline environmental study of the Queanbeyan River Corridor, and in 1997, resolved to prepare a Plan of Management for the Queanbeyan River Corridor (""the Plan of Management""). This Plan of Management was adopted by the council in mid-1999. 
106The relevant goals of the Plan of Management included improving the water quality emanating from development and human activities to ensure compliance with guidelines for the protection of aquatic ecosystems and recreational waters, to achieve sustainable environmental flows and to maintain and improve the ecology and health of the river; and maintaining, protecting and enhancing the natural environmental values of the Queanbeyan River and improving the value and integrity of bushland and riparian zones. Other goals related to visual amenity and landscape; social and cultural heritage; recreation; education; and management. The Plan of Management set out the proposed actions to achieve these goals and their approximate costings. 
107The Plan of Management was to be implemented over a twenty year period ending in 2018, with the intention of fostering long-term strategies to address the many issues affecting the riverine catchment area rather than short-term ""bandaid solutions"". 
108Ms Abbott deposed that the Plan of Management was undergoing a review and a second draft of the revised plan would shortly be released for public exhibition and community consultation. The Queanbeyan River Corridor Draft Plan of Management (""the Draft Plan of Management"") provides a vision for the river corridor to be achieved by 2030, supported by actions to be implemented over the next decade. The high priority actions recommended in the Draft Plan of Management are as follows: 
(a)  increase riparian habitat and amenity of the river and its tributaries through pollution reduction, erosion control, stormwater treatment, rubbish removal, weed removal, regeneration and revegetation;
(b)  improve public access along the corridor by a network of sealed paths and unsealed tracks suitable for walkers and cyclists, allowing for circuits of variable length and condition;
(c)  strict planning and development controls to ensure future development does not adversely affect the river corridor;
(d)  improved coordination of rehabilitation activities within the corridor by government agencies and the community; and
(e)  increased community education and involvement.
109Activities listed in the Draft Plan of Management that have been recently undertaken to help rehabilitate the ecological value of the corridor include revegetation and weed control, aquatic plant control and restocking the river with native fish.
110In conjunction with the preparation of the Draft Plan of Management, Ms Abbott stated that the council had commissioned a Platypus Awareness and Conservation Strategy (""the PACS""). The first draft of the PACS had been received by the council from the Australian Platypus Conservancy. The three major elements of the PACS included: first, making provision for platypus in works protocols and management of public land; second, making provision for platypus in planning procedures and developing the role of platypus as a biodiversity ""flagship"" in community education; and third, investigating ecotourism opportunities. 
111Ms Abbott noted in relation to the downstream use of the Queanbeyan River, that the only recreational use by members of the public was occasional fishing from the banks of the river adjacent to the Morisset St bridge. However, this was not a regular occurrence.
112Further, Ms Abbott stated that members of the public did not swim or use this part of the river for recreational activities because it was difficult to access due to reeds and overgrown vegetation, was shallow and was dangerous to swim in due to the presence of willows. 
113A walking track is located on the western side of the river from the Weir Pool located in the Queanbeyan central business district and extending to the border of the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. Ms Abbott deposed that she was aware of regular walking groups and members of the public who utilised the track. 
114Upstream, the revised Plan of Management provides for more direct use of the river by members of the public. This use has increased since the implementation of the council's willow removal and revegetation program.
115Ms Abbott stated that, since the adoption of the Plan of Management, the council has had an ongoing commitment to the improvement of water quality and biodiversity in the Queanbeyan River. Particular projects supported by the council have included: 
(a)  the Olympic Landcare Planting Project, in conjunction with the Queanbeyan Landcare group in 2000, which involved willow and weed removal, river bank stabilisation, installation of a paved walkway along the river, tree planting and native landscaping downstream of the weir;
(b)  the creation of an ""outdoor classroom"" in Glebe Park;
(c)  the Buttles Creek Rehabilitation Program, in conjunction with the Queanbeyan Landcare group in 2003, which involved various river bank stabilisation measures, revegetation and establishment of native grasses downstream of the weir; 
(d)  the Barracks Flat Creek Rehabilitation Program, in conjunction with a group of conservation volunteers, undertaken in 2005 and 2006;
(e)  the Jumping Creek Erosion Remediation Project in 2010, which involved the remediation of erosion that had occurred on private land;
(f)  the Queanbeyan River Traditional Owners Restoration Project, which was initiated in 2008 and completed in March 2011. The objectives of the project included the restoration of the Queanbeyan River corridor, the increase in the involvement of Aboriginal people in natural resource management; and the increase of the awareness of the broader community of Aboriginal cultural heritage and resource management; 
(g)  the restocking of the river with native fish, with the assistance of the Queanbeyan Anglers Club; and
(h)  the regular cleanup of the Queanbeyan River, including the collection of litter and dumped refuse.
116Ms Abbott acknowledged that since the December 2010 floods in Queanbeyan, the council's resources have been devoted to the flood recovery effort and to re-establishing the river corridor downstream of the weir.
117Finally, Ms Abbott noted other environmental projects and groups supported by the council. These included: Queanbeyan Landcare; Fernleigh Park Landcare; the Waterwise project; the City of 10,000 Trees project; a waste reduction program; the Groundswell project; a ""3-bin"" domestic waste system; a wood smoke reduction program; a reduction of the environmental impact of the council's vehicle fleet; a program to manage the incident of noxious weeds; a household hazardous waste collection program; the South East Resource Recovery Regional Organisation of Councils; a sustainability strategy complete with a sustainability action plan and a climate change action plan; and the Sustaining Our Towns program.
118Mr Daniel, a plumber formerly employed by the council, deposed to his participation in a recorded interview with Ms Janice Taylor and Mr Craig Jones of DECC. During the interview he stated:
Q139  Did John say to you, ""Look, Doug, can you come past every two hours just to make sure the pump's working?
A.  No he would have given that information to the plumbing supervisor on the next day, I would have thought. 
Q141  The next day.
A.  I am not saying that for certain, but that's --
Q141  No, that's fine. So when you left the site, you weren't given any instructions to come and check or ""Look, we've got a problem with the telemetry system can you routinely check it?"" --
A.  No, no.
Q142  - ""Can you do a drive-by to make sure that it is not overflowing?
A.  No.
Q143  So you weren't given any instructions to that effect --
A. No.
Q144  - to prevent - you know, to prevent a potential -- 
A. No.
Q146  Did he say he was going to?
A.  No, not to my - I can't recall him saying that. I think - I think what happened was that they were chasing up why the alarm did not come through. 
Q147  Yes. 
A.  You know, why it didn't come through to his phone. 
Q148  Yes, there was a few people doing some ringing around, as I understand it, council.
A.  Yes.
Expert Evidence as to Environmental Harm Caused by the Overflow
119The parties also relied on a joint expert report of Mr Geoffrey Coade, Dr Kaye Power and Dr Daniel Martens as to the extent of environmental harm caused by the sewage overflow. The report was admitted subject to the relevance of the material dealing with the environmental harm in the Australian Capital Territory, pending the resolution of an issue concerning the extraterritorial operation of the Act (discussed further below). 
120The report concluded that the impact of the release of oxygen-demanding matter into the Queanbeyan River and the Molonglo River Systems as a result of the commission of the offence, whilst incremental, was environmentally insignificant in terms of harm. Similarly, the release of nutrient nitrogen and nutrient phosphorus into the Queanbeyan River was insignificant in terms of environmental harm. However, the report noted that the persistence of the nutrient phosphorus in the receiving waters was likely to have been somewhat longer than that for the nutrient nitrogen.
121In relation to the impact of the offence in the Australian Capital Territory, where the Molonglo River enters Lake Burley Griffin, it was agreed by the experts that there would have been no measurable increase in public health risk.
122The report further noted that, while people may have accessed the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers at various locations, the area considered to present the highest risk from exposure to pathogens was the Molonglo waterskiing area in the ACT. This was due to the potential for ingestion and inhalation during ""primary contact recreation"". 
123However, whilst the spill plume did reach the waterskiing area, the increase over background risk for bacterial pathogens was considered to be negligible due to biological decay of the pathogens over the time required to reach the area. Nevertheless, there would have been an increased risk of exposure to viruses and protozoa. 
Sentencing Principles
124Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""CSPA"") sets out the purposes of imposing a sentence on an offender. The most relevant purposes are those contained in paragraphs (a), (b), (e), (f) and (g) of s 3A of the CSPA. 
125The correct method of sentencing is the instinctive synthesis method, where the judge identifies all the factors relevant to the sentence and weighs their significance in determining an appropriate sentence (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [35]-[39], [50]-[84] and [136]-[139]). 
126The sentence imposed by the Court for an offence must both reflect, and be proportionate to, the objective circumstances of the offence and the personal or subjective circumstances of the council (Veen v The Queen [1979] HCA 7; (1979) 143 CLR 458 at 490 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472).
127Section 21A of the CSPA identifies matters that the Court must take into account when determining an appropriate sentence, including factors in aggravation (s 21A(2)) and factors in mitigation (s 21A(3)). 
128Section 241(1) of the Act also sets out matters that the Court is to take into account when imposing a sentence for an offence under the Act. That section relevantly provides:
241 Matters to be considered in imposing penalty
(1) In imposing a penalty for an offence against this Act or the regulations, the court is to take into consideration the following (so far as they are relevant):(a) the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence,(b) the practical measures that may be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm,(c) the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence,(d) the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence,(e) whether, in committing the offence, the person was complying with orders from an employer or supervising employee.
129The Court must not take facts into account in a manner that is adverse to the council unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. But if there are circumstances that the Court proposes to take into account in favour of the council, it is enough that these circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities (R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]).
The Objective Circumstances of the Overflow
130A primary factor the Court must consider when determining an appropriate sentence is the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence.  
131In determining the objective gravity or seriousness of the offence, the circumstances of the offence to which the Court may have regard include (Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [163] and Plath v Rawson [2009] NSWLEC 178; (2009) 170 LGERA 253 at [48]): 
(a) the nature of the offence;
(b) the maximum penalty for the offence;
(c) the harm caused to the environment by the overflow of sewage into the Queanbeyan River;
(d) the council's state of mind in committing the offence; 
(e) the council's reasons for committing the offence;
(f) the foreseeability of the risk of harm to the environment;
(g) the practical measures available to the council to avoid harm to the environment; and
(h) the council's control over the causes of harm to the environment.
Nature of the Offence
132A fundamental consideration of relevance to environmental offences is the degree to which the offender's conduct would offend against the legislative objectives expressed in the statutory offence (Director-General, Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae [2009] NSWLEC 137; (2009) 168 LGERA 121 at [15]).
133As Preston J observed in the context of an offence against s 120 of the Act (Environment Protection Authority v Baiada Poultry Pty Limited [2008] NSWLEC 280; (2008) 163 LGERA 71 at [23]):
Pollution of waters is a result offence where the proscribed result directly undermines the object of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997.
134The offence of polluting waters by allowing sewage to flow into the Queanbeyan River is wholly incompatible with the objects of the Act set out in s 3 of the Act, particularly, ss 3(a) and (d), which relevantly provide: 
3   Objects of Act
The objects of this Act are as follows:
(a)  to protect, restore and enhance the quality of the environment in New South Wales, having regard to the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development,...
(d)  to reduce risks to human health and prevent the degradation of the environment by the use of mechanisms that promote the following:
(i)  pollution prevention and cleaner production,(ii)  the reduction to harmless levels of the discharge of substances likely to cause harm to the environment,...(iv)  the making of progressive environmental improvements, including the reduction of pollution at source,(v)  the monitoring and reporting of environmental quality on a regular basis,
Maximum Penalty
135At the time of the commission of the offence the maximum penalty for a breach of s 120(1) of the Act was $1,000,000 (s 123(a) of the Act). This high maximum penalty mirrors the seriousness with which Parliament views the offence, which in turn reflects the approbation of the community for the commission of the offence (Camilleri's Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 698). 
Extraterritorial Operation of the Act 
136The council submitted that the Act, properly construed, does not operate extraterritorially and therefore the Court is not able to take into account the harm to the environment beyond the New South Wales (""NSW"") border to the Australian Capital Territory (""ACT""), including the harm to the Molonglo River, the waterskiing area and Lake Burley Griffin. 
137The reasons were threefold. First, the council argued that the reference to ""waters"" in s 120 is to be read as ""waters of New South Wales"" by reason of s 12(1)(b) of the Interpretation Act 1987. Under s 12 of the Interpretation Act, in any NSW Act ""a reference to a locality, jurisdiction or other matter or thing is a reference to such a locality, jurisdiction or other matter or thing in and of New South Wales.""
138Second, the council noted that in the interpretation of a provision of an Act a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act should be preferred to a construction that would not do so (s 33 of the Interpretation Act). Thus the council submitted that when having regard to the objects of the Act, particularly the object in s 3(a), that states it is an object of the Act ""to protect, restore and enhance the quality of the environment in New South Wales, having regard to the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development"" (emphasis added) it was clear that Parliament only intended the Act to operate within NSW. Further, the other objects of the Act, such as s 3(d) ""to reduce risks to human health and prevent the degradation of the environment"", that were not expressly limited to NSW were, by operation of s 12 of the Interpretation Act, equally circumscribed. Therefore, s 3(d) of the Act must also be read as ""to reduce risks to human health and prevent the degradation of the environment"" in New South Wales.
139Finally, the council submitted that the legislature considered the need for the extraterritorial operation of the Act and confined it to the circumstances set out in s 109 of the Act (concerning environment protection notices) and s 170 of the Act (concerning pollution coming into the State from acts or omissions outside of the State). Section 170 of the Act, for example, provides as follows:
170 Extra-territoriality
 A person is guilty of a particular offence against this Act or  the regulations in respect of any act or omission done or  omitted by the person outside the State:
(a) if the act or omission causes any substance to come into the State, and(b) if the substance causes harm or is likely to cause harm to the environment of the State, and(c) if (apart from this section) the act or omission would have constituted that offence if it had been done or omitted within the State.
140There being no equivalent express extraterritorial extension contained in s 120, the council submitted that the offence did not have extraterritorial operation and the environmental harm occurring in the ACT has to be ignored in determining the appropriate sentence.
141The EPA submitted that s 120 is a 'results offence' and that the Court is, in conformity with the objects and beneficial purpose of the legislation as expressed in s 3, able to take into account the consequences of the overflow in NSW that occurred in the ACT. In other words, the consequent pollution of the offence does not stop at the border, and therefore, the Court is not to be artificially constrained from considering the environmental harm that occurred across the border in the ACT. The EPA referred to a series of cases in support of its submission that, because it is a 'results based' offence and because there is a sufficient territorial nexus between the overflow in NSW and the resultant harm in the ACT, the Court is able to take the harm in the ACT into account in determining an appropriate sentence. 
142The first of those cases was Ward v R (1980) 142 CLR 308 where the High Court held that where a shot was fired from Victoria and the victim died in NSW, a court in NSW nevertheless had jurisdiction to determine the matter. This was because it was accepted that in relation to the crime of murder, it was where the act took effect upon its victim, in that case NSW, that determined jurisdiction. 

143The EPA also relied on the case of Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78, which concerned an appeal in relation to s 16 of the Clean Waters Act 1970, a provision that was in relevantly similar terms to those of s 120 of the Act. In Brownlie, there was a discharge into the Barwon River on the Queensland side of the border that travelled across the river to NSW. The Court held that the fact that the pollutant was discharged in Queensland did not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to hear the matter because the pollutant had reached the waters of NSW. 
144In Brownlie, there was discussion of the nature of the offence of polluting waters and the focus of the Clean Waters Act. Significantly, the Court stated that (at 83):
...the offences created by s 16 are ""result offences"". The occurrence, or likelihood of occurrence, of a certain consequence is a necessary element of the offence and is, indeed, the focal point of the legislature's concern with the conduct in question. The relevant consequence is the polluting of New South Wales waters. So far as the Clean Waters Act is concerned, for a farmer to spray his crops with pesticide is an entirely neutral activity unless it has, or is likely to have, a particular consequence for New South Wales waters.
145However, it must be acknowledged that in Brownlie it was common ground between the parties that the references to ""waters"" in the Clean Waters Act was to be understood as references to waters in NSW, as a result of the operation of s 12 of the Interpretation Act (at 81). The Court, therefore, proceeded on the basis that the offence only related to the pollution of the NSW side of the river.
146The decision of Lipohar v R [1999] HCA 65; (1999) 200 CLR 485 considered both Ward and Brownlie. In Lipohar, the High Court held that a South Australian court had jurisdiction to hear a conspiracy charge where the conspiracy was formed outside South Australia, but where the scheme was directed at a South Australian company operating in Victoria. Gleeson CJ began by considering the territorial theory of crime and the presumption that ""all crime is local"", concluding that (at [21]):
...the general common law requirement of single situs has never been absolute, and there is no reason, either in principle or in practical necessity, why it should be. 
147Gleeson CJ then looked at whether there was a sufficient connection between the conduct and the territory of South Australia for the offence to be punishable by South Australian law and concluded there was. 
148Of course it should be noted that in Lipohar the High Court was dealing with the common law offence of conspiracy, with punishment being prescribed by a South Australian statute. The findings of the Court were based, in part, on the fact that there is one unified common law in Australia that can be enforced where there is a sufficient territorial connection (Lipohar at [26]-[27]). 
149In my opinion, the Court has jurisdiction to determine sentence as a result of the fact that the initiating act and some of the resulting pollution occurred within NSW (Lipohar at [122]-[123]). As the EPA noted, the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine a criminal offence and the territorial ambit of a law that creates or defines the offence charged are two distinct questions (Thompson v R [1989] HCA 30; (1989) 169 CLR 1 at 19).
150There is no doubt, having regard to the objects of the Act and taking into consideration s 12 of the Interpretation Act, that the Act is concerned generally with the protection of the environment of NSW and that s 120 of the Act is specifically concerned with the protection against pollution of the waters of NSW. But although s 120 is plainly directed to the pollution of NSW waters, and not the waters of the ACT, the physical connection to the pollution that has occurred in the ACT as a result of the commission of the offence in NSW cannot sensibly be ignored and is sufficient to extend the reach of the Court's consideration, not of whether or not an offence was committed, but of the extent of the environmental harm that occurred by reason of the commission of the offence to other jurisdictions in determining the imposition of an appropriate sentence. 
151In my view there in nothing in the language of either ss 120 or 241 of the Act or s 21A of the CSPA that would preclude the Court from examining the totality of the harm caused by the commission of the offence, even if part of that harm occurs in another jurisdiction. On the contrary, such a conclusion is in conformity with the objects of the Act, especially the objects expressed in s 3(d) (in which no reference to ""New South Wales"" is made), and with s 170 of the Act, the purpose of which is plainly to extend, and not limit, the scope of criminal liability under the Act. 
152If the council, although operating in NSW, had only discharged sewage (say, due to a broken pipe) into ACT receiving waters, then it is likely that no offence would have been committed pursuant to s 120 of the Act because there had been no pollution of NSW waters.  But this is not what occurred in the present instance. Here waters of both NSW and the ACT were polluted as a consequence of the overflow.  While the council is not charged with an offence of polluting ACT waters, nevertheless when assessing the total adverse impact of the commission of the offence regard can, and in my opinion should, be had to the effect of the pollution on all of the receiving waters, including those in the ACT. The protection of Australia's unique environment ought not be thwarted by artificially constructed legal boundaries; polluting events do not cease to be polluting merely because they traverse jurisdictional lines. 
153I therefore find that the Act does operate extraterritorially insofar as it allows the Court to take into account the totality of the environmental harm caused by the commission of the offence in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the council.
The Extent of the Environmental Harm Caused by the Overflow
154The extent of harm caused or likely to be caused by the commission of the offence can increase the objective seriousness of the offence (s 241(1)(a) of the Act). 
155The phrase ""harm to the environment"" is broadly defined in the Dictionary to the Act to include:
any direct or indirect alteration of the environment that has the effect of degrading the environment and, without limiting the generality of the above, includes any act or omission that results in pollution.
156Harm to the environment need not only be considered in terms of actual harm, but must also include the potential or risk of harm. In Environment Protection Authority v Waste Recycling and Processing Corp [2006] NSWLEC 419; (2006) 148 LGERA 299 Preston J opined (at [145]-[147] and [149]):
145  Harmfulness needs to not only be considered in terms of actual harm, the potential or risk of harm should also be taken into account: Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357 at 366 and Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34 (6 February 2006) at [175]. Harm should not be limited to measurable harm such as actual harm to human health. It can also include a broader notion of the quality of life. 
146  Harm can include harm to the environment and its ecology. Harm to an animal or plant not only adversely affects that animal or plant, it also affects other biota that have ecological relationships to that animal or plant: Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34 (6 February 2006) at [174]. 
147  Harm can be direct or indirect, individual or cumulative. Activities that contribute incrementally to the gradual deterioration of the environment, even when they cause no discernable direct harm to human interest, should also be treated seriously.
...
149  The fact that the environment harmed by the offender's conduct was already disturbed or modified is not a mitigating factor: State Pollution Control Commission v White Wings Ltd. (unreported, Land & Environment Court, No 50129 of 1991, Bignold J, 1 November 1991) at p 4; Environment Protection Authority v Ecolab Pty Ltd (2002) 123 LGERA 269 at 273 [14]; Environment Protection Authority v Coggins (2003) 126 LGERA 219 at 224 [18]; Environment Protection Authority v Abigroup Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] NSWLEC 342 (15 December 2003) at [24]; Environment Protection Authority v Arenco Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 244 (9 May 2006) at [26].
157The term ""likely"" in s 241(1)(a) of the Act was defined in Newcastle City Council v Pace Farm Egg Products Pty Ltd [2002] NSWLEC 66 (at [44]) as follows: 
In considering the harm likely to be caused to the environment, it is to be noted that the word ""likely"" in this context has been held to mean ""a real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than a fifty per cent chance"" (Mathews v Goulburn Wool Processors NSWSC, Smart J, 6 November 1986, unreported); ""only a real chance or possibility, and not more probably than not"" (State Pollution Control Commission v Blayney Abattoirs Pty Ltd (1991) 72 LGERA 221 at 224); and ""does not mean 'probable'. It means 'a real possibility'"" (New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-operative Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission (1991) 73 LGRA 86 at 100, affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on other grounds, (1992) 75 LGRA 320).

158In some cases it is necessary for the Court to consider the state of the environment prior to the commission of the offence in order to assess the extent of the environmental harm caused by the offence and to avoid the offender being made responsible for the environmental harm inflicted by others (Environment Protection Authority v Ecolab Pty Limited [2002] NSWLEC 206; (2002) 123 LGERA 269 at [12]-[15] and Director-General, Department of Environment and Climate Change v Walker Corporation Pty Limited (No 4) [2011] NSWLEC 119 at [88]). 
159However, as the EPA submitted and as I accept, the fact that the Queanbeyan River had already been modified or disturbed by the first overflow on 4 November 2007 cannot be a factor mitigating the council's conduct (Ecolab at [14], Waste Recycling and Processing Corp at [149] and Walker Corporation (No 4) at [89]). 
160The offence involved the discharge of between 915,336 and 1,112,830 litres of sewage into the Queanbeyan and Molongolo River systems. 
161Notwithstanding this staggering amount of effluent, it was agreed, based on the joint experts statement, that the impact of the release of oxygen-demanding matter into the Queanbeyan River, whilst incremental, was insignificant in terms of environmental harm. Similarly, the release of nutrient nitrogen and nutrient phosphorus into the Queanbeyan River was insignificant in terms of environmental harm. However, the persistence of the nutrient phosphorus in the water was likely to have been somewhat longer than the nitrogen.
162In relation to the sewage that travelled downstream, across the NSW border and into the Molonglo River in the ACT, which flows into Lake Burley Griffin, this discharge was considered sufficiently serious to justify the closure of Lake Burley Griffin and the Molonglo waterskiing area. Although the pollution incident occurred on 4 November 2007, these areas were not closed until 8 and 9 November 2007.  They did not reopen until 13 and 16 November 2007.
163Similarly to the Queanbeyan River system, however, the impact of the release of oxygen-demanding matter, nutrient nitrogen and nutrient phosphorus into the Molonglo River system was insignificant in terms of environmental harm. The Molonglo waterskiing area was considered to present the highest risk from exposure to pathogens, due to the potential for ingestion and inhalation during ""primary contact recreation"". But while the spill plume reached the waterskiing area, the increase over background risk for bacterial pathogens was considered to be negligible due to biological decay of the pathogens over the period required to reach the waterskiing area.  It was noted in the joint expert statement, however, that there would have been an increased risk of exposure to viruses and protozoa.
164While the EPA accepted that the actual harm to the environment was not ""significant"" and that the offence did not involve a serious risk to public health, it submitted that there was a potential or likely risk to public health by the exposure of public areas to contamination by the overflow of a large quantity of sewage. 
165The council, on the other hand, submitted that there was no actual harm to the Queanbeyan River caused by the offence and that there was no potential for harm, given the evidence of Ms Abbott that the area of the Queanbeyan River downstream from the flow to the NSW border is not used for swimming and recreation and is only rarely used for fishing. The council accepted that there was minor actual harm to the Wanniassa St Park caused by the offence, although it submitted that the duration of the harm was limited in time because the discharge in the park was cleaned up by the council on the morning of 5 November 2007. 
166In having regard to the expert evidence before the Court, I find that any actual harm caused by the offence was, as the unchallenged expert evidence plainly demonstrated, ""insignificant"" in terms of its impact on the receiving waters. 
167Having said this, I nevertheless find beyond reasonable doubt that there was potential, albeit low, for harm to public health and the environment given the large amount of sewage discharged into the rivers and given that people use the rivers for fishing and recreational activities. 
State of Mind of the Council 
168A strict liability offence, such as the offence in question, that is committed recklessly will be objectively more serious than one not so committed (Rae at [42]). 
169The council submitted that it would be an error of law to sentence it for a more serious offence than that with which it has been charged (R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389). The submission arose in the following way. The council has pleaded guilty to a ""Tier 2"" offence against s 120 of the Act. The more serious ""Tier 1"" offence, with which the council has not been charged, is an offence against s 116 of the Act, which states:
116   Leaks, spillages and other escapes
(1)  If a person wilfully or negligently causes any substance to leak, spill or otherwise escape (whether or not from a container) in a manner that harms or is likely to harm the environment: 
(a)  the person, and(b)  if the person is not the owner of the substance, the owner,
      are each guilty of an offence.
170The rule against punishment for a higher offence than that which the defendant has been charged was set out in R v De Simoni (""the De Simoni principle"") per Gibbs CJ (at 389 and 392):
However, the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted. Section 582 reflects this principle. The combined effect of the two principles, so far as it is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence. 
At common law the principle that circumstances of aggravation not alleged in the indictment could not be relied upon for purposes of sentence if those circumstances could have been made the subject of a distinct charge appears to have been recognized as early as the eighteenth century
...
It is not only in cases in which the offence has been accompanied by circumstances of aggravation that a trial judge may be required, in sentencing, to take an artificially restricted view of the facts. This will be so also in cases where the jury's verdict is inconsistent with the view of the facts that the judge himself has formed, for the judge cannot act on a view of the facts which conflicts with the jury's verdict. However, where the Crown has charged the offender with, or has accepted a plea of guilty to, an offence less serious than the facts warrant, it cannot rely or ask the judge to rely, on the facts that would have rendered the offender liable to a more serious penalty. 

171Accordingly, a sentencing judge cannot take into account a factor which would constitute an element of a more serious offence than the one with which an offender has been charged and of which the offender has been convicted, or to which the offender has pleaded guilty (Cassidy v R [2012] NSWCCA 68 at [1]).
172An offence is more serious than another offence for the purposes of the De Simoni principle if it renders the offender liable to a heavier penalty than the offence for which the offender is being sentenced (Environment Protection Authority v Snowy Hydro Limited [2008] NSWLEC 264; (2008) 162 LGERA 273 at [147] citing R v Booth (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 September 1997, unreported), Environment Protection Authority v Tea Garden Farms Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 89 at [101] and Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage v Rinaldo (Nino) Lani [2012] NSWLEC 115 at [35]-[39]).
173The maximum penalty for an offence against s 116 of the Act in the case of a corporation is $5,000,000 for an offence that is committed wilfully, or $2,000,000 for an offence that is committed negligently, whilst the maximum penalty for an offence against s 120 is $1,000,000. The offence in s 116 is, therefore, a more serious offence than the offence to which the council has pleaded guilty and, in my opinion, satisfies the pre-condition for application of the De Simoni principle.
174The De Simoni principle has been applied in statutory contexts, including in the sentencing for environmental offences. In Snowy Hydro, Biscoe J considered the application of the De Simoni principle in the context of s 120 of the Act. His Honour stated that (at [148]-[149]): 
148  The principle has been applied in statutory contexts. For example, it was applied to the Criminal Code (WA) in De Simoni and to the Criminal Code (Tas) in Lovegrove v R [1961] Tas SR 206, which was approved in De Simoni at 390-391. In determining whether the De Simoni principle applies in a particular statutory context, the task is to interpret the language used and not to construe the statutory provisions on the assumption that they were intended to reproduce the common law. But if the meaning of the statutory provisions is doubtful, resort may be had to the common law for the purpose of aiding their construction: De Simoni at 391-392.
149  The question then is whether the De Simoni principle applies in the context of the POEO Act. There is appellate authority that it does. In Hardt v Environment Protection Authority (2007) 156 LGERA 337 at 348-349 [53] (NSWCCA) Giles JA (Grove and Harrison JJ agreeing) held in the context of a strict liability offence under the POEO Act, that:
Subject to R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 considerations, it is relevant to sentence for a strict liability offence or an offence with a mental element less than intention to commit the offence to consider with what intention and appreciation of the offence it was committed. Depending on the intention, the offence may be regarded as more serious.
175His Honour concluded in Snowy Hydro that the De Simoni principle precluded the Court from considering whether the conduct of the defendant was negligent because of the more serious offence under s 116 of the Act. His Honour reasoned that ([150]-[151]):
150  Section 241(1) of the POEO Act (set out at [135] above) does not list negligence among the matters that it mandates must be taken into consideration. However, findings adverse to an offender charged under s 120 in relation to matters listed in s 241(1) could lead the court in some circumstances to conclude that the conduct of an offender charged under s 120 was negligent. There is artificiality in the court then stopping short of describing the conduct as negligent, having regard to s 116 and the De Simoni principle. Nevertheless, it has come to be accepted that the application of the De Simoni principle means that an offender may be sentenced on the fictitious basis that a circumstance of aggravation does not exist when a trial judge would otherwise find that it did exist. In such a case, the price of the principle is an artificially restricted view of the facts. This was recognised in De Simoni at 389, 392. However, at a practical level, if matters listed in s 241(1) were to be decided adversely to an offender, in some circumstances the degree of aggravation may not be much greater if the offender's conduct was also described as negligent.
151  On the basis of the De Simoni principle, I do not propose to entertain the question whether the conduct of Snowy Hydro was negligent.
176Likewise, Craig J in Tea Garden Farms reasoned (at [101]- [102]):
101  The defendant submits that to punish the defendant on the basis that its actions were reckless would contravene the principles enunciated by the High Court in R v De Simoni [1991] HCA 31; (1991) 147 CLR 383. A finding of recklessness would be tantamount to finding an element of aggravation that would warrant conviction for a more serious offence, namely an offence against s 116 of the POEO Act. That approach would offend the dictum of Gibbs CJ (Mason and Murphy JJ agreeing) in De Simoni at 389.
102  I accept the submission of the defendant. While the provisions of s 116 of the POEO Act proscribe, in terms, conduct that ""wilfully or negligently causes any substance to leak, spill or otherwise escape"", it seems to me that ""recklessly"" causing a substance to escape is also conduct that is proscribed by the section. I would regard reckless conduct to involve a lower order of fault than ""wilful"" but to involve an equivalent, if not higher order of fault than ""negligent"" conduct. As conduct involving fault of the latter kind engages the provisions of s 116, it would make no sense to interpret the section as being inapplicable to conduct that was ""reckless""...

177A similar finding was made by Sheahan J in Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet v Powell [2012] NSWLEC 129 at [118] (citing Rae at [42]-[43]).  
178In this case, I accept that the operation of the De Simoni principle prevents me from considering whether the council acted wilfully or negligently in committing the offence in contravention of s 120 of the Act by reason of the more serious offence of wilfully or negligently causing any substance to leak, spill or otherwise escape contained in s 116 of the Act. 
179I further find, applying the reasoning in Tea Garden Farms, that the principle precludes me from considering whether or not the council acted recklessly in the commission of the offence, contrary to the submissions of the EPA, which submitted that the council was reckless to the prospect of there being another sewage overflow. 
180The term reckless describes the state of mind of an offender who, while performing or failing to perform an act, is aware of the risk that a particular consequence is likely, in the sense of probable or possible, to result from that act or omission (Pemble v R (1971) 124 CLR 107, La Fontaine v R (1976) 136 CLR 62 and R v Crabbe [1985] HCA 22; (1985) 156 CLR 464). In Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; (2011) 208 A Crim R 392, the Court of Criminal Appeal opined that in order to establish the mental element of recklessness ""the Crown must establish foresight of the possibility of the relevant consequence"" (at [76]). 
181But even if I am wrong in my conclusion that I cannot consider whether or not the council acted recklessly in the commission of the offence, I would not, in any event, find this mental element demonstrated to the requisite criminal standard on the available evidence. 
182Mr Pearson left the council depot without knowing that the problem with the telemetry system had not been identified. He believed it was still operational. Similarly, the reason for the failure of pump no 1 could not be identified, and the pump was reset when he left the depot. It was not until after the second discharge that Mr Pearson realised that the telemetry system and pump no 1 were still not working. In these circumstances, I could not find that the council was reckless at the time of the commission of the offence.  
183It is convenient at this juncture to deal with an allied submission put by the prosecutor concerning the council's state of mind as at the time of the commission of the offence. An offence that is committed without regard for public safety will be objectively more serious than one not so committed (s 21A(2)(i) of the CSPA). The EPA submitted that it was a factor in aggravation in relation to the commission of the offence that the council committed the offence without regard for public safety in that it was committed with the council possessing the knowledge that similar events had occurred before and in circumstances where the council failed to report that an overflow had occurred.
184I have discussed the applicable principles for finding that an offence was committed without regard for public safety in the context of an offence against s 128 of the Act in Environment Protection Authority v Unomedical Pty Limited (No 4) [2011] NSWLEC 131 (at [73]-[75]):
73  In what is now regarded as a seminal passage, in Elyard v  R [2006] NSWCCA 43; (2006) 45 MVR 402 Basten JA  opined that (at 12]):
12  It appears from the cases that the factor which has given rise to significant difficulty is para (i) dealing with offences committed ""without regard for public safety"". There has been limited consideration as to whether this factor involves an objective, or subjective test, and if subjective, what level of conscious or reckless disregard is required on the part of the offender. It may well be that this factor should be understood as encompassing both objective and subjective circumstances. However, the distinction can be helpful in order to avoid the danger of double-counting. Where the offence is of a kind which, objectively or abstractly, reflects a policy of prohibiting conduct which disregards public safety, it will be necessary, in order to engage the aggravating factor, to find some aspect of the specific conduct in question which goes beyond the objective element or underlying policy.
74  The reasoning in Elyard was recently endorsed in Mansour v R [2011] NSWCCA 28 by Price J (with whom James and Hall JJ agreed: at [2] and [3]) who stated that (at [46]):
46  It is well established that a factor should not be taken into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2), if it is either an element of the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an inherent characteristic of that kind of offence: see for example Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43; Ward v R [2007] NSWCCA 22; (2007) 168 A Crim R 545.  A factor, which is an inherent characteristic of the kind of offence for which the offender is being sentenced, cannot be taken into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2), unless its nature or extent in the particular case is unusual. As Simpson J observed in Regina v Yildiz [2006] NSWCCA 97; (2006) 160 A Crim R 218 at [37]: 
... But this principle does not mean that the degree to which the ""inherent characteristic"" exists in relation to a particular offence may not, where it exceeds the norm, be taken into account as an aggravating factor.
75  Thus if disregard for public safety is an inherent characteristic of the kind of offence for which the offender is being sentenced... it cannot be taken into account because s 21A(2)(i) of the CSPA is not engaged. 

185The underlying objective or policy reflected in the enactment of the offence of s 120 of the Act is to prohibit the pollution of waters, which, consistent with the objects of the Act (see s 3(d) of the Act), could result in harm to human health. However, this does not equate to a finding that an inherent characteristic of the offence in s 120 of the Act is acting without regard for public safety. There are many instances where in the polluting of waters, regard is had for public safety, albeit not for the environment. For example, where the substance causing the water pollution is harmless to humans but not to the environment. 
186The difficulty that the EPA faces is that it bears the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the council polluted waters without regard for public safety. I am not persuaded it has discharged that onus on the evidence before the Court.
187The cause of the offence was the dual failures of pump no 1 and the telemetry system so that no SMS was sent when the pump shut down and, as a result, the spill went undetected for a number of hours. Far from disregarding such a risk, the council had contemplated the possibility of a pump failure and had put measures in place to ensure that the pumps were monitored should such a problem arise, even if these measures proved to be inadequate at the time of the commission of the offence. Further, the council had acknowledged the inadequacy of the current Morisset St station given the growing population of Queanbeyan and had began the process of constructing a new pumping station.
188Therefore, while there was human error on the part of Mr Pearson, who failed to monitor the depot or the station after the initial failure of the pump, and there were additional practical measures available that could have been taken to prevent or mitigate the harm, as demonstrated by the subsequent procedures and processes implemented by the council, the evidence does not support a finding that the conduct of the council in breaching s 120 of the Act was in disregard of public safety.
Reasons for Committing the Offence
189A factor by which the objective seriousness of the offence may be augmented is the reason for its commission (Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357 at 366, Bentley at [237] and Rae at [47]). If the offence is found to be committed for financial gain this will increase its objective seriousness (Bentley at [246]-[247] and s 21A(2)(o) of the CSPA). 
190The prosector submitted that the offence was ""condoned"" by the council because of its failure to monitor the operations of the Morisset St station and that this should be taken into account as an aggravating factor in determining an appropriate sentence under s 21A(2)(o). I do not agree.
191I do not accept that a failure to monitor the Morisset St station by the council can amount to a conclusion that the offence was ""condoned"" by the council and committed for financial gain. There is no cogent evidence to support such a finding.
192The council submitted that, not only was it not carrying out a profit-making activity, but that it was carrying out an essential community service. The activity being carried out was the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage, which is an activity that is manifestly beneficial to the community and the environment. The council submitted that the community and environmental benefits of the activity should be a factor taken into account in mitigation. 
193In this regard the council relied on the case of Environment Protection Authority v Orange City Council [1995] NSWLEC 103, where the Court took into account as a factor in mitigation, in the context of an offence against s 16 of the Clean Waters Act 1970, that the provision of a swimming pool, creek and park was a community benefit and that the council was not carrying out a ""business enterprise"". 
194I accept that the offence was not committed for financial gain and that it was committed whilst the council was providing a service that was beneficial to the community and not a ""business enterprise"". 
195However, I note that there is an obligation on councils who provide services to the community to carry out these services in manner so as to avoid harm to the environment.
Foreseeability of the Risk of Harm
196The extent to which the council could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused by the commission of the offence is, the EPA submitted, a relevant factor to be taken into account in the determination of sentence (s 241(1)(c) of the Act).
197By contrast, the council submitted that the De Simoni principle precluded the Court from considering the matters in ss 241(1)(b) (the practical measures that could be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm), 241(1)(c) (the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence) and 241(1)(d) (the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence), because each factor involved elements of the offence under s 116 of the Act.  
198In support of its submission the council relied on the decision in R v Crump (NSWCCA, 30 May 1994, unreported) where it was held that facts that of themselves would warrant punishment for a more serious offence should be excluded from consideration. Hunt CJ at CL opined: 
In my opinion, however, it is now well settled that a sentencing judge may take into account all the conduct of the prisoner, including that which would aggravate the offence, but may not take into account as matters of aggravation facts established in the evidence which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence or which would have rendered the prisoner liable to a more serious penalty than that which is prescribed for the offence to which he has pleaded guilty-or of which he has been found guilty. That is clearly stated by Gibbs CJ (at 389, 392).
It has sometimes been argued in this Court that this principle applies also to exclude as an aggravating feature any fact established in the evidence if that fact would by itself have rendered the offender guilty of any other offence, whether or not that other offence would have rendered the offender liable to a more serious penalty than that to which he is liable for the offence for which he is being sentenced. That is not so. At first blush, the early eighteenth century principle to which Gibbs CJ referred in of his judgment (at 389) would support such an argument, but the modern authorities which the Chief Justice went on to discuss (at 389-391) make it clear that such a fact should be excluded only where it would have made the offender liable to a more serious penalty.

199It has been held that the De Simoni principle continues to apply notwithstanding the statutory obligation to take into account the aggravating factors contained in s 21A(2) of the CSPA (Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; (2010) 199 A Crim R 38 at [50], McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439 at [39] and Cassidy at [1]). The justification for this course is the obligation not to have regard to any aggravating factor if to do so would be contrary to any rule of law, statutory or otherwise (s 21A(4) of the CSPA and Cassidy at [1]).
200But no equivalent to s 21A(4) of the CSPA is contained in the Act in respect of the matters the Court ""is to take into consideration"" as clearly proscribed by s 241 of the Act. Thus in, for example, Tea Garden Farms the Court had no hesitation in considering the matters contained in s 241(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the Act notwithstanding the presence of the offence created by s 116 (at [86]-[95]). In my opinion, the same result must follow.
201The council further submitted that because contravention of s 116 of the Act requires the harm to have been foreseeable to a reasonable person in the position of the defendant (citing NSW Sugar Milling Co-operative Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority (1992) 59 A Crim R 6 per Hunt CJ at CL at 7) and because s 241(1)(c) of the Act states that the Court is to take into consideration the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm, the foreseeability of actual or likely harm is a necessary component of the offence created by s 116 of the Act and cannot be considered by the Court as a factor in aggravation in the determination of an appropriate sentence.
202Moreover, because the breach of duty of care in respect of negligence is characterised by a failure to take reasonable care and that this enquiry in the context of s 116 of the Act would include whether the council had control over the causes of the offence and whether there were practical measures available to prevent the offence, this similarly precluded consideration of these factors by the Court in determining an appropriate sentence.
203But as was stated in Gordon Plath of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Fish [2010] NSWLEC 144; (2010) 179 LGERA 386 at [81], albeit in relation to an offence against s 118 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, ""in the criminal context, negligence means more than a breach of a duty of care"". Further, to amount to criminal negligence (at [81]):
... the degree of carelessness must be such as to show such a disregard for the objects of the statute as to amount to a crime against the state (R v Bateman [1925] All ER Rep 45; (1925) 19 Cr App R 8; see also Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576 per Lord Atkin at 583; applied in Cittadini v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 302 at [38]-[40]). For there to be negligence, there must have been an indifference to an obvious risk (R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226 at 247, applied in Cittadini).
204I do not consider on the existing authorities that the De Simoni principle prevents me from considering those factors set out in s 241(1)(b), (c) or (d) of the Act because these matters could not of themselves necessarily make the council liable for the more serious offence of negligently causing water pollution. It is possible, for example, to find that the council had control over the causes and that there were practicable measures available to the council to prevent, control, abate or mitigate the harm but to stop short of finding that the council was, on the facts, criminally negligent in committing the offence. 
205I therefore find that to the extent that these factors do not result in a finding of negligence, that I am able to take into account the matters proscribed in s 241(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the Act (s 241(1)(e) is irrelevant). 
206Accordingly, in respect of s 241(1)(c), given that there had already been a recent failure of the pump, given that the reason for the failure had not been identified, given that the council did not know whether the failure with the telemetry system had been fixed and whether a SMS would be sent to the on-call supervisor if there was another pump failure, given that the pump station only had a limited storage capacity for untreated sewage if there was a pump failure and given that the council did not take any steps to monitor the Morisset St station, I find that the council could readily have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence (Baiada at [29]). 
207Put another way, it was foreseeable that harm would be caused to the environment in circumstances where it may be reasonably be inferred that the council  was aware that raw sewage was not designed for release to the environment and that such release was likely to be or had the potential to be harmful to human health, particularly in light of the extent of the volume of the overflow (nearly 1.1ML).
Control Over the Causes of Harm and the Practical Measures Available to the Council to Avoid It
208As the authority responsible for the running, monitoring and maintenance of the sewerage system, including the Morisset St station, as well as the employer of the people carrying out the monitoring of the station, it follows that the council had complete control over the causes that gave rise to the offence (s 241(1)(d) of the Act). 
209Further, as the EPA submitted, there were practical measures available to the council to prevent, control, abate or mitigate the harm (s 241(1)(b) of the Act), namely, the council could have implemented a procedure that directed on-call supervisors to act if there was a failure of the SMS paging system; Mr Pearson could have been given specific training on what to do if the SMS paging system failed; and someone could have personally monitored the depot or the Morisset St station after the pump failure on 4 November 2007 or ensured someone was available to remotely monitor the operation of the depot on a laptop.
The Offence is One of Moderate Objective Gravity
210Having regard to the factors discussed above, particularly the potential harm that could have resulted from commission of the offence in light of the high volume of sewage that escaped, the foreseeability of the environmental harm and the practical measures that were available to the council to avoid the pollution, I find that the offence committed is one of moderate objective gravity. 
211I am reinforced in this finding by the fact that the council did not notify the users of the Queanbeyan River, the Department of Health or the EPA of the overflow as outlined in the council's own policy.
The Subjective Circumstances of the Council
212In determining an appropriate sentence the Court must take into account the mitigating and aggravating factors personal to the council (s 21A(2) and (3) of the CSPA).
213The subjective circumstances of the council relevantly include: 
(a)  any prior criminal record; 
(b)  any plea of guilty; 
(c)  any contrition and remorse expressed; 
(d)  the council's good character; and 
(e)  any cooperation with, and assistance to, the regulatory  authorities provided by the council.
Prior Criminality
214The council has one prior conviction for a criminal offence (s 21A(3)(e) of the CSPA). 
215The Council was convicted by the Court on 20 November 1996 and fined $10,000 for an offence against s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970. The offence involved the discharge of approximately 68,000 litres of raw sewage into the Queanbeyan River from the Lochile St sewage pumping station. In that case the station alarm system was, again, not activated.  
216The EPA submitted that the prior criminality of the council should be taken into consideration as an aggravating factor because the current offence arose out of a similar factual matrix as the prior conviction and manifested ""a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law"" (Veen v R (No 2) at 477).
217The council, while accepting that the prior offence could be taken into account by the Court in determining the appropriate sentence, submitted that very little or no weight should be attributed to it because it represented a lone aberration in an otherwise faultless history of operating the sewerage system for over 80 years and because the passage of time had rendered the prior conviction less relevant. Further, the council noted that the prior offence was occasioned by an error on the part of the council's telemetry contractor, which and was rectified. 
218It is true that the offence occurred over a decade before the commission of the offence currently before the Court for sentencing, but given the factual similarity to the current offence, it is my view that the Court should give it some weight, although admittedly not much given the passage of time, and should not treat it ""neutrally"" as proffered by the council. However, I do not find that this single prior conviction, which occured over a decade ago, manifests a continuing attitude of disobedience with environmental laws so as to warrant a more severe penalty being imposed. 
Plea of Guilty
219The council withdrew its plea of not guilty, entered on 5 June 2009, and entered a plea of guilty on 20 September 2011, which was one week before a contested hearing on liability was scheduled to commence. The council is still entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, although the discount must necessarily be limited given the circumstances of the late entry of the plea (R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and ss 21A(3)(k) and 22 of the CSPA). 
220The EPA submitted that, given the substantial delay in the entering of the guilty plea, its utilitarian value had been eroded so that the council was entitled to no discount or only a limited discount in the amount of 10%. Further, the EPA submitted that the offence was such that the interest and protection of the public suggested that no discount, or only the most minimal, was warranted (R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [157]-[158]). 
221Generally, the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if a plea is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is wholly diminished (Rae at [63] citing R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1). In this case the utilitarian value of the guilty plea has been significantly eroded. However, I do not consider this case, as was submitted by the EPA, as falling into the category of cases where the public interest requires no discount to be imposed. The entering of the plea still avoided the time and expense of having to hear and determine a contested charge. The circumstances of the guilty plea, therefore, should warrant a discount of 15%. 
Contrition and Remorse
222The contrition or remorse of an offender must be taken into account as a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence (s 21A(3)(i) of the CSPA). 223In Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation  Preston J stated that contrition and remorse is more readily demonstrated by an offender ""taking actions"" rather than offering ""smooth apologies"" through legal representatives (at [203]).  His Honour identified four forms of actions that would demonstrate genuine contrition and remorse (at [204])-[214]).  These are:
(a) first, the speed and efficiency of action rectifying the harm caused or likely to continue to be caused by the commission of the offence (at [204]);
(b) second, the voluntary reporting of the commission of the offence and any consequential environmental harm to the authorities (at [210]);
(c) third, taking action to address the cause of the offence (at [212]); and
(d) fourth, the appearance of council officers in court and evidence of the council's regret with a plan of action to avoid repetition of the offence (at [214]).
224Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation was relied upon and applied by Craig J recently in Environment Protection Authority v Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 65 and Environment Protection Authority v Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2012] NSWLEC 80.  
225The council submitted that it expressed contrition and remorse through the affidavit of Mr Hansen and that it has taken steps to ensure that a similar offence does not occur in the future. 
226The EPA submitted that the council, by blaming it for the occurrence of the offence because of the requirement to move the retention structure from the Riverside Caravan Park, demonstrated a lack of a sense of responsibility and contrition. Further, the EPA submitted that the fact that the council moved to have the proceedings stayed on the basis that it should have been issued a licence that would have provided it with a defence under s 122 (see Queanbeyan No 1) of the Act demonstrated a serious lack of concern for the health of the waterways within its jurisdiction. 
227The EPA additionally contended that a ""self-serving"" statement by an employee of the council provided late into the sentence hearing did not constitute evidence of the genuine contrition and remorse required for that mitigating factor to be satisfied. It was submitted that the contrition and remorse of the council had to be judged in the circumstances of the council's conduct, with particular regard being had to the fact that the council failed to report the overflow the subject of the charge. 
228I do not entirely agree. The council was entitled to defend itself and the fact that it initially pleaded not guilty and sought to have the proceedings stayed does not derogate from what must be accepted as a genuine expression of contrition and remorse in the affidavit of Mr Hansen (Mr Hansen's evidence was not challenged). Further, the council's post offence conduct has demonstrated that it has taken responsibility for its actions by taking steps to improve staff support; to improve the monitoring system; and to upgrade the sewage treatment plant. The fact that the council was initially not aware that there was an overflow does not deprive it of the benefit of these remedial actions. 
229Having said this, there is some force in the EPA's contentions with respect to the council's conduct during the proceedings that does serve to blunt the efficacy of its apology, but only to a minimal degree.
230I accept that both the evidence of Mr Hansen and the actions of the council since the commission of the offence do demonstrate remorse within the context of s 21A(3)(i) of the CSPA and that at least three of the four forms of action demonstrating genuine contrition and remorse identified by Preston J in Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation have been demonstrated.  Although the council voluntarily reported the commission of the offence, in doing so it also reported that there was no concomitant environmental harm insofar as the report initially stated that there was no overflow.
Good Character
231With the exception of the earlier conviction, the council has demonstrated to the Court evidence of good character that should be taken into account as a mitigating factor (s 21A(3)(f) of the CSPA).
232As the evidence of Mr Hansen outlined above demonstrates, in addition to introducing and following procedural measures designed to address the deficiencies in the council's processes that led to the commission of the offence, the council has now completed the replacement of the Morisset St station. The cost of the replacement of the Morisset St station is estimated to be $6.8 million.
233I have also taken into account the extensive evidence of Ms Abbott detailing the extensive range of projects that the council both directly and indirectly carries out (or funds) for the improvement of the environment, including the Queanbeyan River.  
Assistance to the Authorities 
234The assistance by the council to regulatory authorities must be taken into account as a factor mitigating the penalty to be imposed (ss 21A(3)(m) and 23 of the CSPA). In looking at the significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance to the authority concerned, it is necessary to take into consideration any evaluation by the authority of the assistance rendered (s 23(2)(b) of the CSPA).
235The council submitted that it cooperated in the investigation of the offence by ensuring that staff members were available for interviews, without requiring notices under the Act. The council also submitted that it complied with a number of statutory notices requiring the provision of documents and information and participated in the compilation of an agreed statement of facts. 
236By contrast, the EPA argued that the council failed to report the offence, provided no assistance to the authorities, and instead interfered with the investigation of the offence. This lack of assistance was submitted as being particularly egregious in circumstances where the council is a public authority with a duty to assist in the prevention of pollution and where the council should have conducted itself in a manner in keeping with a model defendant. 
237As the evidence contained in the statement of agreed facts establishes, the council, through its employees Mr Laws and Mr Pearson, became aware that there was a second pump failure on 5 November 2007. 
238On 5 November 2007, Mr Webb called Mr Sargent of DECC to report ""a sewer overflow from a manhole in Waniassa St this morning.""  Mr Webb stated that he did not know how much sewage was discharged and whether it had reached the Queanbeyan River. Mr Sargent requested that the overflow be investigated and that a report of the offence be furnished to him. 
239On 7 November 2007, Mr Webb emailed Mr Sargent the report of the overflow. The report only detailed the spill on 4 November 2007 not the subject of the charge. 
240On 10 December 2007, the council provided another report to the EPA entitled ""Report of Sewer Overflow to the Queanbeyan River on 4 November 2007"", which stated in relation to the offence:
A similar sequence of failures occured at 18:36:10 but owing to there being no undue flow volumes no overflow occurred.
241On 28 October 2008, the council was issued, and subsequently complied, with a notice to provide information and/or records in relation to any overflow from the Morisset St station on 4 and 5 November 2007. 
242On 22 August 2008, Mr Fogarty, the nominated representative of the council, and Mr Webb participated in interviews where they both stated that the advice that was given, or the information that was reported, to them was that there was a second pump failure but that this did not result in an overflow.
243There is no evidence before the Court that the council was being deliberately misleading or trying to interfere with the investigation of the EPA in reporting that the advice it had received indicated that there had not been a second overflow, that is to say, the overflow the subject of the charge. 
244But by not carrying out a thorough investigation into what had occurred on the evening of 4 November until the morning of 5 November 2007, the reliability of any information provided by the council and its employees was severely circumscribed and necessitated the EPA carrying out its own investigation into what occurred on 4 and 5 November 2007. 
245Further, the fact that all the interviews with the council's staff were, with the exception of the interview of Mr Daniels, directed interviews, cannot be ignored. Moreover, in his interview Mr Fogarty denied the commission of the offence. Mr Fogarty was the council's nominated representative for the purpose of answering questions under s 203 of the Act.
246Having regard to the evidence before the Court I find that the council did provide some assistance, but only to a limited degree. It results in a very modest reduction in penalty pursuant to s 23 of the CSPA. In this regard, I have also noted that, in preparation for the sentencing hearing, the council provided assistance by the preparation of a statement of agreed facts.
Costs
247The Court is empowered to order an offender to pay the prosecutor's costs as specified or as may be determined pursuant to ss 257B and 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
248The payment of a prosecutor's costs is an aspect of punishment (Environment Protection Authority v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 at [78] and Rae at [68]) and may be considered in the determination of the appropriate penalty, including as a factor that acts in the reduction of any penalty to be imposed.
249The council has agreed to pay the EPA's costs as agreed in the amounts of $343,000 by way of legal costs and $1,189 by way of investigative costs and expenses. On any view these costs are, although not unreasonable, substantial. I therefore take the quantum of these costs into account. 
Conclusion on Subjective Considerations
250The subjective considerations of the council operate to mitigate to a limited degree the penalty that would otherwise be imposed by the Court.
The Appropriate Sentence to be Imposed on the Council
251The imposition of a sentence serves a number of purposes. As s 3A of the CSPA sets out, these purposes include retribution and denunciation, as well as deterrence, both specific and general.
Deterrence
252The sentence must be sufficient to specifically deter the council from repeating the conduct that resulted in the commission of the offence in the future in the hope that only nominal penalties will be applied. There is also a need for the sentence to serve as a general deterrent to prevent others committing similar offences against the Act (Snowy Hydro at [206] and Axer at 367).
253The EPA submitted that an element of specific deterrence should be incorporated into the penalty. This was because the council was, despite its recent efforts to replace the pump station, a recidivist offender. The EPA submitted that the Court should have regard to, not only the previous offence in 1996, but also the previous overflows referred to above that did not result in prosecution but were the subject of the first and second prevention notices. 
254By contrast, the council submitted that there is not a likelihood of it re-offending because the Morisset St station has now been replaced and the telemetry system has been upgraded so that the circumstances in which this offence occurred cannot be repeated. 
255Although I acknowledge that the council has undergone a review and upgrade of the pump station and put into place procedures and monitoring processes to ensure that similar offences are not committed again in the future, I find that there is a need to include specific deterrence as a component of the penalty, especially given the prior criminal and non-criminal history of the council in polluting waters.
256The parties agreed, and I find, that the sentence must serve as a general deterrent to those operating sewerage systems to ensure that they carry out all activities with the aim of avoiding water pollution. The fine needs to be large enough to make it worthwhile that these precautions, irrespective of their cost, be undertaken by such authorities (Snowy Hydro at [207]). 
Denunciation and Retribution
257The imposition of an appropriate sentence serves the purpose of ensuring that retribution and denunciation are properly addressed. The sentence of this Court is a public denunciation of the conduct of council and must ensure that the council is held accountable for its actions and is adequately punished (Rae at [8]-[9], and ss 3A(a) and (e) of the CSPA). Accordingly, I also take these elements of sentencing into account.
Consistency in Sentencing
258A relevant consideration in sentencing is the ascertainment of the existence of a general pattern of sentencing by the Court for offences such as the offence in question (Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [179]-[182] and Rae at [69]). The proper approach is for the Court to look at whether the sentence is within the range appropriate to the gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence that merely forms part of that range (Gittany at [182]).
259Of course care must be taken because each case is different and a sentence in one case does not demonstrate the limits of a sentencing judge's discretion, given the wide divergence of facts and circumstances leading to the imposition of specific penalties (Axer at 365, Cabonne Shire Council v Environment Protection Authority [2001] NSWCCA 280; (2001) 115 LGERA 304 at 312 and Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [54]). 
260The EPA submitted that the pattern of sentencing against which the present case falls to be considered was examined by Preston J in the case of Rae (at [77], [79]-[83], [86] and [88]-[89]). However, I do not see how it assists the Court in determining a general pattern of sentencing for the offence against s 120 of the Act because the cases considered by his Honour therein concerned offences against s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
261The council referred the Court to a number of cases that concerned offences against s 120 of the Act, including: Environment Protection Authority v Sibelco Australia Limited [2011] NSWLEC 160, Environment Protection Authority v Chillana Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 255, Environment Protection Authority v Ramsay Food Processing Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 23, Environment Protection Authority v Albury City Council [2009] NSWLEC 169, Baiada and Snowy Hydro. 
262In Sibelco waters were polluted with sediment-laden water discharged from the defendant's property as a result of a dam wall failing. There was actual and potential harm caused to the waters in the low to moderate range. The overall objective gravity of the offence was considered to be in the low to moderate range. There were no aggravating factors. However, there were a number of mitigating factors applicable to the defendant, including that the defendant pleaded guilty at an early opportunity; the defendant expressed contrition and remorse; the defendant provided assistance to the authorities; and the defendant agreed to pay the prosecutor's costs. The Court imposed a penalty of $78,000 to be paid to Hunter Central Rivers Catchment Management Authority for general environmental purposes and made a publication order. 
263In Chillana a cracked pipe led to 98,000 litres of untreated abattoir effluent spilling into a nearby creek and river. The pipe was fractured as a result of contact with an underground rock. There was significant actual environmental harm to the creek that had the potential to last several months. The defendant had one prior conviction but was found unlikely to reoffend; the defendant expressed remorse; the defendant entered an early guilty plea; and the defendant was found to have cooperated fully with the authorities. The Court ordered the defendant to pay the Land and Property Management Authority the sum of $60,000, to be applied to a restoration and enhancement project, and to pay the prosecutors' legal costs as agreed or assessed and the prosecutor's investigation costs of $16,070.58.
264In Ramsay untreated effluent escaped from the defendant's abattoir as the result of a split pipe and a valve being opened. The defendant in that case had a pollution record; the environmental harm was serious; there was evidence of mortality among aquatic life and potential harm to human health; and the utilitarian value of the guilty plea was reduced. Justice Biscoe fined the defendant $50,000 for the pollution of waters offences and ordered the defendant to the pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs. However, the reason for the fine being only $50,000, given the extent of harm, was that his Honour found that the offence was caused by an unauthorised third party tampering with the effluent pumps. 
265In Albury City Council a pump failure caused sewage effluent to overflow from a manhole discharging via a gutter into a stormwater drain leading to a stormwater gully and then into the Murray River. There was no actual harm caused by the commission of the offence, but there was a potential for harm. There were practical measures available to the council to prevent, control, mitigate or abate the harm, but the offence was at the lower end of reasonable foreseeability. Overall, the offence was considered to be of low objective gravity. Further, there were no aggravating factors present and there were a number of mitigating factors, including: the defendant did not have any prior convictions; the defendant demonstrated good character; the defendant pleaded guilty at an early stage; the defendant expressed contrition and remorse; and the defendant cooperated and provided assistance to the authorities. The Court imposed a fine of $45,500 and ordered the defendant to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the amount of $18,044. 
266In Baiada the offence involved approximately 1ML of effluent from Baiada's poultry rendering plant escaping from a defective weld in an underground pipeline. The effluent descended into an unnamed watercourse in a paddock owned by Baiada. The effluent flowed down the watercourse for approximately 1.1kms. The actual environmental harm was found to be very small and the evidence did not establish likely harm to the environment. The offence was reasonably foreseeable and there were practical measures available to Baiada to prevent the harm. Subjectively, the defendant had four prior convictions; the defendant had expressed contrition and remorse; the defendant had entered an early plea of guilty; and the defendant had provided assistance to the authorities. The Court fined the defendant $160,000 reduced to $120,000 for the early guilty plea.
267In Snowy Hydro, in a series of related events occurring over four days, somewhere between four and eleven tonnes of sediment were discharged into the Snowy River as a result of the works that a contractor for Snowy Hydro was carrying out associated with the Jindabyne Dam. This sediment comprised soil, earth, clay or similar inorganic matter. It was accepted that environmental harm was in the lower range. The offence was described as being of moderate objective seriousness. The subjective circumstances considered included that the defendant had no prior convictions; that it had pleaded guilty at an early stage; that it had expressed remorse; that it had devoted considerable resources to mitigating the harm occasioned by the offence; and that it had fully co-operated with the authorities. Snowy Hydro was fined the sum of $100,000 and was also ordered to pay the prosecutor's legal costs in the sum of $84,289 as well as its investigation costs in the sum of $1,897.50. The contractor to Snowy Hydro was convicted of an identical offence arising from the same circumstances as those that gave rise to the prosecution of Snowy Hydro (Environment Protection Authority v Fulton Hogan Pty Ltd [2008] NSWLEC 268; (2008) 163 LGERA 345). A fine of $100,000 after allowing discount for an early guilty plea was also imposed upon that defendant.
268In addition to the above cases dealing with offences under s 120 of the Act, the council also referred the Court to the case of Environment Protection Authority v State of New South Wales [2010] NSWLEC 67; (2010) 174 LGERA 19. That case concerned an offence against s 64(1) of the Act. In that case, the defendant was the holder of an environment protection licence, a condition of which was breached in that it failed to operate equipment in a proper and efficient manner. The offence was the result of an employee mistakenly believing matter was safe to be released, which resulted in 151KL of partially treated effluent being discharged into Perisher Creek. The discharge consisted of a mixture of sewage sludge and its supernatant. There was no environmental harm caused by the offence and the likelihood of environmental harm was low. The foreseeability of the offence was low because of the difficulty of an employer foreseeing that an experienced operator would deviate from standard practice. There were also a number of mitigating factors present. The Court ordered the defendant to pay the Southern Rivers Catchment Management Authority the amount of $80,000 for the purpose of riparian rehabilitation and exotic tree removal and to pay the prosecutor's costs of $65,000. By reason of the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the offence with which the defendant was charged, this case is of limited assistance in the determination of the appropriate penalty in the present case.
269Several other water pollution cases, which were not referred to by the parties, are worth examining for the purpose of ensuring parity. 
270In Environment Protection Authority v Centennial Newstan Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 211, an incident occurred at the Newstan Colliery at Fassifern, south of Newcastle, resulting in the pollution of a nearby creek, which flowed into Lake Macquarie. The Court accepted that the environmental harm was in the relatively low range but that there were a number of measures that could, and should, have been taken to prevent the harm that occurred. The offence was not committed deliberately and the defendant gained no commercial advantage by its commission, rather the pollution occurred because the defendant failed to have in place a system to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants from its pipeline system. The offence was considered to be one of moderate objective gravity. The defendant entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and the defendant's cooperation with authorities in relation to the management and clean up of pollutants was forthright and fulsome. The defendant was ordered to pay Lake Macquarie City Council the sum of $105,000 to fund the Council's Ecosystem Enhancement Operations Program in the Stony Creek catchment and publicise the offence in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Newcastle Herald newspapers. The defendant was also ordered to pay the prosecutor's costs, including investigation expenses, in the sum of $38,500.
271In Environment Protection Authority v Straits (Hillgrove) Gold Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 114; (2010) 174 LGERA 314, the defendant company pleaded guilty to one charge under s 120(1) of the Act. Between 1,000 and 3,000 tonnes of toxic slime material spilled from the defendant's gold and antimony plant, travelled a distance of over 300m along a road, 200m over a grassed area and along the dry bed of a creek. The slime did not reach the waters of the creek and the potential harm to the receiving waters was considered to be very low. Following the incident, the defendant cleaned up the slime, cooperated in every respect with the prosecutor's investigation and implemented several internal changes to ensure that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The defendant entered a guilty plea at the first available opportunity, had no prior convictions and formally expressed regret for the occurrence of the incident. A fine of $50,000 was imposed following a discount in the penalty by 33%. The defendant was also ordered to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the sum of $24,000.
272In Environment Protection Authority v George Weston Foods Limited [2010] NSWLEC 120, the defendant company pleaded guilty to a charge of polluting waters, which resulted from an incident involving the discharge of a blend of animal tallow and vegetable oil from the defendant's stock feed manufacturing plant into the Peel River, which runs through several public parks and into the City of Tamworth. The cause of the incident was found by the defendant to be undetected corrosion in the welded joint of a steam pipe, resulting in the creation of a small hole through which oil and tallow became entrained with steam passing through that pipe. The principal effect of the pollution was a reduction in the aesthetic and recreational value of the Peel River, which extended over 2.25kms and was apparent for a period of nine days. Samples indicated these sections of the River contained an oil and grease content of between 100 and 800 times higher than background levels, resulting in water quality being reduced below Australian and New Zealand standards. Although Craig J accepted that the incident was an accident, his Honour held that it was nonetheless reasonably foreseeable. There were practical measures available that the defendant could and should have taken to prevent the offence and to clean up the pollution. The offence was classified as being towards, but not at, the lower range of objective gravity. The defendant pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, cooperated in the investigation of the incident and demonstrated contrition and remorse. The defendant was ordered to pay $67,000 to Tamworth Regional Council to fund the Peel River Riparian Project, to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the sum of $30,000, and to publicise the offence.
273In Environment Protection Authority v Ramsay Food Processing Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] NSWLEC 175 the defendant company was found guilty of an offence under s 120 of the Act (Environment Protection Authority v Ramsay Food Processing Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 150) for allowing a mixture of animal tallow and waste water to flow from its abattoir into Musk Valley Creek. Over a period of four to five days, a length of 100m of the creek was moderately affected by the spill, which settled on the creek surface as scum, contributing to deoxygenation of the waters to the point that the water became ""black"" and anaerobic in places. The actual environmental harm was considered to be minor because it was restricted to a relatively small section and there was limited potential for it to cause long-term impact to the creek. The defendant company, with numerous recorded incidents and/or court appearances, had a poor record in environmental matters. The defendant expressed some remorse and offered assistance to authorities. The objective seriousness of the offence was considered to be at the lower end of the scale. There were several practical measures that the defendant could and should have taken to prevent the incident, including supervision of the premises during the night, taking precautions to ensure the drainage system was not blocked, and undertaking regular clearing of the premises.  Bearing these factors in mind, Sheahan J was disposed to impose of fine of $100,000, absent any discount. Instead, his Honour ordered the defendant company to carry out an environmental audit of the premises, estimated to cost $84,450.30, and implement steps to prevent the continuance or recurrence of the offence. The defendant was also ordered to publicise the offence and to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs.
274In Environment Protection Authority v Big River Group Pty Ltd [2011] NSWLEC 80 the defendant pleaded guilty to a charge pursuant to s 120 of the Act. It admitted that during 29 and 30 November 2009 a pollutant containing approximately 6,000 litres of a dangerous liquid resin was spilt, that flowed into a stormwater drain and onto a wetland.  Samples taken on 30 November and 2 December 2009 found levels of formaldehyde, phenol and pH to be significantly above acceptable limits, which caused actual harm to the wetland environment over an area of approximately 1.7ha. The pollution also had the potential effects of being toxic to livestock and affecting the health and distribution of wetland dependent fauna. It was, however, found that the effects would not be long lasting, and thereafter, the environmental harm was classified as being in the low to moderate range. Several practical measures existed that the company should have taken to control or mitigate the harm. However, following the incident, Big River cooperated with the prosecutor in the investigation of the pollution spill, entered a plea of guilty to the charge on a first return date and took several steps to prevent future spills, including making plans for the rebuilding of the entire plant. The Court imposed a fine of $67,000, following a discount of 33%, and ordered the defendant to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the sum of $59,644.80.
275The defendant in Environment Protection Authority v Austar Coal Mine Pty Ltd [2011] NSWLEC 252 pleaded guilty to the offence of polluting waters for causing an unknown amount of water containing two pollutants, a detergent and effluent from a bathhouse, to escape into Bellbird Creek and travel 2km downstream to Doyle St dam. The detergent in the effluent caused white foam and elevated levels or methylene blue active substances, nutrients and faecal coliforms along sections of the creek. Potential harm was also caused to aquatic biota. Austar took actions to contain the pollution and flush the creek to mitigate the harm, and overall the harm was considered to be low. The offence was not committed negligently, however, there were further practical measures that could have been taken to prevent the occurrence of the incident, which was foreseeable. Austar had been issued with two penalty notices relating to this and a similar incident, however these were not considered to demonstrate a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. An early plea of guilty entitled the defendant to a 25% discount in the penalty. Contrition, remorse and assistance to authorities were also demonstrated. The Court considered that a fine of $75,000 would be an appropriate penalty, but ordered that the amount be paid to the Hunter-Central Rivers Catchment Management Authority for the Mount View Corridor Threatened Species Habitat Rehabilitation Project. The defendant was also ordered to publicise the offence and to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigative costs in the sum of $42,264.13.
276Moolarben Coal Operations (No 1) concerned the discharge of sediment-laden water into Bora Creek near Ulan in New South Wales, which flowed into the Goulburn River, resulting from four discrete events occurring between 8 and 23 June 2009. The defendant pleaded guilty to a charge under s 120 of the Act. Although there was no evidence of actual harm to the environment apart from the visual effect of the discharge and elevated levels of suspended solids, turbidity and nutrients, the increased nutrient levels had the potential to cause harm to aquatic ecosystems and biota, including via the development of algal blooms. The environmental harm, particularly in the long term, was considered to be at the lower end of the range. As a condition of project approval for the coal mine, the defendant prepared a Water Management Plan, a component of which was an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan. The defendant had chosen not to carry out the majority of the erosion and sediment control measures indicated by the Plan, which constituted evidence of practical measures that the defendant should have taken to prevent the incident. The defendant acknowledged that the primary cause of pollution was the undertaking of earthworks without first completing sediment and erosion control structures. Although the discharge was not deliberate, no explanation was provided as to why these measures had not been taken. The incident was foreseeable and mitigation was within the defendant's control. The offence was considered to be of medium or mid range objective seriousness. The defendant entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and expressed contrition, however no actions were taken to alleviate the consequences of the discharges. The defendant cooperated with the investigation and agreed to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the sum of $61,632. A fine of $105,000 was imposed, following a discount of 30%.
277Moolarben Coal Operations was charged with a further offence of polluting waters arising from a similar incident on 27 December 2009 (Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd (No 2)). By this time, several interim erosion and sediment control measures had been completed since the June discharges, however these were not intended to replace the measures that were identified in the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan. An environmental audit was undertaken on 4 December 2009 wherein a number of ""key erosion and sediment control deficiencies"" were identified in the rail loop area. A number of recommended measures were commenced, but had not been completed, by 27 December. On that day, a large rainfall event occurred, resulting in the discharge of approximately 18.7ML of sediment-laden water into Bora Creek and the Goulburn River. Approximately 800m of the creek and river confluence was visibly polluted by sediment and increased levels of turbidity and total suspended solids above Australian and New Zealand standards had the potential to affect aquatic ecosystems and biota. The harm was classified as low to moderate. Again, there were practical measures available that should have been taken to prevent or mitigate the harm. The foreseeability of harm arising from the failure to carry out the works specified in the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and as a result of the audit was apparent from the terms of the Plan and the audit recommendations. Although the discharge was not deliberate, the defendant took a number of risks by implementing temporary erosion and sediment control measures that were not reasonably justified. The offence was classified as one of medium or moderate objective gravity. The defendant's actions in voluntarily reporting the commission of the offence, taking action to address the cause of the offence and in expressing regret demonstrated genuine contrition and remorse. The defendant was fined $112,500, discounted by 25% to allow for the early plea of guilty, ordered to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the sum of $63,314 and ordered to publicise the offence.
278Finally, the case of Environment Protection Authority v Pipeline Drillers Group Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 18 involved two charges under s 120 of the Act for the discharge of a bentonite slurry into the Partridge Creek wetland near Port Macquarie. Each discharge occurred while the defendant was undertaking horizontal drilling beneath the wetland. An initial incident involving the escape of bentonite slurry into the rock substrate did not form the subject of any charges. A second similar incident occurred six days later. As a result, drilling ceased temporarily and sandbags were put in place to contain the pollutant. Upon discovery of a third incident, on 17 November 2009, all drilling ceased and a clean up of the site commenced. The incident occasioned actual environmental harm over approximately 120ha, including the smothering of some plants, and indirect harm to related species. There was some evidence of potential harm to the threatened Wallum Froglet species. However, having regard to the apparent absence of long-term impact, the overall environmental harm was classified as low. There were further steps that could have been taken to prevent the harm that occurred, however, once the escape of bentonite slurry was discovered, the defendant acted promptly to control, abate and mitigate the harm. The pollution incidents were accidental and the defendant gained no financial advantage from the commission of the offences, however it was considered that the punishment should reflect an element of general deterrence. A plea of guilty was entered at an early stage and the defendant cooperated at all stages of the proceedings. Taking into account the totality principle and a 25% discount for the early guilty plea, the defendant was fined $18,000 for the first offence and $12,000 for the second offence. The defendant was also ordered to publicise the offence and to pay the prosecutor's legal and investigation costs in the sum of $44,000.
279I find the facts of the offence with which the council has been charged to be less serious than those present in Chillana, Ramsay and Moolarben Coal (Nos 1 and 2), but more serious than those underlying the imposition of the penalty in Albury City Council, Centennial Newstan, Big River, George Weston Foods and Pipeline Drillers. The cases that serve as the most relevant comparators are, in my opinion, those of Sibelco, Snowy Hydro, Baiada and Austar.  
Conclusion on Penalty
280Synthesising the objective circumstances of the commission of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the council and the general pattern of sentencing for offences such as the one committed by the council, I consider that the imposition of a monetary penalty of $100,000, discounted by 20% to $80,000 for subjective mitigating factors, including the late plea of guilty, would otherwise be appropriate. In determining this penalty I have taken into account the considerable quantum of costs that the council has agreed to pay.
Type of Penalty to be Imposed
281Both the prosecutor and the council submitted that this was a case in which it was appropriate for the Court to make an order under s 250(1)(e) of the Act. This provision enables the Court to order an offender: 
...to pay a specified amount to ...a specified organisation, for the purposes of a specified project for the restoration or enhancement of the environment or for general environmental purposes.
282An order for such a payment may be made in lieu of the imposition of a fine (Austar at [48], Tea Garden Farms at [148]-[152] and Centennial Newstan at [92]).
283The parties have agreed that the Numeralla East Landscape Project is suitable for such an order for the following reasons:
The project has commenced and is currently funded by the NSW Government through the Murrumbidgee Catchment Management Authority;It is anticipated that the project will take three (3) year and involves a series of soil and water conservation works in the Numeralla East sub-catchment;The aim of the project is to work with landholders, Landcare, Local Government and NSW Crown Lands to implement works that will improve fish habitat and water quality in the catchment; andAdditional funding would allow the implementation of further erosion control works with a complimentary and management program to proceed as negotiated with landholders via a property vegetation plan.
284Having regard to s 250(1)(c) of the Act, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to direct the monetary penalty that would otherwise be imposed by the Court to this project.  
285The EPA has sought, and the council has agreed, that in addition a publication order should be made pursuant to s 250(1)(a) of the Act. The order requires the council to publish a notice in the newspapers identified by the parties to record the commission of the offence and the council's contribution to the project identified above. I accept that a publication order in the manner described is appropriate in the present case.
Orders
286The Court therefore makes the following orders:
(1) the council is convicted of the offence as charged against s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997;
(2) pursuant to s 250(1)(e) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, within 28 days of these orders the council must pay the Murrumbidgee Catchment Management Authority the sum of $80,000 to be used for the Numeralla East Landscape Project; 
(3) all future public references by the council to its contribution to the Murrumbidgee Catchment Management Authority Numeralla East Landscape Project the subject of order 2 above must be accompanied by the following passage:
""Queanbeyan City Council's contribution to the funding of the Murrumbidgee Catchment Management Authority Numeralla East Landscape Project is part of a penalty imposed upon it by the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales after it was convicted of an offence under s 120 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 for polluting the Queanbeyan River and waters downstream thereof"".
(4) the council, pursuant to s 248(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 is to pay the prosecutor's investigative costs and expenses in the sum of $1,189, within 28 days of this order; 
(5) the council is to pay the prosecutor's legal costs in the sum of $343,000, within 28 days of this order;
(6) the council, at its expense and pursuant to s 250(1)(a) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, within 28 days of this order, is to place a notice in the first 12 pages of the early general news section of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Canberra Times and The Queanbeyan Age at a minimum size of 10cm by 20cm in a form attached at Annexure A to these orders; and
(7)  the exhibits are to be returned. 

**********

Annexure ""A""
Queanbeyan City Council
On 18 September 2012, the Land and Environment Court of NSW found Queanbeyan City Council (""the council"") guilty of one charge of water pollution against s 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997.
The Environment Protection Authority prosecuted the council for polluting the waters of the Queanbeyan River, including downstream waters, on or about 4 November to 5 November 2007. 
The pollution incident followed the discharge of sewage from an overflow outlet at a substation situated in Waniassa Street, Queanbeyan, which was operated and controlled by the council. 
Ultimately the council pleaded guilty to the offence. 
The Court found that insignificant environmental harm was caused by the commission of the offence. 
In lieu of the imposition of a fine, the council was ordered to pay the Murrumbidgee Catchment Authority Numeralla East Landscape Project the sum of $80,000 to be used for the Numeralla East Landscape Project.
The council was also ordered to pay the legal costs of the Environment Protection Authority in the sum of $343,000 and investigation costs of $1,189. Further the council was ordered at its expense, to publish this notice.

2760107,R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Grove AJ.

2McCALLUM J: I agree with Grove AJ.

3GROVE AJ: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed on the respondent on 2 March 2012 at East Maitland District Court.

4The respondent there pleaded guilty to an indictment containing 27 counts and asked for a further 20 offences to be taken into account in sentence assessment. Every offence involved sexual misconduct visited upon young males who ranged in age from 8 to 17 years. The indictment consisted of 2 counts of buggery, 4 counts of homosexual intercourse with a male aged between 10 and 18, 2 counts of committing an act of indecency with a male, 1 count of committing an act of gross indecency, 1 count of indecent assault, 1 count of sexual intercourse without consent and 16 counts of assault on a male accompanied by an act of indecency.

5The offences sought to be taken into account on various Forms 1 consisted of 6 charges of aggravated act of indecency with a person under the age of 16 years, 5 charges of homosexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 18 years, 5 charges of indecent assault of a male, 3 charges of committing an act of indecency with a male person and 1 charge of committing an act of gross indecency.

6There were 19 individual victims comprehended within the counts in the indictment and one additional individual victim specified in a charge on a Form 1. There were therefore a total of 20 victims.

7The learned sentencing Judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, the latter specification reflecting a finding of special circumstances which he made. As required, when imposing an aggregate sentence, his Honour expressed indicative terms applicable to the separate counts. Those indications were a term of 12 months' imprisonment on four counts (three assault with an act of indecency; one act of gross indecency); a term of two years' imprisonment on four counts (three assault with an act of indecency; one indecent assault); a term of 2 years and 6 months' imprisonment on 10 counts (assault with an act of indecency); a term of 3 years' imprisonment on two counts (assault with an act of indecency); a term of four years on two counts (one buggery, one homosexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 18 years) and a term of five years' imprisonment on five counts (one buggery, three homosexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 18 years, one sexual intercourse without consent).

8The 20 charges on the various Forms 1 were attached to appropriate indictment counts. The offences were committed over a period of about 22 years between 1974 and 1996. At the time of commission of the offences, the respondent was aged between 24 and 45 years.

9I will later specify the statutory provisions against which the offences were committed but it needs to be observed that over the long period there were legislative changes that took effect. 

10By way of description, it can be said that the offences were historical in nature and therefore sentence assessment involved taking into account sentencing practice as at the date of offending: R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368. Further, prior to the Sentencing Act 1989, which took effect from September 1989, impositions of sentences of imprisonment attracted the operation of the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 under which a practice of setting the non-parole period was different from any statutory proportions legislated in 1989.

11Of course, it was not mandatory to apply the 1989 Act statutory formulation and the statute itself provided facility for departure from it. It is also noted that pursuant to the regime under the 1966 Act, remissions could be earned by a prisoner although such remissions were applicable only to head sentence and not to non-parole period.

12The offences committed by the respondent were all contrary to provisions in the Crimes Act 1900 as they existed from time to time. The section references which follow are all to provisions of that statute.

13The table hereunder shows the various provisions with the description of the offence in short form, together with the applicable prescribed maximum penalty.





61E(1) 

Indecent Assault

4 years' imprisonment


61I

Sexual intercourse without consent

14 years' imprisonment

Homosexual intercourse between 10 and 18 years

10 years' imprisonment


78Q

Act of gross indecency

2 years' imprisonment


79

Buggery

14 years' imprisonment


81

Indecent assault male 

5 years' imprisonment


81A

Commit act of indecency with male 

2 years' imprisonment

14Legislative changes should be noted. Sections 79 (buggery), 81 (indecent assault male) and 81A (commit act of indecency) were repealed on 8 June 1984 and replaced with charges under s 78. Section 78K (homosexual intercourse), which replaced the offence of buggery and 78Q (gross act of indecency), which replaced the offence of s 81 (Indecent assault male) commenced on that date. Section 61E(1) was introduced from 14 July 1981 and was repealed on 19 March 1991. On 17 March 1991, the offence of s 61I (sexual intercourse without consent) was introduced along with s 61M and 61O, aggravated indecent assault and aggravated act of indecency respectively.

15The Notice of Appeal advances four grounds, namely:
Ground 1: The sentencing Judge failed to reflect the principle of totality in the aggregate sentence.
Ground 2: The sentencing Judge erred in his approach to the offences of anal penetration.
Ground 3: The sentencing Judge erred in erroneously identifying the maximum penalty for count 19 as 2 years when it was 5 years.
Ground 4: The sentence is manifestly inadequate. 

16The sentencing proceedings were conducted upon the tender of an agreed statement of facts. These were lengthy, but it is necessary to recapitulate them as the detail therein reveals, with stark emphasis, the cumulative enormity of the respondent's crimes.

Count 1 - CS 
(Section 81 Crimes Act - indecent assault male)

3. CS was born in November 1961. His family all attended the Kurri Anglican Church. His mother and father had divorced, and his mother remarried.

4. In 1974, CS became an altar boy, which entailed him assisting the Minister during services.

5. CS was a member of the Youth Group. He recalled the group as being fun and active, with games nights and trips away. His first memory of the offender was in his capacity as Youth Group leader.

6. He recalled travelling in the car with the offender to the St Albans Boys Home to pick up PD, a young orphan who was a state ward and had been placed at the Boys Home. The car the offender owned was a burnt orange coloured Triumph.

7. On occasions in 1974 the offender invited CS to stay overnight with some other boys at a location in Morpeth, in a dormitory style room. There was minimal supervision and some of the boys smoked cigarettes. They all stayed there the night, then returned to the offender's home in Kurri the next day. There they played music; the offender had an expensive stereo system and played popular music. The offender offered wine to the children, and CS drank some and became intoxicated. He went to the bedroom and lay on the bed.

8. He woke through the night and found that the offender was in bed with him. The offender put his hands down the front of CS' pants and played with his penis and stroked it for a while. CS was still feeling intoxicated but told the offender to stop, and threatened to tell his parents.

9. This was between 24 December 1974 and 1 June 1975 when CS was 13 years old, and the offender was 24.

10. Some months later, the offender invited CS through his parents, to go away motorbike riding at Bathurst. CS was very interested in motorbikes at that time. They went to Bathurst, and the offender again offended against CS.

11. After that occasion, CS stopped going to Youth Group and did not go to the offender's house again.

Count 2 - PD
(Section 81 Crimes Act - indecent assault male)

12. PD was born in 1962. His adopted mother had died and he had been made a ward of the state and was placed at St Albans Boys Home, which was run by the Anglican Church. The offender offered to take PD for the 1975 August school holidays. PD accepted and this was allowed.

13. The offender picked PD up and returned to his home in Kurri. He told PD he only had one bed, and that PD would have to share that with him. He recalled the offender cuddling him at night.

14. During the evenings, the offender would drink, and provide to PD wine with dinner.

15. After one such evening, PD was woken through the night by the offender causing him to have an erection. The offender said, ""It's okay, me and Michael do this all the time."" Michael was the name of a priest known to PD. The offender removed PD's underpants and put his mouth over PD's penis and moved his head up and down. PD felt scared and did not know what was going to happen. The offender had moved around on the bed so his penis was near PD's head, and the offender was masturbating himself.

16. PD stopped the offender by saying he had to go to the toilet. He got back into bed, and moved as close as he could to the wall. Nothing further occurred that evening.

17. This happened most nights of the holidays.

18. This offence was between 1 August 1975 and 31 August 1975 when PD was 12 years old, and the offender was 25.

19. At the end of the holidays, the offender showed PD photographs of motorbikes and said he would have to get one for PD so they could go riding together.

20. This is a representative count with offences occurring until 1977.

21. In 1996, PD complained to police, and made a statement. Other evidence was compiled and on 16 September 1997 the offender was charged. The offender contested the matter and a committal hearing was directed, with PD giving evidence. On 29 July 1998 the matter was dismissed after evidence and the offender was discharged. That evidence included the details of the offence for which the offender now pleads guilty.

Count 3 - PH 
(Section 81 Crimes Act - indecent assault male)

22. PH was born in 1963 in Kurri and grew up there. His mother was a scripture teacher at Abermain Primary School. The family was involved with St Mary's Anglican Church in Weston and Abermain. The offender ran the Youth Group at St Mary's as well. They would all occasionally go to St Albans.

23. PH recalled thinking of the offender as someone he could trust. He recalled that he owned several cars, and would drive them on the speedway.

25. While at Bathurst they stayed at the offender's sister's house, sharing a bedroom and a double bed.

26. One evening PH woke feeling a hand on his penis. The offender was pressed up against him and had removed PH's penis from his pyjama pants. He masturbated PH until he ejaculated.

27. PH was too upset to go back to sleep, and was frightened and embarrassed.

29. PH stopped going to Youth Group after that event, and had no further association with the offender.

30. This offence was between 1 June 1976 and 30 June 1976 when PH was 14 years old and the offender was 26.

He remembered meeting PD during these times.

33. One evening, LW had arranged with his school friend to sleep over at his house. His friend's mother refused and LW felt stuck as he had already told his mother it was all right. LW and his friend went to the offender's house and it was agreed that LW would stay the night there.

34. That evening, LW had been drinking wine and watching pornographic movies with the offender. He was tired and the offender showed him to the bedroom and put another pornographic movie on, and sat on the floor. LW fell asleep.

35. Through the night LW woke up to feel the offender rubbing his penis and testicles. His pants had been opened. LW jumped up and demanded to know what the offender was doing. The offender said ""Sorry, I've never done anything like this before, don't tell anyone."" The offender left the room. LW remained frightened through the night, and blocked the door with a chair.

36. LW was too afraid to tell his parents. He never went back to the offender's house.

37. This offence occurred between 1 November 1977 and 20 December 1977 when LW was 13 years old, and the offender was 27.

Count 7 - RB 
(Section 81 Crimes Act - indecent assault male)
Plus Form 1 with 1 offence (Section 81A commit act of indecency with male)

Count 8 - RB 
(Section 79 Crimes Act - Buggery) 
Plus Form 1 with 3 offences (Section 81 indecent assault male x 2; Section 81A commit act of indecency with male)

54. RB was born 28 December 1965 at Kurri, and was raised in the area. He attended church with his grandfather, and in about 1974 became an altar boy. The offender was known to him as ""Brother Jim"".

55. RB attended the Youth Group run by the offender and remembered him at that time as ""the cool guy"", and the Youth Group activities were so much fun. RB attended camps away. On one occasion at camp, the offender found RB smoking. The usual consequence of that was to be immediately sent home and the parents informed. The offender took RB back to the dorm room office and made him wait for a while, and then told him he would not tell RB's parents, or take him home.

56. RB would visit the offender at this home, as did many other children. He recalled the offender owning a good stereo system and playing popular music.

57. During these times, the offender would touch RB on the genitals on the outside of his clothes. This would stop if someone else walked in. The offender would put his finger to his lips and say, ""Don't say anything."" This was between 1 December 1979 and 28 December 1979, and one of those occasions forms the basis for Offence 1 on the Form 1 being taken into account for Count 8. It is a representative count.

58. The offender allowed children including RB to smoke at his house, and told RB ""I won't say anything."" This continued over the course of the year.

59. In late 1980 RB was staying at the offender's house, and he slept in the offender's bed. The offender told him that all the boys did that, it was normal.

60. During the night RB was woken by the offender touching his penis. The offender told him it was all right and that as he had an erection it must have meant he was enjoying it. The offender moved down on the bed and performed fellatio on RB, until RB ejaculated. RB felt scared and ashamed. 

61. The offender asked him what he was worried about, and RB replied he was worried about his parents. The offender told him ""I understand but parents don't, ... don't normally understand this. That's why they couldn't know anything and why you can't tell your parents. Your parents won't respect you, they're older and won't understand and people go to gaol for these types of things."" RB interpreted that as if two males had sexual contact, they would both go to gaol.

62. The offender would take RB to Boat Harbour to stay. On one occasion the offender put KY jelly onto his penis. He took RB's hand and placed it over his (the offender's) penis, and masturbated until he ejaculated. The offender then performed fellatio on RB until he ejaculated. The fellatio offence is Count 7 for sentence, and the masturbation refers to Offence 1 on the Form 1 to be taken into account for Count 7 on the indictment. The offences occurred between 28 December 1979 and 28 December 1980 when RB was 14 and the offender 29 or 30.

63. The following year around Easter 1981, the offender again took RB away with him to Boat Harbour. One evening, the offender gave RB wine with dinner and more after others had left for the evening. The offender began to touch RB on his penis, and this evolved into mutual masturbation (Offence 2 on the Form 1 for Count 8). The offender asked RB to suck his penis and RB performed fellatio on the offender for a short time (Offence 3 on the Form 1 for Count 8). They lay down on the bed together, and the offender pushed his penis into RB's anus (Count 8 on the indictment). This was momentary, but caused RB severe pain. He got out of bed and went to the bathroom. He found he was not bleeding and felt immense relief; he thought that if he was bleeding he would need to go to hospital and his parents would find out. RB was 15 at the time of this offence and the offender was 31. 

64. RB did not go to see the offender for a while, although there was one later incident.

Count 9 - NH 
(Section 81 - indecent assault of male)
Plus Form 1 with 1 offence (Section 78Q - act of gross indecency)

65. NH was born on 10 March 1969, and his family moved to Kurri when he was young.

66. NH's family would have barbeques for work colleagues and friends, and it was at one of these gatherings that he met the offender. The offender became good friends with NH's father. The offender would offer money to NH to wash his car. 

67. One afternoon NH had come into the offender's house after washing his car. The offender walked over to him and put his hand on NH's genitals on the outside of his shorts, saying, ""Have you got big balls?"" This offence relates to Count 9 on the indictment. The offender removed his hand and walked away. This occurred between 1 January 1981 and 31 December 1981.

68. This is a representative count, with similar offences occurring over the course of that year.

69. NH recalled meeting another boy named JP at the offender's house, and they would go dune buggy riding with the offender. One occasion he also went to Bathurst with the offender.

70. Between 10 March 1986 and 10 March 1987, the offender took NH away to Boat Harbour with him. JP was also there. One morning the offender masturbated NH in bed. (This relates to Offence 1 on Form 1 being taken account on sentence for Count 9 on indictment). NH was around 17 years old at this time and the offender 36 or 37.

71. NH did not disclose this until he made his statement for this matter, and thought he was the only one this had happened to.

RM's mother recalled the offender was particularly kind to her during the break down of her marriage.

73. The offender at this time had a red dune buggy, lots of videos to watch on television and a spa. These were all things in which the child RM was interested.

74. One evening, RM stayed the night with the offender. This was between 1 January 1981 and 27 February 1982 when he was 11 years old.

114. The offender began to offend against JP when he was 11, before the time he was baptised. JP thought that was a natural part of their friendship. JP would stay nights at the offender's house, and he was very happy with the enjoyable things the offender would do with and for their family. At about his time JP's mother began a relationship with a man who was quite violent towards JP. He took any chance he had to leave the home and stay with the offender. When he stayed there, he shared the offender's bed. Usually they slept naked.

115. One occasion when JP was staying the night, the offender began a conversation with him about touching and how good it felt. The offender took JP's hand and put it around the offender's penis, and told JP to masturbate him. He gave him directions about faster or slower, and after a while the offender ejaculated. JP was not sure how he felt about that, except that he knew the offender was happy with him. This offence is Count 19 on indictment.

He also penetrated JP's anus with his penis, saying, ""Just relax and it will be easy and feel good."" He pushed his penis in and out of JP's anus, and JP felt a great deal of pain. (This is Count 22 on indictment). They got out of the spa, went into the offender's bedroom and lay down on the bed.

121. In 1988 the offender took 17 year old JP overseas to Singapore, and they shared a hotel room. The offender performed sexual acts with JP multiple times a day, including fellatio, masturbation and anal intercourse. Anal intercourse was always painful for JP, and the offender would vary the depth of his penetration depending on how JP was reacting to the pain. The offender caused JP to anally penetrate him and masturbate him at the same time. There was not much conversation during these activities, JP learned to simply follow the offender's lead.

122. The offender continued sexual contact with JP until he was 20 years old and moved away from the area. He always felt conflicted about the activity, as he loved the offender and did not want anything to interfere with his friendship with him.

154. That was the last offence PF recalls occurring with the offender. 

Ground 2
17The facility for imposing an aggregate sentence does not extinguish the obligation to assess criminality for individual sentences: Section 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; cf Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. Whilst an indicative sentence recorded in accordance with s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is not in itself amenable to appeal under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act, an erroneous approach in the indication of the sentence that would have been imposed for an individual offence may well reveal error in the aggregate sentence reached.

18Counts 13, 18, 22 and 27 each involved anal intercourse of a complainant by the respondent and they were allocated equivalent sentence indications of 5 years' imprisonment. The Crown submits that this result can be demonstrated to reveal an absence of requisite assessment of individual criminality. For this purpose, what was involved in each count should be recapitulated.

19Count 13 charged buggery of a victim aged about 8 or 9 years. The maximum penalty guide was 14 years' imprisonment. It is well established that the seriousness of an offence of this kind is elevated as the age of the child victim is younger; Shannon v R [2006] NSWCCA 39.

20Count 18 charged homosexual intercourse (anal penetration) when the complainant was 15 and the respondent 34. The maximum penalty prescription was 10 years' imprisonment. To be taken into account on a Form 1 were three further charges, two offences of homosexual intercourse (fellatio of the victim and causing the victim to anally penetrate the respondent) and indecent assault (masturbating the complainant).

21His Honour's remarks about this Count, namely:

Count 18 is clearly a charge of real gravity as it involved not only anal intercourse for a period but was done after the complainant had been badly affected by the ingestion of cannabis oil and was not in a position to look after himself. Further, the anal intercourse hurt him a great deal and made him cry. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years and this is clearly towards the upper end of the range, for matters of this type. This is particularly so, given the very serious matters on the Form 1.

make it difficult to perceive why, in respect of this count, an identical sentence assessment to other counts was made.

22Count 22 also alleged homosexual intercourse with the same maximum penalty. There were attached three offences of homosexual intercourse on a Form 1 (fellatio of the complainant on two occasions and one occasion of anal penetration). These offences occurred when the victim was aged between 13 and 16 and the respondent between 33 and 37. It needs to be observed, however, that Count 20, assault with an act of indecency (fellatio of the complainant) and Count 21, committing an act of indecency (causing the victim to fellate the respondent) occurred earlier than those offences when the same victim (JP) was aged 11 and the respondent aged 33.

23Count 27 charged sexual intercourse without consent, which had a prescribed maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. The conduct involved anal intercourse of the complainant and taken into account on a Form 1 was an offence of an aggravated act of indecency (mutual masturbation). The complainant was aged 16 and the respondent aged 43.

24In contrast with the equivalence of the indication in respect of these four counts, another count charging buggery (Count 8) was given an indicative term of 4 years, as against a 14 year maximum. Attached to it was a Form 1 requiring taking into account indecent assault (touching of the complainant's penis through his clothing) and committing an act of indecency (fellatio of the respondent). The complainant was aged 15 and the respondent aged 31.

25It is not possible to deduce from the remarks on sentence a process of reasoning whereby a conclusion can be reached that the factors applicable to sentence assessment in all the counts resulted in the exact indicated assessment of 5 years nor is the difficulty reduced by the reduction of the indication in relation to Count 8.

26There is substance in the Crown's submission that what seems to have been applied is a ""blanket"" assessment. Putting to one side for the moment whether 5 years itself (or 4 years) is shown to be inadequate, the variations in the criminality, which are obviously apparent in the elements constituting the crimes for which sentence needed to be assessed, do not lead to a conclusion that individual criminality has been assessed.

27I would uphold this ground.

Ground 3
28This ground complains of a specific error when his Honour dealt with Count 19, which was a charge that the respondent assaulted JP and at the time committed an act of indecency upon him contrary to section 81 of the Crimes Act. The offence occurred between January and June 1983 when the complainant was aged 11 and the respondent aged 33. The facts have been already described. 

29In his remarks, his Honour referred to the offence simply as ""indecent assault"" and expressed the maximum penalty available as 2 years' imprisonment. In fact, as the table which I have set out shows, the maximum penalty was 5 years' imprisonment, a 2 year term being applicable to a charge contrary to s 81A. The source of the error was obviously a misstatement in an annotated indictment supplied by the Crown which mistakenly noted a 2 year term as applicable.

30Given the relative ages of the respondent and the victim and the misconduct involved, an assessment using a maximum penalty of 2 years as a guide would have been inevitably infected by the error. Upholding this ground does not call for an isolated order affecting Count 19 but the error contributes an element to determination of whether the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate and, if so, what re-sentence should be applied.

31It is convenient to note a response by senior counsel for the respondent in his observation that it could be contended that the assessment in relation to Count 26 was excessive by reason of the failure to advert to the circumstance that, although homosexual intercourse between the respondent and the victim took place in December 1993 when they were aged respectively 43 and 17, and it was then a punishable offence, it had ceased to be so following legislation in 2003. Thus it was contended there was a strong basis for an argument by analogy that sentence for the offence should be mitigated. However, it was candidly and properly conceded that it was not suggested that such an error had impacted in any meaningful way on his Honour's ultimate exercise of sentencing discretion.

32In fact, in articulating the indicative sentences, a term of 5 years was specified for all of the offences of buggery or homosexual intercourse with a minor, with two exceptions. One of these was Count 26 and the indicative term of 4 years may, although his Honour made no statement about it, be explained by the age factor and the legislative change adverted to by counsel. Count 26 could also, of course, be discriminated on the basis that the intercourse involved fellatio and not anal penetration. The second exception, also attached to a 4 year indicative term, again although not stated, may have reflected his Honour's view about what he described as the momentary penetration which, nevertheless, had caused severe pain. 

33I am unpersuaded that an error of the kind postulated by counsel in regard to Count 26 has been shown to have infected the sentence assessment adversely to the respondent. I add the comment that there were, as above mentioned, five further offences of homosexual intercourse with a minor taken into account on a Form 1 attached to Count 18, which was one of those included in the group to which an indication of 5 years' imprisonment was expressed. 

Grounds 1 and 4
34These grounds can be conveniently dealt with together.

35His Honour expressly accepted a Crown submission that there should be ""partial accumulation"". Except that there is no single term of sentence indication larger than 5 years and that the aggregate sentence imposed was 10 years (with a six year non parole period), there is no exposure of how that finding was applied. Of course, in the exercise of power to impose an aggregate sentence, accumulation would in a sense be notional but an examination of the potentials for accumulation can cast light upon whether the aggregate sentence represents a sound exercise of sentencing discretion.

36Within ""groups"" of counts for which sentence indication was given (variously 5 years, 4 years, 3 years, 2 years 6 months, 2 years and 1 year) it does not appear that there has been cumulation but the sentence indication for each offence would appear to assume concurrency. Neither does it appear that there has been accumulation in respect of the indicated sentences grouped within each other. I have said ""appear"" in the absence of any precise expression, one way or another, but I do not overlook that there must have been some application of notional accumulation in order to specify the aggregate sentence of 10 years as compared with the largest indication of 5 years.

37The issue on these grounds is whether a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years has failed to reflect the totality of the criminality involved and consequently has been shown to be manifestly inadequate.

38The high level of criminality in the respondent's conduct is not only obvious in the commission of very many serious offences over a very long period of time but in the circumstance, pointed to by the Crown prosecutor, that the respondent constantly found new victims. When he found them, he accompanied his behaviour with the accoutrements of the experienced sexual predator, showing his victims pornographic films and plying them on occasions with alcohol and drugs. One such instance involved giving champagne to an 8 or 9 year old boy.

39The aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offending over 22 years upon 20 victims. To avoid repetition, I state that that conclusion is not undermined by any subjective factors upon which the respondent might have drawn, which I will refer to in relation to re-sentence.

40Grounds 1 and 4 should be upheld.

Re-sentence
41It is not contended that the sentencing judge failed to give account to any favourable matter upon which the respondent could seek to rely in mitigation of sentence.

42There was some controversy about whether the charges against the respondent of the offences against PD in 1995 had, as his Honour put it, ""the effect of stopping him from continuing with his abuse of children"". As observed, the respondent has now pleaded guilty to the offences against PD. The respondent's evidence at the hearing in the District Court revealed that he was discharged on committal because PD, whose complaint was being challenged, refused to return to the witness stand and the prosecution for that reason collapsed. Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the cessation of offending, irrespective of the cause, ""takes out the need for specific deterrence"". If that were meant literally I would reject the proposition but I accept that it is a factor which would weigh in considering predictions of the risk of future offending. The fact that the respondent ceased offending does not of itself mitigate the seriousness of the crimes that he did commit. The fact that there is a gap of time between last offence and imposition of sentence does not extinguish the need for an element of deterrence.

43Although the cessation of the prosecution in relation to the complaints of PD terminated as I have recounted, in his evidence the respondent said that his reason for desisting from further offence was the fear of imprisonment. Tendered on behalf of the respondent was a psychiatric report from Dr Bruce Westmore who expressed the opinion that the respondent was not of paedophilic orientation although he said the term hebephilia is sometimes applied to persons of the respondent's sexual orientation, meaning a focus on teenagers rather than prepubescent children. As already noted, however, not all of the victims were teenagers, some were younger than that. It would seem therefore that the respondent's capacity to cease offending showed that, undriven by some uncontrollable psychosexual urges, he engaged in his depredations of the youthful victims purely for his own gratification.

44The respondent was born on 12 January 1950 and grew up in the Kurri Kurri area. He became active in the local Anglican Church where he assisted in the Youth Group and also at a nearby boys' home. Findings by his Honour which were not challenged included that the respondent had no prior convictions, was not in the high risk of re-offending, had only some belated contrition and remorse but had engaged in some systematic planning and organisation for his offending. As already observed, the offending was facilitated by the use of the commonly used accoutrements of the sexual predator. His Honour took into account the delay in the offences coming to light (save the complaint by PD) the result of which has been some elapse of time between last offending and sentence. The pleas of guilty were appropriately recognised and taken into account.

45No complaint is made about the use made by his Honour of the content of the Victim Impact Statements in that the Crown did not challenge his finding that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that damage to victims was substantial. The basis of the finding was stated to be the unsworn and untested nature of the content of the statements. Although the finding was not challenged, that does not mean that the effects on the multiple victims are to be ignored. Statements were received from 11 victims and his Honour's comments were:

It is quite clear from these sometimes eloquent and all heartfelt statements, that the criminal actions of this offender, although ranging from 1974 and ending in 1995, have continued to affect these young men. Throughout there is the betrayal of trust, deeply ingrained feelings of disgust and low self-esteem and constant difficulties in managing personal and family relationships. Some of the victims were not believed by their parents. Others turned to alcohol, drugs and even serious crime. Many felt the need to be over vigilant with their own families and reading them exemplifies why the law treats sexual assault against children so seriously. 

46It does not require proof of the content of the statements of victims beyond reasonable doubt to conclude that, on any view, the respondent would have left in the wake of his crimes, a trail of wreckage constituted by the harm and damage to his many victims. 

47His Honour was alert to what is conventionally described as the historical nature of the offences which requires taking into account established sentencing pattern applicable at the time of offending: AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51; (2007) 169 A Crim R 32. The same will apply to any re-sentence. For the reasons which his Honour recorded, I would, if re-sentencing, also divide any total term so that the proportion of non-parole period is equivalent to 60 per cent of that total.

48The Crown has submitted that an adequate sentence reflecting all factors would be a head sentence of at least 20 years. Application of the same proportion as that chosen by his Honour to such a term would result in a non-parole period of 12 years. In apparent anticipation of that possible outcome, the respondent relied upon the affidavit of Ms Rostron, solicitor, in which she deposed that inquiries had revealed that should the respondent's non-parole period be 12 years or greater, he would be classified as a serious offender and held in a maximum security prison. He is presently classified B and held in medium security. In response to further inquiries made by the Crown, correspondence was exhibited to the affidavit of Ms Winston. That correspondence is expressed to be clarification of information provided to Ms Rostron. I extract therefrom:

It should be noted that after his appeal, should his sentence vary, his classification will be determined by a manager, classification and placement, and the Serious Offenders Review Council will be informed should it be 12 years or greater.

The Serious Offenders Review Council provides advice to the Commissioner on a serious offender's classification, placement and case plan. It is the Commissioner who determines the outcome. The previous Commissioner of Corrective Services NSW developed guidelines for progression in classification for serious offenders. These were guidelines only and the former Commissioner at times progressed serious offenders outside these guidelines. At this time it is not known if the newly appointed Commissioner of Corrective Services will maintain these guidelines. It is noted under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 and Regulation 2008 there is no restrictions [sic] in terms of time left to serve for progression in classification. 

49On the information provided, I am unable to conclude that it has been shown that, if a non-parole period of 12 years or more is the outcome of re-sentence, the respondent would probably be confined in harsher circumstances so as to attract mitigation of sentence on that account. 

50The aggregate sentence imposed in the District Court significantly failed to reflect the seriousness of the respondent's multiple offences against many victims over a very long period of time. Neither did it adequately reflect the circumstances in which the crimes were committed in particular in the constant acquisition of new victims, the exposure of young people at impressionable ages to pornographic material and, from time to time, plying them with alcohol and drugs all to enable the respondent to experience forms of sexual gratification.

51I recognise that in assessing re-sentence it is necessary to apply the considerations above mentioned which require regard when offences of an historical nature are in focus. Nevertheless in my view in the whole of the circumstances, and acknowledging the restraint which attaches to re-sentence after a successful Crown appeal, I would assess an appropriate sentence to be a non-parole period of 12 years with a balance of term of 8 years. It is appropriate to make orders only in respect of the aggregate sentence. This is consistent with the faculty granted by s 53A and, it can be mentioned, the intention expressed when the provision was being legislated in the second reading speech where it was observed that it would as a result of the amendment ""make it easier to adjust an overall sentence when one sentence is changed on appeal.""

52I would make the following orders:
1) Crown appeal allowed.
2) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed.
3) In lieu thereof, the respondent sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 24 November 2011 and expiring on 23 November 2023 together with a balance term of 8 years commencing on 24 November 2023. 
4) The earliest date of eligibility for parole specified as 23 November 2023.

2760111,O'Sullivan v R; Flanders v R; Tohu v R & NRH v R [2012] NSWCCA 45,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: In these appeals I agree with the orders proposed by Davies and Garling JJ.

2I agree, for the reasons they give, that the appeal by NRH on the ground that the verdict in respect of him was unreasonable should be upheld. I also agree with their Honours in relation to the fresh evidence grounds of appeal. I prefer to express my own reasons in relation to section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is unnecessary for me to resolve the other grounds and I express no view about them. 

O'Sullivan Ground 2 and Flanders Ground 8: The following evidence was wrongly excluded under s 293(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986:
During the incident the applicant [O'Sullivan] said to the complainant ""I didn't know you were like this"" to which the complainant replied ""I'm full of surprises"". 

3At the first trial an application was made by counsel for O'Sullivan to adduce evidence of a verbal exchange that took place between O'Sullivan and the complainant during the events occasioning the charges. On O'Sullivan's account, he said to the complainant:

""I didn't know that you were like this.""

4The complainant allegedly replied by saying:

""I'm full of surprises.""

5The precise timing of the exchange is not clear. However, I infer that it is alleged that the exchange occurred in the bedroom, while the four men were present and prior to Tohu engaging in oral sex with the complainant.

6The admissibility of evidence relating to the sexual experience and reputation of a complainant in proceedings relating to sexual offences is governed by s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 293 provides that: 

""293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 

(1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 

(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 

(3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 

(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 

(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, 

is inadmissible. 
(4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 

(a) if the evidence: 

(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 

(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 

(b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 

...""

7The provisions contained in s 293 were originally introduced in 1981 as s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900 by the Crimes (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act 1981. The Crimes (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act was the culmination of a long process of law reform and contained a number of significant provisions affecting the prosecution of sexual assault offences. The purpose and intended operation of the legislation generally, and s 409B in particular, were clearly articulated in the second reading speech. When the Bill was introduced to the Parliament, the then Premier, the Hon. Neville Wran said:

""The object of the principal bill...is to remedy major defects in the law relating to rape and sexual assault. These reforms are designed to protect the victims of rape from further victimisation under the legal process; to encourage rape victims to report offences to the authorities; to facilitate the administration of justice and the conviction of guilty offenders; at the same time, to preserve the rights of the accused; and to serve an educative function in further changing community attitudes to sexual assault."" (NSW, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 18 March 1981). 

8The Premier then commented on the purpose of s 409B. He said: 

""...the bill will prohibit irrelevant questioning of sexual assault victims about their prior sexual behaviour. This provision is based upon the premise that a person who seeks sexual intercourse with another should not be able to rely on scandal and gossip about the other person or on rumour or knowledge of the other person's sexual behaviour with others, as a basis for assuming consent to intercourse. The law should not - and under this legislation will not - allow the accused to subject the victim of the sexual assault to humiliation and irrelevant questioning about details of previous sexual conduct and attitudes. At the present time many victims believe that the humiliation they would face as a witness in court outweighs all other considerations. I have every confidence that the provision will play a significant part in encouraging victims to report offences, and to ensure that such victims will be treated justly and humanely by the judicial system."" (NSW, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 18 March 1981).

9The purpose of s 409B was also discussed in plain terms in the introduction to a contemporaneous publication released by the NSW Department of the Attorney General entitled Sexual assault law reform in New South Wales: a commentary on the Crimes (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act 1981:

""The most important practical effect of the new legislation relates to limitation of cross-examination and material bearing upon prior sexual behaviour...Whereas in the past a standard type defence in a rape case has been for the accused to make an unsworn statement from the dock alleging his belief that the complainant was promiscuous, that she slept with virtually anyone and that she was reputed to be a ""slut"" or a ""lowey"" (to use the colloquial style of language often employed by many rape defendant), such tactics will now be prohibited. The accused may allege that he honestly believed the complainant consented, but he may not do so merely on the basis of rumour or gossip about the complainant."" (Dr G. D. Woods, Sexual Assault Law Reforms in New South Wales, NSW Department of the Attorney General and of Justice, 1981).

10The application to admit evidence of the exchange was first made at the trial before Phegan ADCJ relying upon to s 293(4)(a)(i) and (ii). It was submitted that evidence of the exchange constituted ""evidence relating to the sexual experience"" of the complainant and was therefore subject to exclusion under s 293(3). Phegan ADCJ rejected that categorisation of the evidence, ruling that the exchange constituted evidence relating to the applicant's sexual reputation and therefore fell within s 293(2). As no exceptions apply to the operation of s 293(2), the evidence was ruled inadmissible. 

11At the second trial the parties agreed to be bound by the decision of Phegan ADCJ. The correctness of that decision was challenged on appeal. 

12The Crown submitted, both at the trial and on the appeal, that the exchange involved the expression of O'Sullivan's belief about the sexual reputation of the complainant. The Crown submitted that the comment was made at a time when it was plain that the complainant was about to engage in sexual intercourse with multiple men, and when viewed in this context the remark amounted to O'Sullivan saying that:

""Given what I know about your sexual reputation, I didn't know that you were the type of girl that would have sex with multiple men."" 

13The Crown submitted that the comment clearly related to the complainant's sexual reputation and was correctly excluded by the first trial judge. 

14On appeal, it was submitted on behalf of O'Sullivan that the evidence of the relevant exchange was not ""evidence relating to"" the sexual reputation of the complainant within the proper meaning of that term. The ground of appeal was also relied upon by Flanders.

15The approach to be taken to the construction of the term ""relating to"" has been discussed in many cases. It is not without difficulty. In Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (1961) 105 CLR 602 Taylor J said at 620:

""...the expression... is extremely wide but it is also vague and indefinite. Clearly enough it predicates the existence of some kind of relationship but it leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is to be sought and identified. That being so, all that a court can do is to endeavour to seek some precision in the context in which the expression is used."" 

16In Taylor v R [2009] NSWCCA 180 Campbell JA, with whom Latham and Harrison JJ agreed, considered the role of context in the construction of the expression. His Honour said at [41] and [42]: 

""there is ample judicial authority concerning the approach to be taken to a construction of the words ""relating to"" in a statute. For example in Joye v Beach Petroleum NL (1996) 67 FCR 275 at 285 Beaumont and Lehane JJ said:

...Other decisions of the High Court have acknowledged that, ordinarily, 'relates to' is a wide term, and that it will depend upon context whether it is necessary that the relationship be direct or substantial, or whether an indirect or less than substantial connection will suffice (see Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner (1995) 183 CLR 323 at 338 per Brennan J, at 347 per Dawson J, at 354 per Toohey J and at 370 per McHugh J; PMT Partners Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Australian National Parks & Wildlife Service (1995) 69 ALJR 829 at 835-836 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ and at 845-846 per Toohey and Gummow JJ; Re Jarman; Ex parte Cook (1996) 70 ALJR 550 at 553 per Brennan CJ and Gaudron J and at 556 per Kirby J. Tooheys' case has been followed in this Court (see, eg, Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell (1992) 36 FCR 367 at 374 per Hill J and at 383 per Cooper J).

Similarly, in Oceanic Life Ltd v Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties [1999] NSWCA 416; (1999) 168 ALR 211; 154 FLR 129 at [56], Fitzgerald JA said:

[56] The width of the phrase 'relating to' is undoubted. Lord Macnaghten stated that '[t]here is no expression more general or far-reaching': Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Maple & Co (Paris) Ltd [1908] AC 22 at 26. Fountain v Alexander (1982) 150 CLR 615 at 629; 40 ALR 441; Colakovski v Australian Telecommunications Corporation [(1991) 29 FCR 429]; Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell [(1992) 36 FCR 367]; PMT Partners Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service [(1995) 184 CLR 301 at 329-330], although the addition of the words 'or depending on' was presumably intended to give the combined phrase 'relating to or depending on' a wider operation than 'relating to'. The difficulties of construction presented by such language have also been noted. Taylor J observed that '...the expression ""relating to"" ...is ... vague and indefinite...' and ""... leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is [to be] sought and identified': Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620. One area of debate has been whether, in particular legislation, a relationship need or need not be 'direct' or 'direct and immediate': see, for example, Ausfield Pty Ltd v Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia Ltd (No 2) (1977) 14 ALR 457 at 460, 462; [30 FLR 477 at 480, 483]; Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 364 and 370]; Joye v Beach Petroleum NL [(1996) 67 FCR 275 at 285]; see also Perlman v Perlman [(1984) 155 CLR 474]. Overall, the position judicially adopted has been that the operation of the phrase 'relating to' is determined by the statutory context and purpose: Butler v Johnston [(1984) 4 FCR 83 at 87]; Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487 at 491.""

17The construction that should be given to the term ""evidence relating to"" in s 293 was considered by the High Court in obiter dicta in Bull v The Queen [2000] HCA 24; (2000) 201 CLR 443. In that case the issue before the Court was the correct construction of s 36BA of the Evidence Act 1906 (WA). Section 36BA provides that:

""In proceedings for a sexual offence, evidence relating to the disposition of the complainant in sexual matters shall not be adduced or elicited by or on behalf of the defendant.""

18While ""disposition"" is not a category referred to in the New South Wales provision, the Court gave detailed consideration to the meaning of the phrase ""evidence relating to"". In the majority judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, their Honours referred to what they considered to be the correct interpretation of that phrase in the context of the New South Wales provisions currently under consideration. Their Honours said at [89] - [92]:

""Also militating against the correctness of the first construction is the fact that the Western Australian Parliament used the words ""evidence relating to"" instead of the words ""evidence disclosing or implying"". In New South Wales, s 409B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, [now s [293] of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)], which was in force at the time the 1985 Western Australian amendments were enacted, provided that ""evidence which discloses or implies that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience"" was inadmissible except on certain conditions. In his commentary on what was then s 409B(3) of the Crimes Act [now s 293(3)] Dr G D Woods QC stated:

""Note that the evidence need only 'disclose or imply' sexual experience or sexual activity to fall within the prohibition. It is immaterial that such disclosure or implication might be unintentional or merely incidental."" 

In contrast, the then s 409B(2) [now 293(2)] of the Crimes Act used the same ""evidence relating to"" formula as appears in s 36B of the Act:

""In prescribed sexual offence proceedings, evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible.""

Of this provision, Dr G D Woods QC stated:

""This is an important provision, excluding irrelevant material about a complainant's supposed sexual behaviour as a proper basis upon which the facts of a particular allegation of sexual assault should be judged.""

The reference to ""a proper basis"" suggests that the purpose for which the evidence is adduced may be important.

19Their Honours ultimate conclusion, which is of relevance to the present case, was expressed in the following terms at [93]: 

""The juxtaposition in the New South Wales legislation of ""evidence relating to"" and ""evidence which discloses or implies"" indicates that the Parliament of that State intended ""evidence relating to"" a certain fact to mean ""evidence adduced for the purpose of proving"" that fact."" 

20The majority judgment also considered the nature of evidence that would constitute ""evidence adduced for the purpose of proving"" a particular fact. Their Honours said at [73]: 

""On the assumption that the words ""evidence relating to"" are confined to testimony that tends to prove reputation, disposition or experiences, one needs also to bear in mind that testimony relating to conduct and testimony relating to out-of-court statements stand in different positions. As we have pointed out, testimony relating to conduct may have the tendency to prove disposition, even though it has the tendency to prove a fact in issue. Because that is so, the plain language of s 36BA prima facie prohibits all testimony relating to conduct that tends to prove the disposition of the complainant in sexual matters, even if the evidence is relevant and is tendered only for some other purpose. However, testimony relating to out-of-court statements is much less likely to tend to prove such matters. Independently of ss 36B, 36BA and 36BC of the Act, testimony concerning out-of-court statements by or in the presence of the complainant will only be admissible in limited circumstances. Because the complainant is not a party to the proceedings, testimony on behalf of the accused concerning such statements will be admissible to prove a fact asserted in the statement only if it comes within a recognised exception to the hearsay rule. The hearsay rule, and not ss 36B, 36BA or 36BC, will ordinarily prohibit the admission of such testimony. In the present case, for example, assuming that evidence of the telephone conversation was admissible, it nevertheless had no probative value in respect of any of the matters asserted in the statements except to the extent that they could be used as admissions against Bull.

At common law, the out-of-court statements of a complainant relating to that person's sexual reputation, disposition or experiences could not be adduced as evidence of the facts therein contained, whether evidence of the making of the statements was sought to be adduced in cross-examination or otherwise. They were excluded by the hearsay rule unless they fell within a recognised exception to that rule. Of course, if admissions could be obtained from the complainant as to the facts in such statements, they could be used to prove any fact in issue and the character and credibility of the complainant. No doubt the contents of the statements might be put to the complainant for various forensic purposes, but in principle proof that the complainant had made the statements would not prove their contents.

Sometimes, however, testimony of an out-of-court statement is admissible to prove a fact relevant to a fact in issue such as the intention or purpose of the complainant or even the consent of the complainant. If the statement contains material that refers to matters relating to the reputation, disposition or experiences of the complainant in sexual matters, would it be evidence tending to prove those matters and prohibited by one or more of the three sections? We think not."" (emphasis added)

21To my mind, the exchange between O'Sullivan and the complainant cannot be relevantly characterised as ""evidence relating to"" the complainant's sexual reputation. It consists of an out of court statement which, although it refers to the sexual reputation of the complainant, for the reasons set out by McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Bull, is not evidence tending to prove that reputation. The conversation was directly related to a fact in issue, namely the complainant's consent at the time of sexual activity. If accepted by the jury, the evidence was in essence an inquiry by O'Sullivan and confirmation from the complainant that she was consenting to group sex at a time when it was apparent that an activity of that nature was about to take place. The jury was not being invited to reason to a conclusion about whether the complainant consented or whether O'Sullivan believed that she consented based upon the complainant's reputation as a person likely (or not likely) to partake in sexual activities with multiple partners. 

22In light of this conclusion the question of whether the conversation is evidence that ""discloses or implies"" sexual experience must also be considered. In my opinion the evidence, particularly the complainant's alleged response to the applicant's statement, clearly implies that the complainant may have had sexual experience. However, the evidence is of events alleged to have taken place in the complainant's bedroom immediately prior to the alleged sexual assault. The evidence is therefore admissible pursuant to s 293(4)(a)(ii), which allows ""evidence of events that are alleged to form a part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed"". 

23I would uphold this ground of appeal. 

24DAVIES and GARLING JJ: The four Appellants appeared for trial at Gosford District Court on 19 April 2010 before King DCJ and a jury to answer an indictment containing seven counts relating to events which occurred on 12 January 2008.

25Count 1 related to the Appellant Flanders only, alleging that he had committed an indecent assault upon the Complainant JS by kissing her on the breast in the kitchen area of her house before the other incidents occurred. Counts 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 charged all four Appellants with five counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent upon JS, the circumstance of aggravation in each case being that they were in company. Count 5 charged all four Appellants with an attempt to commit aggravated sexual intercourse without consent upon JS, the circumstance of aggravation being again that they were in company. In relation to Count 6 the Crown was unable to identify the principal offender.

26To enable an adequate understanding of the factual situation the following table indicates in relation to each of the counts 2-7 who the principal offender was alleged to be together with the sexual activity involved.

27On 10 May 2010 the jury returned verdicts of guilty against Flanders in respect of count 1 and against all Appellants on counts 3, 4 and 5. Each of the Appellants was acquitted on counts 2, 6 and 7. Each Appellant has appealed against his convictions. Tohu's appeal was filed out of time but, there being no opposition from the Crown, the time will be extended to permit him to appeal.

Background to the trial

28The first trial of the Appellants took place before his Honour Acting Judge Phegan and a jury of twelve in September 2009. The evidence proceeded for five days during which time the Complainant gave evidence and was cross-examined by counsel for the all of the Appellants. There was no re-examination.

29That trial then proceeded until a point during the cross-examination of the Appellant O'Sullivan when the jury was discharged.

30The trial in respect of which the appeals are brought commenced before Judge King SC on 19 April 2010. The evidence of the Complainant in its entirety was played to the jury from the recording of her evidence made at the first trial. There had been some technical difficulties at the time of that recording which resulted in a substantial portion of her evidence being recorded by audio means only. However nothing turns on that from the perspective of the present appeals. 

31At the first trial counsel for O'Sullivan made an application under s 293 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to cross-examine the Complainant and lead evidence about particular matters. One of these matters concerned an exchange between O'Sullivan and the Complainant whilst they were engaged in sexual activity. O'Sullivan said to the Complainant, ""I didn't know you were like this"" to which the Complainant replied ""I'm full of surprises"". 

32Phegan ADCJ ruled evidence of that conversation was inadmissible on the basis that it was a comment on her reputation. The parties at the second trial before King DCJ agreed to be bound by the decision of Phegan ADCJ pursuant to s 130A Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

The facts

33The Complainant and the Appellant O'Sullivan had known one another since the end of 2006 or early 2007. She had worked casually at the Woy Woy Youth Centre where O'Sullivan worked full time. The Complainant had never met any of the other three Appellants before the night in question. 

34Whilst both the Complainant and O'Sullivan were at the Woy Woy Bowling Club on 10 January 2008 they had a conversation where each mentioned that the other had broken up with their respective partners. The Complainant gave O'Sullivan her telephone number at this time.

35Thereafter on that night and on the following day the Complainant and O'Sullivan exchanged both telephone and text messages. Some of the text messages were of an explicitly sexual nature and suggested that a sexual encounter might occur between the Complainant and O'Sullivan on the night of 11 January 2008.

36There was a factual dispute about whether the Complainant indicated to O'Sullivan that she was interested in having a threesome with O'Sullivan and another person. The Complainant denied that she ever intimated that she wanted to have such a threesome. On the other hand O'Sullivan gave evidence that in one call the Complainant had asked O'Sullivan if he was interested in a threesome. O'Sullivan also gave evidence that a little after discussing a threesome with Flanders he rang the Complainant to see if she was really interested in a threesome and the Complainant said that she was. Both O'Sullivan and Flanders gave evidence that this conversation was heard by both of them because O'Sullivan's phone was on loud speaker at the time. 

37What was undisputed was that the communications between the Complainant and O'Sullivan culminated in his requesting her to pick him up from The Webb at about 2:07am on 12 January 2008. The Webb was a youth centre on the corner of McMasters and Ocean Beach Roads, Woy Woy. That Centre was only a short distance from the Complainant's home. The message also asked if she would drop O'Sullivan's brother and his best mate off somewhere. 

38The Complainant drove to The Webb. O'Sullivan was there with Tohu whom he introduced as his best mate and NRH whom he introduced as his brother. O'Sullivan told the Complainant that he had to go and see another mate, and he asked her to take his brother and best mate (NRH and Tohu) back to her home. He said that he would not be long and would be there in about five minutes. The Complainant pointed out the location of her home to O'Sullivan.

39The Complainant then drove Tohu and NRH to her home which was a small granny flat. She gave NRH a bottle of German beer and Tohu a bourbon and coke. A short time later O'Sullivan arrived at the premises with Flanders. O'Sullivan introduced him as his younger brother. The Complainant offered O'Sullivan and Flanders drinks. 

40When they were standing in the kitchen O'Sullivan put him arms around her waist. According to the Complainant Flanders then pulled the right side of her top down, exposing her breast. He said ""great tit"" and put his mouth on her breast. 

41Flanders' evidence was that the complainant herself exposed her breast and smiled at him when she did it. He agreed that he put his mouth on her breast. That was the basis of Count 1 charged against Flanders.

42The Complainant then alleged that O'Sullivan let her go and went into the bedroom. He went towards the bedside table where she kept her sex toys. She said that she went after him and dived across the bed to try to stop him. She rolled over on the bed and said at that stage that the four Appellants were in the bedroom. Someone referred to getting her pants off her and O'Sullivan and Flanders proceeded to do that. The Complainant said that at that point she froze, she felt numb and frightened and had no control over what was happening. 

43She said that NRH then straddled her and placed his penis inside her vagina. That was the basis for Count 2 in the indictment. NRH denied this assertion of the Complainant. In fact, NRH claimed that he did not participate in any sexual activity with the Complainant. Rather, he said that he simply entered the bedroom to ""stickybeak"" on what was going on. All the Appellants gave evidence that NRH did not take part in the sexual activity. The jury did not convict on Count 2.

44At the same time, O'Sullivan was beside her with his fly undone and his penis out. Flanders had his hand on the back of her head. He pushed it towards O'Sullivan's penis and she was forced to have oral sex with him. That was the basis of Count 3. O'Sullivan agreed that oral sex took place between the Complainant and him but said that he did not force her to do so. The jury convicted on Count 3.

45Thereafter the Complainant said that Flanders was on top of her and Tohu had his hand on the back of her head, forcing her to perform oral sex on him. She said he ejaculated into her mouth. That was the basis of Count 4. Tohu agreed that he engaged in oral sex as described with the Complainant but said that he did so after O'Sullivan said to him, ""She gives good head, get your dick sucked."" The jury convicted on Count 4.

46The Complainant said that Flanders was on top of her but was having difficulty getting his penis into her vagina. He said ""what the fuck is going on, I can't get it in"". That formed the basis for Count 5 of attempting intercourse. Flanders denied that he attempted to have sexual intercourse with the Complainant. He agreed that when he unzipped his pants, thinking that he may engage in some sexual activity with the Complainant, his penis was soft and he could not get aroused. The jury convicted on Count 5.

47The Complainant said that there was then talk of lubrication and anal penetration with a vibrator which had been retrieved from the bedside table. She said that she then felt a sharp pain in her anal area but did not know if it was from the vibrator or from a penis. That formed the basis for Count 6. All the appellants denied any form of anal intercourse including with the vibrator. The jury did not convict on Count 6.

48Thereafter the Complainant said that Flanders had his penis inside her vagina and was moving backwards and forwards. That formed the basis for Count 7. Flanders denied that he engaged in any form of intercourse with the Complainant. The jury did not convict on Count 7.

49The Complainant said that when Flanders stopped having penile vaginal intercourse with her, she was told to get on her knees. She said that at that point she ""lost it"" and started yelling at them all to leave her alone. She said ""fuck off, get out of here, just fuck off"". Tohu, Flanders and NRH then left the room but O'Sullivan remained. 

50The Complainant said that when the three males had left the room, she found something to cover herself with. O'Sullivan started walking up and down saying ""what the fuck have I done, what the fuck have I done"". He said, ""I didn't mean for this to happen"" and ""I'm sorry"". He also said, ""if you have to dob, don't dob the others in, just dob me in"" and ""I'm not fucking going to jail"". 

51The Complainant then told him to ""fuck off"" and to leave. She then went into the bathroom, closed the door and put a cane basket against it. She said she could hear him asking what he could do to fix it and asking her if she wanted money. She then got into the shower and she did not hear from him again.

52When she got out of the shower she rang her friend Michelle Jackson. Ms Jackson and another friend, Catherine Poyner, came around to the Complainant's place within minutes. They contacted two other friends, Michael Dwyer and Amanda Stubbs, who also attended her premises. 

53The Complainant was persuaded by Michael Dwyer to ring the police. Eventually she did so, the police arrived and she was taken to Gosford Hospital.

54O'Sullivan, Tohu and Flanders all gave evidence that they believed the Complainant was consenting to the sexual activity either because they had been led to believe she was interested in a threesome or because of her behaviour at her house or for both reasons.
55The Appellants have appealed on the following grounds. 

O'Sullivan

56Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at the trial of fresh evidence.

57Ground 2: The following evidence was wrongly excluded on the basis that it offended against s 293(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986:

During the incident the Accused said to the Complainant "" didn't know you were like this"" to which the Complainant replied ""I'm full of surprises"". 

58Ground 3: The Trial Judge erred in his direction to the jury as to what constituted reasonable grounds for a belief in consent. 

59Ground 4: In relation to Count 5, the Trial Judge erred in directing the jury on the law of consent in accordance with s 61HA.

60Ground 5: The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 

Flanders

61Ground 1(a): The Trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to what in law constituted reasonable grounds for a belief in consent for the purposes of s 61HA Crimes Act.

62Ground 1(b): The Trial Judge erred in failing to direct and explain to the jury that reasonable grounds for the purposes of s 61HA Crimes Act was not a reasonable person test.

63Ground 2: The Trial Judge erred in failing to advert at any point in the summing up to the evidence of the Appellant and its relevance to an innocent state of mind namely:

(a) in respect of the indecent assault offence, an honest but mistaken belief in consent, and

(b) in respect of sexual assault offences, an honest but mistaken belief in consent based on reasonable grounds.

64Ground 3: The Trial Judge erred in failing to advert in the summing up that an unreasonable but honestly held belief as to consent in respect of the indecent assault offence constituted an innocent state of mind.

65Ground 4: The Trial Judge erred in failing to identify in the summing up that the innocent state of mind as to consent differed in respect of the indecent and sexual assault offences. 

66Ground 5: The Trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the alleged admissions of the Applicant's co-offender Bradley O'Sullivan were not admissible against the Appellant (or any of the other Appellants) in consideration of their verdicts.

67Ground 6: The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and particularly so having regard to the Appellant's acquittal on grounds 2, 6 and 7 of the indictment.

68Ground 7: A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at the trial of fresh evidence.

69Ground 8: The following evidence was wrongly excluded on the basis that it offended against s 293(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986:

During the incident the Accused said to the Complainant ""I didn't know you were like this"" to which the Complainant replied ""I'm full of surprises"".

70Ground 9: In relation to Count 5 the Trial Judge erred in directing the jury on the law of consent in accordance with s 61HA.

Tohu

71Ground 1(a): The Trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to what in law constituted reasonable grounds for a belief in consent for the purposes of s 61HA Crimes Act.

72Ground 1(b): The Trial Judge erred in failing to direct and explain to the jury that reasonable grounds for the purposes of s 61HA Crimes Act was not a reasonable person test.

73Ground 2: The Trial Judge erred in failing to advert at any point in the summing up to the evidence of the Appellant and its relevance to an innocent state of mind namely an honest but mistaken belief in consent based on reasonable grounds.

74Ground 3: The Trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the alleged admissions of the Appellant's co-offender Bradley O'Sullivan were not admissible against the Appellant (or any of the other Appellants) in consideration of their verdicts.

75Ground 4: A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at the trial of fresh evidence.

76Ground 5: The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
NRH

77Ground 1: The verdicts of guilty upon Counts 3, 4 and 5 of the indictment are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, particularly having regard to the acquittal of the Appellant on Count 2 (as well as 6 and 7) of the indictment.

78As is apparent, there is a large measure of commonality in the grounds of appeal. It is, therefore, convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal grouped into substantive issues. 

Fresh evidence
O'Sullivan: Ground 1
Flanders: Ground 7
Tohu: Ground 4

79The Appellants O'Sullivan, Flanders and Tohu say that a miscarriage of justice occurred because of the absence from the trial of certain fresh evidence.

80The evidence was contained in a statutory declaration and was led at the hearing of the appeal from the deponent Michaela Pratten. Ms Pratten said that she had known the Complainant for about two years at the time of the relevant events and had developed a friendship with her in this time.

81She said that on 12 January 2008 she attended Woy Woy Leagues Club at about 1:30am after she finished working at the Bayview Hotel at Woy Woy. She was in the company of her then partner Dana Cooper. As she arrived she saw the Complainant leaving the Leagues Club and they stopped and had a conversation as follows:

Pratten: Where you going?

Complainant: I've organised to have a threesome with Brad and one of his mates.
Pratten: Your (sic) fucking kidding aren't you. You're a fucking joke.

82Ms Pratten that she became quite upset and angry and felt that she just wanted to go home after this exchange. 

83Since that time she heard that the Complainant had been raped and that four men were found guilty of raping her but she was not aware of the details.

84Until about eight weeks before the time she made the statutory declaration on 30 November 2010 nobody had approached her about the matter for the purpose of giving evidence or providing a statement. At about that time another friend Holly Johnston approached Ms Pratten at the Ettalong pub and was very upset about what had happened to the Appellant Flanders. Holly told her that the Complainant had testified that she was only going to have sex with Brad on the evening the assault took place. Ms Pratten said to Holly Johnston:

That's fucking bullshit. She told me she had organised a threesome with Brad and one of his mates. 

Holly Johnston told her that Flanders was locked away for the assault, and that was when Ms Pratten realised she might have information that might assist. 

85The principles concerned with adducing fresh evidence after a trial were summarised by Kirby J (Mason P and Levine J agreeing) in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]. It is not necessary to set out those principles. It is sufficient to note that those principles make clear that a court hearing an application to adduce fresh evidence is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the absence of the evidence from the trial. Further, in circumstances where a new trial is sought three questions need to be answered. First, is the evidence fresh? If so, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief or ""plausible""? Thirdly, if so, would that evidence, with the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused? 

86The Crown, in its written submissions, accepted that the Appellants were probably capable of establishing that the evidence was not available at the trial even with the exercise of due diligence. The Crown also accepted that the evidence could impact on the credibility of the Complainant, and could support the evidence of O'Sullivan regarding discussion of a threesome.

87The Crown's principal opposition to the fresh evidence was that it was not credible evidence and, when seen with the other evidence at the trial, would not be likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. 

88The Crown cross-examined Ms Pratten to show (somewhat surprisingly in the light of the Crown's partial concession about the freshness of the evidence) that Ms Pratten was sufficiently aware of what had happened to the Complainant and the fact that the four Appellants had been charged and tried, and that she had ample opportunity to come forward at an earlier time. The Crown also cross-examined in the light of affidavits it had obtained from Dana Cooper to suggest that no such thing had been said by the Complainant to Ms Pratten. Further, the Crown suggested that since there was a lockout at the Leagues Club at the time Ms Pratten said she was intending to go to the Club, the evidence appeared to be less than credible. The Crown wished to lead this evidence on the application but the Court held that it was not entitled to do so. In our opinion it would rarely be appropriate for this Court to permit evidence to be led contrary to the evidence that is sought to be given. In such a situation the result of leading such evidence would be that it would be necessary for this Court to make factual findings, including credibility findings about competing witnesses. The Court's task is only to decide if the evidence is credible or plausible evidence.

89After hearing Ms Pratten's evidence the Crown submitted that there was no proper explanation that she had not come forward earlier. The Crown pointed to the fact that on the morning following the sexual encounter Ms Pratten was aware of the allegations made because she went to the Complainant's home to comfort her. The Crown also pointed to the fact the Ms Pratten attended at the trial, albeit for about five minutes during legal argument. In the Crown's contention she must have realised that her evidence was of significance.

90In Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 Barwick CJ said at 520 that where the Court is considering whether the verdict of guilty should be set aside outright the Court should form and act upon its own belief in, or disbelief of, the evidence, whereas in cases where the Court is considering whether there should be a new trial the Court should consider whether the evidence was capable of belief and likely to be believed by a jury. For a guilty verdict to be quashed and an acquittal entered fresh evidence must be shown to have such cogency that innocence is shown by reason of the evidence: Abou-Chabake at [63] - fifth point. In our opinion the fresh evidence of Ms Pratten is not of that kind. At best it is evidence that the jury should have had available when it came to consider the competing accounts of events put forward by the Complainant on the one hand and by O'Sullivan and Flanders on the other. It is necessary to consider, therefore whether the evidence is capable of belief and likely to be believed by a jury. 

91Despite the cross-examination of Ms Pratten she did not waver from her recollection that the conversation she had with the Complainant was as Ms Pratten related it. In those circumstances the evidence was credible. If it was placed before a jury and, if evidence is led by the Crown, such as the evidence of Ms Cooper that the conversation did not take place, whether it is believed will be a matter for the jury to determine. That position may be contrasted with a situation where a person in Ms Pratten's position began to doubt, by reason of the cross-examination, if she had accurately remembered the conversation, or accurately recalled that it had taken place at the time that she said it did. In such circumstances this Court might conclude that the evidence was not credible. 

92It is then necessary to ask if there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused if this evidence was heard by them: Abou-Chabake at [63] - ninth point.

93In our opinion if this evidence went to the jury with the other evidence in the case there is such a significant possibility for two reasons. First, it would tend to undermine the evidence of the Complainant that she did not agree to have a threesome, and did not have the telephone conversation that O'Sullivan and Flanders said she had with them concerning a threesome. Her credibility generally might thereby be affected. Secondly, it would tend to support the credibility of both O'Sullivan and Flanders who gave evidence of such a conversation. Bearing in mind that (except in relation to the attempted sexual intercourse) the jury acquitted the Appellants on the counts where they did not admit to the sexual act alleged and convicted on those where they did, the diminution of the Complainant's credibility and the bolstering of the credibility of O'Sullivan and Flanders in relation to this present issue is likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the Accused.

94For this reason alone the appeals of O'Sullivan, Tohu and Flanders should be upheld and a new trial ordered. 

Section 293(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986

O'Sullivan: Ground 2
Flanders: Ground 8

95At the trial before Judge Phegan, O'Sullivan made application on the second day under s 293 Criminal Procedure Act to lead evidence (and cross-examine the Complainant) about a conversation between O'Sullivan and the Complainant which took place at an unspecified point during the events giving rise to the charges. Although the time was unspecified the conversation must have taken place when the four men were in the bedroom with the Complainant. O'Sullivan said to the Complainant ""I didn't know you were like this"" to which the Complainant replied ""I'm full of surprises"".

96The application was said to be about evidence;

that would or may imply that the Complainant has had a sexual experience or sexual experiences at about the time of the commission of this offence.

It may be taken, therefore, that it was sought to make the evidence admissible under s 293(4)(a).

97Section 293 relevantly provides:

293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience

(1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence.

(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible.

(3) Evidence that discloses or implies:

(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or

(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity,

is inadmissible.

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply:

(a) if the evidence:

(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and

(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed,

98It was not made clear precisely when, during the sexual encounter, this conversation was said to have occurred. The Crown submits that it was apparently at a time before oral intercourse commenced with Tohu, and when it was apparent that the Complainant was going to have a sexual encounter with multiple men. The Crown submits, therefore, that the comment was effectively O'Sullivan saying:

Given what I know about your sexual reputation, I didn't know that you were the type of girl who would have sex with multiple men. 

Accordingly, the Crown submits that Phegan ADCJ was correct in ruling that it was a comment about the Complainant's sexual reputation and was therefore inadmissible under s 293(2). 

99In Melbourne v R [1999] HCA 32; (1999) 198 CLR 1 McHugh J said:

[33] In its strict sense, character refers to the inherent moral qualities of a person or what the New Zealand Law Commission has called ""disposition - which is something more intrinsic to the individual in question"". It is to be contrasted with reputation, which refers to the public estimation or repute of a person, irrespective of the inherent moral qualities of that person. As the last of the above passages from R v Falealili demonstrates, however, the common law courts have not always drawn a distinction between character and reputation in a criminal context. The confusion can be traced to R v Rowton where a majority of the Full Court of the Crown Cases Reserved held that in a criminal trial the evidence for or against a person's good character must be confined to his or her general reputation. This is the established rule although, as this Court pointed out in Attwood v The Queen, the limitations inherent in the rule are not observed in practice. In New South Wales, the legislature long ago reversed the common law rule. (citations omitted)

100In Bull v R [2000] HCA 24; (2000) 201 CLR 443 the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:

[57] In discussing evidence concerning the character of an accused in a criminal trial, the New Zealand Law Commission has pointed out that: 

On the one hand, the law distinguishes between evidence of general reputation and evidence of individual opinion and, in the case of the defendant in criminal proceedings, has historically recognised only the former. On the other hand, it is not always clear what is meant by reputation. On occasion, it appears to be used interchangeably with character. It may be important therefore to distinguish between character as public estimation - which is perhaps more correctly referred to as reputation - and character as disposition - which is something more intrinsic to the individual in question. (original emphasis) 

[58] The concept of disposition referred to in this passage obviously refers to a person's tendencies or propensities as things intrinsic to the individual in question which exist independently of other persons' opinions of those features. They are part of the character of the person so that given a relevant set of conditions or circumstances the person concerned has a tendency or propensity to act in a particular way. In contrast, the general opinion that others have of those features may constitute part of the person's reputation. Thus, a person who anonymously donates large sums of money to charity may have a reputation for being miserly, but in truth that person's disposition is charitable.

101It appears to us that the evidence sought to be admitted by the Appellants went not to the reputation of the Complainant but to her disposition. Certainly her own response cannot be regarded as having anything to do with her reputation. O'Sullivan's statement is not a reference to the public estimation or repute of the Complainant but is concerned with things intrinsic to the Complainant which may properly be described as her disposition. 

102Sub-section (4) sets out the exceptions to the prohibition contained in sub-s (3). In our opinion the evidence sought to be admitted falls within the exception in para (a). The result is that the evidence ought to have been admitted. 

103If this evidence had been admitted, it was evidence that clearly related both to the issue of the consent of the Complainant to what was happening and to the issue of the belief of O'Sullivan, and any of the other Appellants who heard the conversation, that the Complainant was consenting to what was happening. It was a significant piece of evidence for the jury to weigh in the balance with other evidence at the trial.

The admissions of O'Sullivan

Flanders: Ground 5
Tohu: Ground 3

104At one point during the sexual encounters the Complainant allegedly told the Appellants to ""fuck off, [to] get out of here, just fuck off and leave me alone"". When she did so Flanders, Tohu and NRH left the room but O'Sullivan remained. The Complainant gave this evidence:

Q You also indicated in evidence that the accused, Bradley O'Sullivan, stayed in the room at that point after you said those words and the other three ran off?
A. Yeah.

Q. Is that right?
A. Yep but I could still hear their voices and that and I remember Bradley saying that ""They're gone"" and I said ""No, I know they're"" - no I knew they weren't, you could hear the voices and that and Bradley went to go out and I thought he was leaving the cabin as well and I was heading into, got up because actually I remember I was trying to find something to cover myself and that and I found on the right side down on the bed some clothing, some pants, jama pants or something and Bradley had walked back into the room. I tried putting my top down too. My top was still on but it was up here and I pulled that down and that's when Bradley lost it.

Q. Well can I just stop you there, you've said to us that you got up to find something to cover yourself? 
A. Uh huh.

Q. At this point in time what clothes did you have on? 
A. I only had on my bra, singlet and black top still but they were up above, under my armpits.

Q. You indicated you found something to cover yourself? 
A. Yeah.

Q. And you indicated it was then that Brad lost it?
A. Yes.

Q. What do you mean by that? 
A. Bradley O'Sullivan started walking up and down the bedroom saying ""What the fuck have I done, what the fuck have I done"" and that. ""I didn't mean for this to happen and he apologised ""I'm sorry"", he should never. He was walking down, he was, I trusted him. ...

Q. You were telling us about your conversation you were having with Bradley O'Sullivan after the other three had left the bedroom? A. Yes.

Q. Did the accused, Bradley O'Sullivan, say something like, ""If you have to dob, don't dob the others in just dob me in""? 
A. Yes.

Q. Did he also say something like, ""I'm not fucking going to gaol""? A. Yes.

Q. When he was saying that what was he doing?
A. I was sitting at the end of the bed crying and he's walking up and down in front of me of the bed with his hands to his head just doing this, ""What the fuck have I done"" and just like at a real frustration or - he was upset.

Q. Can I say this, when you've given that evidence, what you've demonstrated is that you put your two hands up above your forehead on your hair?
A. Like this, yeah.

Q. And you've been moving your head forward and back? 
A. He was walking up and down. He was walking up and down, yes, like this, ""What the fuck have I done. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen"" and at that I told him just to get out to fuck off again, I said that a lot for him just to leave.

Q. And when you said that to him did he leave? 
A. No.

Q. What happened next?
A. I just got up and walked and went to the bathroom, closed the door, put the cane basket up against it and I could hear him saying things in the effect of offering what he could do to fix it if I wanted money. I said, ""I don't want your fucken money"" and I - and I was in the shower and that's where he must have left because I never seen him again after that - that night.

105In the course of her address the Prosecutor said this of that evidence:

Interesting too, what did she say Brad O'Sullivan says after this incident. She says a number of things. She tells you about conversations she had with Brad O'Sullivan. He says a number of things and they are these. ""What the fuck have I done?"" and he's got his hands on his head. You remember she demonstrated, he was going backwards and forwards saying, ""What the fuck have I done?"" Then he says, ""I'm not fucking going to gaol."" And, ""If you have to dob, don't dob the others in, just dob me in."" Now if we just think about that, not going to gaol, don't dob on the others, you might think why is he asking her not to dob on the others if they hadn't been involved. No reason to say, ""Don't dob in the others,"" if two out of four didn't participate in any way, shape or form. And why is he concerned about going to gaol. Well the Crown says that suggests, you might think, that he knew precisely what had happened in that room and he knew, having regard to her distressed state at this time that she would report the matter and that he and his friends would be in big trouble and that's why he says that to her and you also, if you accept the evidence of JS, know that when she's in the shower, through the bathroom door he offers her money to fix it. To fix what, if nothing's happened. They're all matters the Crown says support JS in relation to certainly Bradley O'Sullivan's feelings about his responsibility and wrongdoing on this night.

106When the Trial Judge summed up to the jury his Honour did not tell the jury that that evidence was only admissible against O'Sullivan. Further, when dealing with the evidence of each of the Appellants in his summing up, he said this:

You have heard the evidence of each of the accused in respect of those matters, and you are entitled to consider, in respect of the case for each individual accused and the Crown case, the evidence of each of the other accused. That is, the evidence given by each of the accused during the course of the trial is generally available for your consideration in respect of the whole of the case. I say that to distinguish it from the only exhibits which were tendered on a limited basis, and those were Exhibits P, Q, R and S, which were those documents referred to as being ""admissions"", where each of the accused admitted they had been at the premises on the relevant night, and in addition, Mr Flanders admitted that he had been wearing a red t-shirt. 

Those admissions can only be used in respect of the case in respect of the individual accused, because he is the one making the admission. However, in the circumstances of this case, you might think you have abundant evidence otherwise, and in fact, when the accused have given evidence, they have said they were there, and that evidence they gave in the trial, can be used in respect of each of the cases. So you may well think that Exhibits P, Q, R and S take you no further than the evidence that was in fact given, except to the extent that the accused were prepared to make those admissions.

107His Honour reinforced that direction later in his summing up by saying this:

I told you in my opening remarks this was a joint trial, and that really what you had occurring was four separate trials, one in respect of each accused, that they were being held together because as you have seen from the progress of the trial, the bulk really with the exception of Exhibits Q, R, S and T (sic), all of the evidence is admitted and available generally in the trial. So it is a matter of convenience and economy to proceed with one trial to which the four accused are party rather than four separate trials and have to repeat the matter on four occasions.

108A little later in his summing up his Honour made reference to the Prosecutor's address dealing with this evidence where she said:

Why would he [O'Sullivan] be making those sorts of comments unless it was an acknowledgement that all that had happened beforehand was without consent, and an acknowledgement of the participation of each of the other Accused in those events. 

His Honour made no comment to the jury that that evidence was only relevant to the case against O'Sullivan.

109None of the counsel for the other Accused sought a direction from the Judge at the trial notwithstanding the Crown's address and notwithstanding what his Honour had said in his summing up. Rule 4 applies in the circumstances. No evidence has been put before the Court to explain the decisions made by counsel at the trial.

110The Crown submitted that it was impossible to know if the jury had acted on the evidence set out in paragraph [104] above, with the verdicts they returned not confirming that they did so. The Crown submitted further that it was difficult to see how the jury would have used the second aspect of the admissions made by O'Sullivan against the other three Appellants. The Crown submitted that all that the evidence was capable of showing was that O'Sullivan felt regret for what had happened, and it could not establish the relevant guilty states of mind of the other Appellants. 

111In our opinion the fact that the trial judge identified particular parts of the evidence which could not be used against all of the Accused is likely to have conveyed to the jury that the remainder of the evidence, including these admissions of O'Sullivan, could be used against all of the Appellants. It is unfortunate that no counsel sought a redirection in terms of those admissions. Nevertheless, in our opinion the judge should have instructed the jury that this evidence was admissible only against O'Sullivan. The matter touching Rule 4 will be discussed later. 

The issue of consent

Tohu: Grounds 1 and 2
O'Sullivan: Grounds 3 and 4
Flanders: Grounds 1 to 4, and 9

112By reason of the joinder of the counts charged it was no easy task for the trial judge to differentiate the different tests for knowledge about consent applicable to the different counts charged in a way that would be readily understandable by the jury. Counts 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 were governed by s 61HA Crimes Act 1900 whereas Counts 1 and 5 were governed by the common law. So much is clear: WO v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 275 at [80]. The distinction would not have been an easy one for the jury to appreciate and would have even been harder to apply to the different counts charged in the consideration of the facts that gave rise to each of those counts. 
113Section 61HA relevantly provides:

61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences

(1) Offences to which section applies

This section applies for the purposes of the offences under sections 61I, 61J and 61JA.

(2) Meaning of consent

A person consents to sexual intercourse if the person freely and voluntarily agrees to the sexual intercourse.

(3) Knowledge about consent

A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if:

(a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or

(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or

(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case:

(d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but

(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person.

...

(7) A person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse.

(8) This section does not limit the grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse.

114When his Honour summed up to the jury he dealt with the issue of consent first when dealing with Count 1. No criticism is made of the directions in respect of Count 1 in that regard. His Honour then dealt with the issue of consent in relation to Count 2 and relevantly said this:

On the other hand, you may decide that he might have believed, although wrongly, that the Complainant was consenting to intercourse with him. Whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends on whether the Accused honestly held it, and if so, whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief. 

...

Now, I have already indicated that the Crown can prove the Accused had a guilty state of mind in one of two ways. Either he actually knew that JS was not consenting, or he had no reasonable grounds for his belief that she was consenting. 

115There could be no criticism of his Honour's direction in relation to consent in that regard in relation to Count 2. However, his Honour went on to say this:
The elements of the offence are the same in respect of Counts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. 

...

[Y]ou should commence your deliberations by determining those first three elements. 

That is,

1. That the individual Accused had sexual intercourse with JS, or in Count 5 that Shay Flanders attempted to have sexual intercourse with her,

2. In respect of all counts, that it was without JS's consent,

3. That the relevant principal accused in each of those counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 knew that JS was not consenting.

Now, if you are unable to find, dealing for the moment again with Count 2, any one of those first three elements in respect of the Accused, Mr NRH, he would not be guilty, and also none of the other Accused in respect of that particular offence would be guilty either, because the Crown would not have proved that he had, in fact, had sexual intercourse with her, that it was without her consent, and that he knew that she was not consenting. 

That similarly applies when you come to consider each of the other counts, including Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7.
116His Honour then had his written directions provided to the jury in relation to each of the Counts and in respect of each of the Appellants. He then took the jury through the written directions concerning Count 1. The jury were sent out for morning tea and his Honour asked counsel ""Is there anything so far?"" and all counsel said that there was not. 

117In relation to Count 5 (the attempted intercourse) the written directions relevantly said this:

Consent - A person consents to an act by another person if they freely and voluntarily agree to the act being performed by that other person. That consent can be communicated by the words or acts of the Complainant. Similarly, absence of consent does not have to be in words; it also may be communicated in other ways, such as the offering or resistance although this is not necessary as the law specifically provides that a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse.

...

For the purpose of determining whether the Accused Shay FLANDERS knew she was not consenting to the attempted sexual intercourse you must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including any steps taken by Shay Flanders to ascertain whether she was consenting to the sexual intercourse. 

...On the other hand, you may decide that he might have believed, although wrongly, that [JS] was consenting to the attempted intercourse with him. Whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends on whether the Accused honestly held it and, if so, whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief...

118In relation to each of the other Appellants and this Count his Honour said in his written directions:

In order to establish that the [each of the other Appellants] was an aider and abetter the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt:

...

[T]hat [each of the Other Appellants] knew all of the essential facts (that there was attempted sexual intercourse, that it was without the consent of [JS], and that Shay Flanders knew she was not consenting)...
119After the morning tea adjournment his Honour then took the jury through his written directions and when he reached Count 5, he said this:
If you go to Count 5 of the document, this is the Count in which the allegation is there was an ""attempt"". So you will see that in setting out at the top of p. 47 what the charge is I have put the word ""attempt"" in bold just to ensure that you have it in mind that that charge is slightly different in its terminology to the preceding charges. Then the act, ""sexual intercourse"", is set out, then, as that is an allegation that Mr Flanders was the principal, he is now set out as the first person you should deal with in respect of that Count, and all of those same matters as to ""attempt"", ""consent"", ""knew she was not consenting"", ""in company"" and ""common purpose"", and what you do in respect of your findings in respect of the elements are set out on three possible verdicts,

...

Now, one thing that is different in respect of Count 5 is that under ""meaning"" and ""relevance of, you will find that I have put at the top of p 48, the word ""attempt"" and what that means. That, of course, is not included in any of the earlier matters because they are not alleged to be ""attempts""; they are alleged to be completed acts, and you will see that what I have said there is that the Crown must establish first that Shay Flanders intended to commit the particular crime of having sexual intercourse with JS without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting.

...

You will find that then set out are the same material as you have already seen in the other ones in respect of the co-accused, that is Mr O'Sullivan at p.53, Mr Tohu at p.56, and Mr NRH at p.59, of course setting out all of the usual matters including the possible verdicts.

120The written directions in relation to Count 5 constituted, by reason of what was said in WO v DPP, an incorrect statement of the test concerning the belief of the Appellant concerning consent. His Honour should have directed the jury that if the Appellant honestly, though wrongly, believed the Complainant was consenting to sexual intercourse he was not guilty of the attempt to have sexual intercourse with her. His Honour wrongly reinforced his error by aligning his oral directions on Count 5 with his directions concerning consent in relation to Count 2 and the other counts. There is no requirement that the Appellant have reasonable grounds for believing that the Complainant consented to the sexual intercourse. His Honour further reinforced the error by saying ""now, one thing that is different in respect of Count 5 is... the word 'attempt' and what that means"".

121The directions given by his Honour with respect to Count 5 were erroneous. However, no counsel requested his Honour to correct the direction given. Rule 4 applies. As noted above its application will be discussed later.

122In addition, Flanders submitted that the Trial Judge's directions in relation to consent were inadequate because his Honour did not advert to Flanders' evidence nor relate his evidence to a relevant matter of law, namely an honest but mistaken belief in consent (Count 1) and a belief in consent based on reasonable grounds (Counts 3 and 4). 

123What was said to be lacking in the Trial Judge's instructions was that he did not explain to the jury what constituted reasonable grounds for a belief in consent, that the test was not whether the reasonable person might have believed in consent but rather whether the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the belief held by the Accused was not based on reasonable grounds, and that the jury needed guidance as to the mandatory provision of s 61HA(3)(d), namely that the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case which must include subjective factors relevant to the Accused.

124Flanders also submitted that the test in s 61HA(3) was not a completely objective test. Rather, the subjective element (the honest belief) was to be tested by demonstrating reasonable grounds for the subjective belief. Decisions in relation to the test for self-defence such as Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) (1987) 162 CLR 645 and Re Conlon (1993) 69 A Crim R 92, were called in aid. It was submitted that the meaning to be given to the words in the statute ought to be seen in the light of the use of similar words in other areas of the criminal law such as self-defence. In Zecevic the Court said that where self-defence is raised the question to be asked is whether the accused believed on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did. In Conlon Hunt CJ at CL said (at 98):
But it is clear from the formulation of the issue in Zecevic v DPP that it is the belief of the accused, and not that of the hypothetical reasonable person in the position of the accused, which has to be reasonable.

125His Honour said in his written directions :

""Knew she was not consenting"" - There are three ways that the Crown can prove that [NRH] knew that [JS] was not consenting:

1) by establishing that at the time of the act he actually knew she was not consenting: or

2) by establishing that a the time of the act he was reckless as to whether she was consenting.

To establish that the accused was acting recklessly, the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, either:

(a) the accused's state of mind was such that he simply failed to consider whether or not [JS] was consenting at all, and Just went ahead with the act performed, even though the risk that she was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with the accused's mental capacity if he had turned his mind to it, or

(b) the accused's state of mind was such that he realized the possibility that [JS] was not consenting but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not.

If the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused at the time of the act was reckless as to whether [JS] consented to the act, then it is the law that the accused is taken to know that she did not consent to the act.

3) by establishing that at the time of the sexual intercourse he had no reasonable ground for believing that [JS] consented to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of determining whether the accused [NRH] knew she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse you must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including any steps taken by [NRH] to ascertain whether she was consenting to the sexual intercourse.

It is the accused's actual knowledge of the lack of consent with which you are concerned. You might therefore ask how the Crown can prove that the accused was aware that [JS] did not consent without an admission from the accused to that effect The Crown asks you to infer or conclude from other facts that it has set out to prove that the accused must have known and that he did indeed know that [JS] was not consenting.

In a situation where the complainant does not in fact consent, the accused's state of mind at the time of the act of intercourse might be that he actually knew that she was not consenting. That is a guilty state of mind for this offence. If the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that this was the state of mind of the accused at the time of the act of intercourse, then the third element of the charge has been made out.

On the other hand, you may decide that he might have believed, although wrongly, that [JS] was consenting to intercourse with him. Whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends upon whether the accused honestly held it and, if so, whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief. Therefore if you are not satisfied that the accused knew the complainant wasn't consenting, the Crown must prove one of two facts before you can find the accused guilty: either (a) that the. accused did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting or (b) that, if he did have an honest belief in consent, that he had no reasonable grounds for that belief.

It is for the Crown to prove that the accused had a guilty mind, and so if there is the reasonable possibility that the accused did honestly believe on reasonable grounds that [JS] was consenting, then you would have to find that this third element of the offence is not made out, and return a verdict of ""not guilty "" of this charge.

In determining whether the Crown has proved that the accused actually knew that the complainant was not consenting to intercourse with him you must take into account what steps were actually taken by the accused to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting to intercourse. (emphasis added)

126It is apparent from these directions that the jury was given a construction of s 61HA consistent with what was said in Zecevic and Conlon. The Trial Judge said in that regard:

Whether that belief amounts to a guilty state of mind depends upon whether the accused honestly held it and, if so, whether he had reasonable grounds for that belief. 

His directions followed carefully those set out in the Bench Book. There can be no criticism of them.

127The submission by Flanders was ultimately refined to a complaint that his Honour made no reference in his directions to all the circumstances of the case as sub-s (3) requires. Attention was directed to pages 6 and 7 of the written directions set out at [125] above. The submission was that where his Honour deals in the paragraph commencing ""On the other hand..."" (the paragraph dealing with erroneous belief about consent) the Trial Judge did not refer to the jury needing to have regard all the circumstances of the case. 

128That appears to us to ignore the way his Honour approached the written directions. He has followed faithfully the terms of sub-s (3) in the paragraphs numbered in the written directions (1)-(3) with the paragraph that immediately follows. It is in that last paragraph , following the part of sub-s (3) between sub-paragraphs (c) and (d), that his Honour refers to the jury having to have regard to all the circumstances of the case. That particular paragraph is not a paragraph about sub-s (3)(a) but about what is to be taken into account in respect of sub-s (3) generally. It was not necessary for his Honour to refer again to the jury needing to have regard to all the circumstances of the case when he was seeking to expand on what was said in sub-s (3) by such paragraphs as the one commencing ""On the other hand"". We see no error in that regard. 

129Flanders further submitted that, in any event, what his Honour failed to do was to advert to the evidence which constituted ""all the circumstances of the case"" relevant to the issue of knowledge and the reasonable grounds that the Appellant had for his belief.

130No counsel asked for his Honour to do what is now, on the appeal, submitted should have been done by the Trial Judge. Relevantly, the only application made was one by Flanders' counsel at the beginning of the third day of the summing up. His Honour was asked to sum up the defence cases to the jury, and reference was made to R v Condon (1995) 83 A Crim R 335. After some argument his Honour declined to do what was asked, saying that in his view he had put the defence case properly by referring to the addresses made by counsel. 

131Subject to the matter discussed below, what his Honour did was entirely in accordance with what was said in Condon. In that case Allen J (with whom Newman and Simpson JJ agreed) said (at 347-8):

The first is that it is the task of the trial judge not merely to give formal directions of law as to the legal elements of the offence charge but to explain to the jury the application of those elements to the respective cases of the Crown and of the accused. In short, it is his duty to give them assistance so that they understand what the critical issues of fact are upon application of the law to the particular case. The trial judge is not relieved from that duty by the arguments of counsel. Indeed, as Murphy J pointed out in Salvo, it would not be enough even for the trial judge accurately to state what the case for the accused is as it has been presented. He must instruct the jury what the law is in respect of that case and do so in terms which throw up, clearly, what the critical issues of fact are which it raises.

I do not overlook that since the observations of this Court in R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 as to the duties of the trial judge in summing up s405AA of the Crimes Act 1900 was enacted. So far as relevant that section provides: ""(1) A Judge of the Supreme Court or District Court need not summarise, at the end of a criminal trial before a jury, the evidence given in the trial if the Judge is of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, the summary is not necessary. (2) This section applies despite any rule of law or practice to the contrary. (3) Nothing in this section affects any aspect of a Judge's summing up function other than the summary of evidence in a trial.""

S405AA applied to the present trial. But even if it reasonably was open to his Honour to form the opinion that a summary of the evidence was not necessary as to which it is not necessary to express an opinion, s405AA does not relieve a trial judge of the duties to which I have referred. The fulfilment of those duties does not require that the evidence be summarised as distinct from the respective cases being stated and the jury instructed as to the application of the law to those cases. (emphasis added)

132His Honour summarised the addresses of each of the Appellants' counsel. We see no error in that regard. 

133The Appellants accepted that they had not addressed the jury ""in any detail as to the evidential basis for a belief in consent"" (to use the words of Flanders' counsel), nor had they dealt with all the circumstances of the case. Nevertheless, it was submitted in reliance upon R v Pemble [1971] HCA 20; (1971) 124 CLR 107 at 116 and upon what Davies J (with whom Simpson J and Grove AJ agreed) said in RH v R [2011] NSWCCA 98 at [56]-[62] that the Trial Judge should nevertheless have summed up to the jury in relation to those matters.

134The Appellants accept that no request was made to the Trial Judge to take this course. Rule 4 thus applies.

135The Crown submitted that there was no obligation on the Trial Judge to put forward matters in his summing-up that would have undermined the defence arguments. This was because the circumstances that would need to be detailed to the jury would be put to them on the assumption that that Complainant did not consent to the sexual acts. Nor, the Crown submitted, was it the role of the Trial Judge effectively to argue the Appellants' case in an evidentiary sense in a manner other than was desired by the Appellants.

136In our opinion the Crown's submissions should not be accepted. It is not clear why directing the jury's attention to circumstances which might have provided reasonable grounds for a belief in consent was either inconsistent with, or undermined, the way the Appellants put their case. Indeed, it is not easy to understand why the matters which went to the belief of the Appellants about the Complainant's consent were not corroborative of the case they were arguing. This was not a case where the issue of consent was to be determined by whether there was an express agreement to such, with concomitant considerations of whose evidence was to be accepted. If that had been the principal issue, a fall-back position based upon belief on reasonable grounds might have given rise to awkward forensic and tactical decisions. In such a case a trial judge taking the initiative of putting the fall-back position, although not raised by the defence in addresses, might have prompted concern on the defence side.

137In the present case the basis for the assertions of the Appellants that the Complainant consented to the sexual activity derived from the same matters or circumstances that would have been relied upon by them to establish their belief and the reasonable grounds for that belief. The Appellants gave evidence of these matters, the Crown cross-examined about those matters and the Appellants' counsel referred to them in closing addresses. In that way there was a real issue concerning the belief of the Appellants and whether they had reasonable grounds for their belief. 

138The Trial Judge had given directions about dealing with consent which, in respect of Counts 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 were entirely correct as far as they went. That is to say, he had correctly identified the proper legal test based upon s 61HA for Counts 3, 4, 6, and 7, and based upon the common law for Count 1.

139In Pemble Barwick CJ said (at 117-118):

Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part.

...

Here, counsel for the defence did not merely not rely on the matters now sought to be raised; he abandoned them and expressly confined the defence to the matters he did raise. However, in my opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge of the duty to put to the jury with adequate assistance any matters on which the jury, upon the evidence, could find for the accused. (emphasis added)

140If that is a trial judge's obligation even where counsel takes a deliberate course to the contrary, it is the more so where the issue has clearly been raised by the evidence and the addresses. Further support for that proposition is to be found in the dissenting judgment of Gleeson CJ in Doggett v The Queen [2001] HCA 46; (2001) 208 CLR 343:

[2] The manner in which a trial is conducted, and in which the issues are shaped, especially where (as in the present case) an accused is represented by experienced and competent counsel, has a major influence upon the way in which the case is ultimately left to the jury, and upon the directions, comments and warnings, from the trial judge to the jury, that may be appropriate or necessary. Directions are not ritualistic formularies. Their purpose is to assist the jury in the practical task of resolving fairly the issues which have been presented to them by the parties.

141Apart from the absence here of a specific request to the Trial Judge to put to the jury what is now contended for, and a subsequent refusal by him to do so, the present case does not differ from RH v R - see especially at [59]-[61].

142It must immediately be said that, although we consider that his Honour erred in not making some reference to the matters relevant to reasonable grounds for the Appellants' belief (""all the circumstances of the case""), no criticism can be levelled at his Honour in that regard. His Honour, as we have noted, did not have an easy task in directing this jury generally given the number and nature of the Counts charged, the subtle differences in the tests for consent between the Counts, and the failure (or deliberate decision) of Counsel to request his Honour to direct appropriately. In that regard Rule 4 must now be discussed.

Rule 4

143Three matters were argued on this appeal where Rule 4 has application. These concern (1) directions regarding O'Sullivan's admissions, (2) directions regarding the proper test for consent with respect to Count 5, and (3) directions with regard to factual matters relevant to reasonable grounds for belief in consent. Leave is, therefore, necessary to allow the grounds of appeal associated with those matters. The onus is on the Appellants to show that the asserted errors have caused a miscarriage of justice: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [72].

144In respect of the first matter concerning O'Sullivan's admissions, whilst the matter is of some significance, if that were the only error made in the summing up, we would not regard the matter as appropriate for the grant of leave. That error alone is unlikely to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In relation to the direction concerning Count 5 different considerations apply. In Ka Chung Fung v R [2007] NSWCCA 250; (2007) 174 A Crim R 169 Latham J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed) said in relation to Rule 4 at [48]:

I acknowledge that a failure to direct correctly or at all, in relation to the elements of an offence, stands in quite a different category, and that in such a case an applicant will generally be able to persuade the Court that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.

145Further, when all three Rule 4 matters are considered together with the s 293 matter we consider that leave should be granted. A refusal to do so is likely to result in a miscarriage of justice for the reasons we have discussed when considering the grounds concerned. . 

Are the verdicts unreasonable?

O'Sullivan: Ground 5
Flanders: Ground 6
Tohu: Ground 5
NHR: Ground 1

146Each Appellant appeals upon the basis that the verdict of the jury was ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence"": s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

147When dealing with such grounds of appeal, the Court is required to make an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence to determine whether the verdicts of guilty could be supported: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [21].

148That assessment is made so as to determine whether:

""... the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged"".

SKA at [21].

149In M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, the following propositions were made clear:

(a)the question is one of fact: M at 492 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ; 

(b)in answering the question, the Court must pay full regard to:

(i)the jury being the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence; and

(ii)consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses: M at 493.

150As the majority in M noted, if the Court upon reviewing the evidence has a doubt, then ordinarily that is a doubt which the jury should have experienced. However, there may be some cases in which a doubt experienced by a Court can be resolved because of the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence. If such a resolution is reached, then no miscarriage has occurred: M at 494.

151However, if a Court concludes, having made allowances for the advantage that a jury has, that there is ""... a significant possibility that an innocent person is being convicted ..."", then the verdict is bound to be set aside: M at 494.

152Each of the Appellants was found guilty on Counts 3, 4 and 5 in the indictment. The details of these counts are set out earlier at [25] and [26]. As well, the applicant, Flanders, was found guilty of Count 1. None of the other Appellants was charged with the conduct in Count 1. 

NRH

153It is to be remembered that NRH was said to have been the principal offender with respect to the conduct in Count 2. It was said that he had penile/vaginal intercourse without the consent of the Complainant. NRH gave evidence in which he denied engaging in that conduct at all. Clearly the jury was not satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the conduct occurred as was alleged by the Complainant.

154It was not said that he was a principal with respect to Counts 3, 4 and 5. Any conviction of NRH on those counts arises because of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise. 

155As we have earlier recounted, NRH was introduced to the Complainant when she collected him and Tohu from outside The Webb. She drove them to her flat and, upon arrival, gave them a drink.

156Leaving to one side the Complainant's evidence about NRH engaging in sexual activity with her, which the jury must have rejected in order to find him not guilty on Count 2, the substantial evidence as to what NRH did at the Complainant's flat came from his own evidence at trial. 

157In chief he denied that he was ever part of any understanding or arrangement to sexually assault the Complainant, he denied any knowledge of any understanding or arrangement between any other persons that they would sexually assault the Complainant and he denied that he in any way intentionally encouraged or assisted anybody to have sex with the complainant without her consent. 

158In cross-examination, he gave evidence that based upon what O'Sullivan had told him, text messages which he had seen and the fact that there was contact between her and O'Sullivan in the early hours of the morning, as a consequence of which he was invited back to the complainant's house, he believed that there was to be a threesome involving the Complainant, O'Sullivan and Flanders.

159When asked how he came to be in the bedroom, he said that he just wanted to ""be a sticky beak, just to see what they were doing"". 

160He said that when he looked into the room, the Complainant was already naked with Flanders on one side of her and O'Sullivan on the other. When pressed in cross-examination, he agreed he could not advance any particular reason why he remained in the room observing what was going on, but he simply ""just watched"" whilst O'Sullivan received oral sex.

161When pressed further in cross-examination he said: ""I just didn't leave, I was just sort of shocked.""

162He said that he left the bedroom when the Complainant called out ""stop,"" and walked away from the doorway where he had been standing.

163The only other evidence was that from the Complainant when she said that immediately after she attempted to prevent O'Sullivan going to a drawer in her bedroom, whilst she was lying, still clothed, on the bed, NRH was in the bedroom. She said: ""... that's when they were all in the bedroom by this time"". Her evidence was that it was after that point in time that her clothes were forcibly removed and that she was then assaulted without consent. 

164In submissions to the jury, the Crown said this with respect to NRH:

""NRH, the last accused to give evidence. He told you very clearly [he had] absolutely no interest in a sexual encounter that night. He agreed with the Crown that there was absolutely no reason for him to go anywhere near that bedroom that night. He knew about the threesome, but he wasn't in on it. So absolutely no purpose for him to go to that bedroom. He agreed, none of his business what was happening in there. He then tells us that he is not invited into the room, he goes in there, essentially to be a sticky beak, his words. He is not planning to be involved in any way, shape or form. He is a bit shocked by what he saw, but he stays there. And the Crown says to him, well, if you're not in on it, why do you stay there. And he's not sure, he can't give a reason for why he stood there. The Crown says to you that that is because, that's not why he was there, to have a sticky beak, he was in on it as well, he had already - he had a turn, he was the first to have a turn of penile/vaginal intercourse while Bradley O'Sullivan was having oral sex with the complainant.

The Crown says there is no logical explanation why you stand there and watch your friends having a threesome if you have no interest in the sexual encounter and be shocked by it.""

165In short the Crown submitted that the jury would not accept that explanation, and would accept the Complainant's evidence as to what NRH did to her. 

166In this Court, the Crown submitted that the verdicts on Counts 3, 4 and 5 with respect to NRH were not unreasonable because NRH's presence in the room was not ""mere presence"" but, that his presence in the bedroom was capable of being seen by the jury as evidence of a desire to assist and encourage his co-appellants as required, and a willingness to assist as required. It also relied upon the failure of NRH to leave or intervene during such conduct as being significant in all of the circumstances. 

167The Crown case was one of joint criminal enterprise. The jury rejected the participation of NRH in the events of that evening on the basis that he was a principal, and was taking his turn. There is no other conclusion available from the finding of a verdict of not guilty on Count 2. 

168That meant that the jury was left to infer the participation of NRH in the joint criminal enterprise by being present at a time when a crime was being committed and with knowledge that the crime was to be, or was being committed, that he intentionally assisted or encouraged another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime: see R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-7.

169We are not satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt, that NRH's presence, without anymore being said or done by him, was in the circumstances anything more than mere presence. He provided no encouragement to the others. There was no evidence that he said or did anything to encourage the conduct by O'Sullivan, Flanders and Tohu, which formed the basis of Counts 3, 4 and 5. There was no evidence that he even knew that a crime was being committed. On the contrary, his evidence was that he understood that what was happening was a consensual arrangement. 

170In all of those circumstances, we are satisfied that these convictions against NRH are unreasonable and cannot stand. On the evidence before the jury, it was not open to convict him of these offences. 

171We would uphold this ground of appeal in respect of NRH, and direct the entry of an acquittal of him, on Counts 3, 4 and 5. 

O'Sullivan, Flanders and Tohu

172The case against each of these three was with respect to Counts 3, 4 and 5, identical. There is no doubt that each accepted that they had participated in a joint activity in which each had sex with the Complainant, taking it in turns, one after the other.

173The principal issue joined between the Crown and these three Appellants was whether or not the Complainant consented to the conduct which was occurring. 

174The Complainant in her evidence denied that she consented to having sex with these three Appellants. She said that her clothes had been forcibly removed from her, and that her participation in each of the assaults, which constituted Counts 3, 4 and 5, was a forced one. She said for example, that her head was forced into a position where oral intercourse occurred. She said she had no opportunity to, effectively, resist and that she was physically hurt by what occurred. 

175On the other hand, each of the Appellants gave evidence, each denied that there was any force or violence involved in the assault and each asserted that the Complainant had consented, although not necessarily in express terms. 

176There was evidence before the jury that corroborated the Complainant's account. This included, but was not limited to, the complaints and the contents of them, which she made immediately after what occurred. 

177There was evidence, which the jury might consider corroborated the account of the Appellants. For example, there was no doubt that the Complainant had collected at least Mr Tohu from outside The Webb, and that she had welcomed Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Flanders to her home, and had provided them with alcohol. There was evidence that she had flirted, in a sexual manner, with the men present. There is no suggestion that, early in the morning, when these events occurred, that she had in any way asked any of the four males present in her small home, to leave. 

178Ultimately, however, the question of whether the Complainant did or did not consent was a matter that depended on a careful scrutiny of the way in which the Complainant and each of these three Appellants gave their evidence. 

179The principal issue between the Complainant and these Appellants was one which classically was a matter for the jury to determine. They were in a significant position of advantage when compared to an appellate Court. 

180It would not be right, in accordance with the authorities to which earlier reference has been made, for us to prefer a reading of the evidence, any doubt which that might create and any conclusions which we might draw as to the existence of a doubt, to the conclusions of the jury in the circumstances here present, where the jury had a decided advantage in assessing the credibility and demeanour of the Complainant on the one hand, and the credibility and demeanour of these three Appellants on the other. 

181Even if we were persuaded that a doubt exists, about which we need not reach any conclusion, it is a doubt which is properly resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses. We are not persuaded, in those circumstances, that the verdicts were unreasonable, or that with respect to Counts 3, 4 and 5, the appeal by O'Sullivan, Flanders and Tohu ought be upheld on this Ground.

182Mr O'Sullivan was also convicted, Count 1, of an indecent assault. The issue which separated the evidence of the Complainant and Mr O'Sullivan on this count, was whether or not there was any consent. 

183Consistently with our view on Counts 3, 4 and 5, this was a matter upon which the jury in making the determination, had a decided advantage.

184We would not be inclined to uphold the appeal on this Ground.

185In the result, on the Ground asserting that the verdict of the jury against each of the appellants was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence, we would propose that the appeal by NRH be upheld and that he be acquitted of the Counts against him. With respect to the remaining three applicants, we would not uphold this Ground. 

Conclusion

186For reasons given earlier we consider that, in relation to O'Sullivan, Tohu and Flanders, there should be a new trial by reason of the fresh evidence and as result of a combination of the errors which have been identified in the way the trial was conducted.

187In our opinion the following orders should be made:

(1) Appeals of each Appellant allowed.

(2) Quash the convictions of the Appellants.

(3) In respect of the Appellant NRH enter a verdict of acquittal.

(4) In respect of the Appellants O'Sullivan, Flanders and Tohu order a new trial in respect of Counts 1, 3, 4 and 5.

		25 April 2014",2012-09-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760141,Howard v Senior Constable Risteski [2012] NSWSC 1150,"Judgment

1On 6 March 2012, Mr Peter Michael Howard (the plaintiff) was convicted under s 4(1)(b) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (""the ILP Act"") of the offence of remaining on inclosed lands after being requested to leave and a fine of $200 was imposed on him. Pursuant to Pt 5, s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2011, Mr Howard now seeks orders in this court setting aside that conviction on grounds that his Honour Magistrate I Cheetham, erred in law in holding that, at the relevant time, Mr Howard was situated on inclosed lands within the meaning of the ILP Act.

2At the time of the incident on 1 August 2011, Mr Howard had climbed onto a fig tree situated on the footpath of Laman Street, Cooks Hill. From 19 July 2011, barricades had been erected by the Newcastle City Council (""the Council"") across the section of Laman Street between Darby and Dawson Streets, and fencing had been erected over the relevant section of Civic Park (Crown land) surrounding a group of fig trees (one of which was the one Mr Howard had climbed onto). It is accepted by the plaintiff that the barricades across Laman Street at the Darby and Dawson Streets intersections and the fencing were lawfully erected, and accepted by the defendant that the tree growing on the footpath can be said to be part of a road.

3The broad issue raised by the appeal is whether or not s 3(2) of the ILP Act applies to exclude the operation of s 4 to that portion of Laman Street in which Mr Howard was located when he refused to leave the site at the request of a council officer (""the Incident Location"").

4I set out the factual findings made in the Court below and accepted before me to be correct:

""Firstly, Newcastle City Council lawfully erected a barrier bounded generally by part of Laman Street and part of Civic Park.

Secondly, on 1 August 2011 [the plaintiff] was sitting in a large tree growing on the footpath of Laman Street within the area from which persons had been excluded by the erection of a barrier.

Thirdly, [the plaintiff] was lawfully directed to come down from the tree and he refused.

Fourthly, Laman Street is a public road under the control of Newcastle City Council.

Fifthly, Civic Park is Crown land under the management of Newcastle City Council.

Sixthly, the barrier which had been erected was temporary fencing creating a compound which included part of Laman Street and part of the park known as Civic Park.

Seventhly, the parts of the land enclosed by the fencing were the adjoining or abutting street and park. The tree was on the footpath of the street.

Eighthly, the barriers meant that part of Laman Street was at that time not available to the public for thoroughfare.

And lastly, Laman Street is a public road under the Roads Act 1993.""

5The relevant sections of the ILP Act provide as follows:

""3 Definitions

(1) In this Act:

Inclosed lands means:

(a) prescribed premises, or
(b) any land, either public or private, inclosed or surrounded by any fence, wall or other erection, or partly by a fence, wall or other erection and partly by a canal or by some natural feature such as a river or cliff by which its boundaries may be known or recognised, including the whole or part of any building or structure and any land occupied or used in connection with the whole or part of any building or structure.

Road means any land proclaimed, dedicated, resumed or otherwise provided as a public thoroughfare or way or any land defined, reserved or left as a road in any subdivision of lands.

(2) Where a road is lawfully inclosed with the lands of any person, those lands, but not the road, shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the inclosed lands of the person.

4 Unlawful entry on inclosed lands

(1) Any person who, without lawful excuse (proof of which lies on the person), enters into inclosed lands without the consent of the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands, or who remains on those lands after being requested by the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands to leave those lands, is liable to a penalty not exceeding:

(a) 10 penalty units in the case of prescribed premises, or
(b) 5 penalty units in any other case."" 

(emphasis added)

6I also set out four other legislative provisions to which reference will be made:

Roads Act 1993

Dictionary

public road means:

(a) any road that is opened or dedicated as a public road, whether under this or any other Act or law, and
(b) any road that is declared to be a public road for the purposes of this Act.

road includes:

(a) the airspace above the surface of the road, and
(b) the soil beneath the surface of the road, and
(c) any bridge, tunnel, causeway, road-ferry, ford or other work or structure forming part of the road.

5 Right of passage along public road by members of the public

(1) A member of the public is entitled, as of right, to pass along a public road (whether on foot, in a vehicle or otherwise) and to drive stock or other animals along the public road.
(1A) The right conferred by this section extends to the right of passage of members of the public in a light rail or other railway vehicle.
(2) The right conferred by this section does not derogate from any right of passage that is conferred by the common law, but those rights are subject to such restrictions as are imposed by or under this or any other Act or law.
(3) For example, those rights are subject to such restrictions as are imposed:

(a) by or under the road transport legislation within the meaning of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005, or
(b) by or under section 72 of the Crown Lands Act 1989 (Cultivation of enclosed roads).

115 Roads authority may regulate traffic in connection with road work etc

(1) A roads authority may regulate traffic on a public road by means of barriers or by means of notices conspicuously displayed on or adjacent to the public road.

(2) The power conferred by this section may be exercised by [Roads and Maritime Services] for any purpose but may not be exercised by any other roads authority otherwise than:

(a) for the purpose of enabling the roads authority to exercise its functions under this Act with respect to the carrying out of road work or other work on a public road, or
(b) for the purpose of protecting a public road from serious damage by vehicles or animals as a result of wet weather, or
(c) for the purpose of protecting earth roads from damage caused by heavy vehicles or by animals, or
(d) for the purpose of protecting members of the public from any hazards on the public road, or
(e)for the purpose of protecting vehicles and other property on the public road from damage, or
(f) for the purpose of enabling a public road to be used for an activity in respect of which a permit is in force under Division 4 of Part 9, or
(g) for a purpose for which the roads authority is authorised or required, by or under this or any other Act or law, to regulate traffic.

(4) A person:

(a) must not, in wilful contravention of any such notice or in wilful disregard of any such barrier, pass along, or cause any vehicle or animal to pass along, a length of public road, and
(b) must not damage, remove or otherwise interfere with a notice or barrier erected for the purposes of this section.

Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units.

Interpretation Act 1987

33 Regard to be had to purposes or objects of Acts and statutory rules

In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or statutory rule or, in the case of a statutory rule, in the Act under which the rule was made) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.

7The Magistrate held that s 3(2) of the ILP Act did not apply to the Incident Location because that section of the road was not available to the public as a thoroughfare as a result of the fencing and barricades erected by the Council.

8A plan of the incident area (Exhibit A) depicts, in a dark line consisting of dots and dashes, the fencing erected; the barriers erected at the two ends of Laman Street are also clearly depicted. There is no fence erected between the northern perimeter of Laman Street and Civic Park. As a practical matter, there was no need to erect such a fence because there was a fence erected further north on the boundary of Civic Park. There was therefore an almost rectangular-shaped area surrounded on all sides by fencing and barricades with gate access controlled by the Council. Within the rectangle was that portion of Laman Street next to which was located the tree in question. All of the lands within the rectangle, including Laman Street, were managed or under the control of the Council.

9Mr C L Fraser of counsel appears for the plaintiff. The plaintiff contends that by reason of the definition of ""road"" in s 3 of the ILP Act, s 3(2) applies to prevent s 4 from applying to Laman Street in the circumstances. 

10The plaintiff accepts that if s 3(2) does not apply, then his appeal must fail.

11Mr Fraser accepted that, had there been a fence erected on the northern side of Laman street, Laman Street would have been inclosed lands for the purposes of the ILP Act, but he submits that the absence of such a fence means that the Incident Location was not within ""inclosed lands"" as that term is defined in the ILP Act. Neither the public road nor the community land was, he submitted, ""in respect of themselves inclosed"". He also accepted that a road which has been proclaimed, dedicated, resumed or otherwise provided as a public thoroughfare can cease to have that character. The Roads Act by ss 33 - 42 contains provisions by which the status of ""public road"" can be lost or altered. He accepts also that by s 115 of the Roads Act, the Council, as a road authority, was permitted to effect a temporary closure of the road. His point is, however, that what was done pursuant to s 115 of the Roads Act, although lawful, did not preclude the road from continuing to be a road for the purposes of s 3(2) of the ILP Act and hence the road on which Mr Howard was located when asked to leave was expressly excluded from the definition of inclosed lands. 

12In pars 27 - 29 of his submissions, Mr Fraser contended that land otherwise provided as a public thoroughfare should be read as a discrete alternative from land ""proclaimed, dedicated or resumed"" as a public thoroughfare, in the definition of ""road"" in s 3(1) of the ILP Act, and that the learned Magistrate erred in focusing attention only on the phrase ""provided as a public thoroughfare"".

13The defendant's case is that:

(1)as at the date of the incident, Laman Street had been closed off and lawfully closed off pursuant to s 115 of the Roads Act;

(2)by virtue of the lawful closure of Laman Street, Laman Street between Darby and Dawson Streets was not a public thoroughfare;

(3)because it was not a public thoroughfare, it did not at the date of the incident meet the definition of ""road"" in s 3(1) of the ILP Act; and hence

(4)s 3(2) of the ILP Act did not apply;

(5)since s 3(2) did not apply, s 4 was not subject to any carve-out for Laman Street and therefore Mr Howard was in breach of the ILP Act because, having been asked to leave the land by a duly authorised officer of the Council, he remained on the land.

14The defendant does not challenge the contention that Laman Street was recognised as a public road and that, by virtue of s 5 of the Roads Act, it was a public thoroughfare within the meaning of the ILP Act up until the time of its closure, but relies on the fact that the status of roads within the Council's area is now exclusively governed by the Roads Act and that the road is only provided as a public thoroughfare subject to the qualifications imposed by the Roads Act. If the Roads Act permits closure (as it does and which has occurred in this case), then the defendant submits that Laman Street was not a public thoroughfare at the relevant time and therefore not a ""road"" within the meaning of s 3 of the ILP Act.

15The defendant also points out that even if it were necessary to trace back to the original dedication of Laman Street, it has done so and that dedication was also expressed to be ""subject to all such and the like regulations, orders, powers, authorities and provisions to which land used as a public thoroughfare now or is hereafter shall be subject by law"": see s 47 of the Towns Police Act (1838) 2 Vic No 2 (repealed). The defendant contends that on this approach the same result obtains, namely that the road when closed to public access is not a road for the purposes of s 3(2) of the ILP Act.

16The defendant contended that a road can be lawfully inclosed in the manner which Laman Street had been inclosed.

17The critical questions then are: 

(1)Did the fact that Laman Street ceased to be a public thoroughfare when closed pursuant to s 115 of the Roads Act mean that at the time of the incident it was not land proclaimed, dedicated, resumed or otherwise provided as a public thoroughfare?

(2)Does the fact that Laman Street had no fence on its northern perimeter prevent it from being inclosed lands?

18I should note that both parties relied on a passage in the judgment of Allsop P in Wilson v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 198; (2010) 78 NSWLR 704 at [12]:

""However, as is now beyond dispute, in construing an Act, a court is permitted to have regard to the words used by Parliament in their legal and historical context. Context is to be considered in the first instance, not merely when some ambiguity is discerned. Context is to be understood in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief or object to which the statute was directed. These are legitimate means of understanding the purpose of the Act and of the relevant provisions, against which the terms and structure of the provisions and the Act, [as] a whole, are to be understood. Fundamental to the task, of course, is the giving of close attention to the text and structure of the Act, as the words used by Parliament to effect its legislative purpose. Nevertheless, general words, informed by an understanding of the context, and of the mischief to which the Act is directed, may be constrained in their effect.""

19Mr Fraser (and Ms B K Baker, solicitor-advocate appearing for the defendant) also referred to what was said by McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [78]:

""However, the duty of a court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction (For example, the presumption that, in the absence of unmistakable and unambiguous language, the legislature has not intended to interfere with basic rights, freedoms or immunities: Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437.) may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning. In Statutory Interpretation, Mr Francis Bennion points out (3rd ed (1997) at 343-344):

""The distinction between literal and legal meaning lies at the heart of the problem of statutory interpretation. An enactment consists of a verbal formula. Unless defectively worded, this has a grammatical meaning in itself. The unwary reader of this formula (particularly if not a lawyer) may mistakenly conclude that the grammatical meaning is all that is of concern. If that were right, there would be little need for books on statutory interpretation. Indeed, so far as concerns law embodied in statute, there would scarcely be a need for law books of any kind. Unhappily this state of being able to rely on grammatical meaning does not prevail in the realm of statute law; nor is it likely to. In some cases the grammatical meaning, when applied to the facts of the instant case, is ambiguous. Furthermore there needs to be brought to the grammatical meaning of an enactment due consideration of the relevant matters drawn from the context (using that term in its widest sense). Consideration of the enactment in its context may raise factors that pull in different ways. For example the desirability of applying the clear literal meaning may conflict with the fact that this does not remedy the mischief that Parliament intended to deal with."" (footnotes omitted)""

and see also ss 33 of the Interpretation Act 1897 (set out at par [6] above).

20The history of the legislation is helpfully summarised by Johnson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Strang [2011] NSWSC 259 (""Strang"") at [40]. The ILP Act commenced in a rural and agricultural context but it is clear that it applies to both rural and urban lands, and by amendment in 1979 and 1987 the definition of ""inclosed lands"" was extended. At [52] of his Honour's judgment, Johnson J comments ""that the terms of ss 3 and 4 of the ILP Act are capable of extending to a variety of lands is apparent from the range of locations to which prosecutions have applied since 1979"" and his Honour then recites examples of its application. In Strang it was held that the ILP Act included commercial and retail premises within a larger retail shopping centre and applied even to premises open to the public. 

21It is clear from Strang at [52] - [64] and [70], and see Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Pedley [1911] St R Qd 255, that the delineations of land in the ILP Act and analogous legislation are not restricted literally to a fence.

22I regard the central purpose of the ILP Act as to prevent persons from entering onto land to which they have no right to enter and requiring them to leave that land when requested to do so by the owner of the land or person having relevant authority over the land (and also, but with no relevance to this case, to refrain from offensive conduct (s 5) after being asked to leave). Section 4 creates two offences (see Strang at [51]): one of entering into inclosed lands without lawful excuse and one of remaining upon such land without lawful excuse when asked to leave, so that even if a person may have a right to enter, he will commit an offence if, having been asked to leave, he does not do so. Mr Fraser and Ms Baker both made reference to the Second Reading Speech of Sir Henry Manning at the time of the introduction of s 3(2) in 1939 in which he said:

""In the second place the [Inclosed Lands Protection (Amendment) Bill] deals with the case where a road is inclosed with a property. The object of the amendment is to make the boundary of the property the boundary, not the road itself. Therefore a person would be entitled to go within the fence for the purpose of making use of the road."" (New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 August 1939 at 5877)

Ms Baker submitted that ""the clear intent of s 3(2) of the ILP Act was to ensure that the public had unimpeded rights of passage along public thoroughfares, even where the land surrounding the public thoroughfare was enclosed. There can be no purpose in the ILP Act carving out an exemption for land which cannot lawfully be used as a public thoroughfare."" Mr Fraser did not advance a purpose of ss 3(2) or 4 that would be promoted by the construction for which the plaintiff contends.

23In my view, s 3(2) of the ILP Act did not apply to the Incident Location and for the following reasons:

(1)I have made reference to what I take to be the central purpose of the ILP Act. The purpose of s 3(2) is to ensure that a person does not infringe the Act by entering on (or remaining on) a public thoroughfare which is inclosed on all sides by a fence, gate or other delineations and to make it clear that entry upon the land adjacent to the road, except in the specified circumstances in s 4, will constitute an infringement. That is the ""mischief"" to which s 3(2) is directed. The subsection and the definition appear to me to proceed upon the assumption that the reason that the person is on the inclosed land (that is, the road) is that they are making use of it, and are entitled so to do, as a public thoroughfare. Section 115(4) of the Roads Act prohibits a person from passing along or driving a vehicle along the barricaded area - there is no reason to treat a road that has been closed to the public as a public thoroughfare for the purposes of the ILP Act.

(2)Although ""public road"" is defined in the Roads Act, its meaning is not identical with ""road"" as defined in s 3(1) of the ILP Act. The word ""road"", by the dictionary in the Roads Act, includes airspace and the soil and bridges and tunnels and similar features, but it is not otherwise defined. There is no inconsistency in holding that Laman Street did not lose its status as a public road for the purposes of the Roads Act but did lose its status as a road for the purposes of the ILP Act.

(3)I can see no warrant for requiring permanent closure of a road pursuant to the Roads Act before s 3(2) is excluded. Mr Fraser's concession that, had an additional fence been installed on the northern side of Laman Street, it would have been inclosed land, is inconsistent with his contention that permanent closure under the Roads Act is required for s 3(2) to cease to be relevant.

(4)The notion that the Council should have to erect a fence on the northern perimeter of Laman Street to avail itself of the protection of the ILP Act demonstrates the unrealistic view of the legislation which is advanced on behalf of the plaintiff. Once it is conceded, as it is, that Laman Street was lawfully closed, its status as a road, which a person could enter (and not be required to leave) was removed.

(5)The plaintiff's argument that the road itself must be fenced on all sides seeks to impose a requirement which is not found in the legislation. Once it is determined that a road is not a road as defined in s 3(2), the only question is whether the road is part of an area of inclosed lands. The road in question here is clearly part of inclosed lands by virtue of the fence to the north of Laman Street, in conjunction with the other sides of the rectangular area. The Council was in charge of all the land within the inclosed area, including Laman Street.

(6)It is possible to read the definition of ""land proclaimed"" or ""dedicated"" as a public thoroughfare literally to mean that once a road has been proclaimed or dedicated as a public thoroughfare, it remains a road for the purposes of the ILP Act. Mr Fraser's acceptance that a road proclaimed, dedicated or resumed as a public thoroughfare can cease to have the character of a road, if the processes in ss 32 - 40 of the Roads Act are complied with, I think recognises that an interpretation which treats the status of land so proclaimed or declared as fixed or immutable is not correct.

Conclusion

24It follows that, in my view, the learned Magistrate's conclusion was correct in law and the appeal should be dismissed and conviction and penalty confirmed.

25The defendant does not seek costs so there will be no order as to costs.

2760146,Lewis v Shimokawa [2012] NSWCA 300,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
2McCOLL JA:  I agree with Hoeben JA.  
3HOEBEN JA:Nature of appealThe appellant brought proceedings in negligence against the respondent claiming damages for personal injury in respect of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on 21 November 2003.  There was no issue that a collision occurred between a vehicle driven by the respondent and the appellant's vehicle.  The only issue was whether the appellant was inside her vehicle at the time of the collision.
4The matter was heard in the District Court between 20 - 29 September 2010 and 24 - 25 May 2011.  Colefax DCJ delivered judgment on 1 July 2011.  His Honour found in favour of the respondent.  The appellant has appealed from that decision.
 Background
5On the afternoon of 21 November 2003 the appellant in the course of her work was driving a Toyota Hi Ace van south along the F6 Freeway from Sydney to Wollongong.  The Freeway in that direction consisted of two lanes, with an adjoining sealed breakdown lane.  Running alongside the breakdown lane was an iron guardrail.  The appellant was alone in the vehicle.  Weather conditions were not good and the Freeway was affected by fog and rain.  It was peak hour and there was a lot of traffic.
6At approximately 4.30pm the appellant's vehicle collided with the rear of a Holden Rodeo, being driven by Mr Josie McCaw (the McCaw vehicle).  This vehicle had three young men as its occupants; the driver, his brother Andrew and their friend, Mr Kevin Perkins.  
7Shortly after the appellant's vehicle collided with the McCaw vehicle, a 15 seater minibus (the respondent's vehicle) collided with the rear of the appellant's vehicle.  There were three occupants of the respondent's vehicle: the respondent who was the driver, his wife and a young friend of their son, Mr Naylor.  Very quickly after that collision, another vehicle collided with the trailer attached to the respondent's vehicle.  
8The incidents involving the McCaw vehicle, the appellant and the respondent's vehicles were not the only collisions in that vicinity at that time.  Many other collisions (possibly 30) occurred on that section of the Freeway at about that time.
9There was a dispute as to the severity of the impact between the appellant's vehicle and the McCaw vehicle.  The appellant contended that the impact was trivial, whereas the respondent contended that the impact was minor but not insignificant.  The importance of this dispute was that the respondent contended at trial that any genuine injury which the appellant may have suffered was caused by the first collision with the McCaw vehicle.
10There was no dispute that the respondent's vehicle collided with the rear of the appellant's stationary vehicle.  There was a dispute concerning the following matters:
(i) The interval of time between the collision with the McCaw vehicle and the second collision.  The appellant asserted that the second collision occurred two or three seconds at most after the first collision and that she did not and could not move from her seat during that short time.  Messrs Josie McCaw and Perkins gave evidence that there was a longer interval between the two collisions, probably two minutes.  (The third occupant of the McCaw vehicle was affected by mental illness at the time of trial.  It was agreed that his evidence would not be relied on by either party.)  
(ii) Was the appellant in her vehicle at the time of the second collision?
11The appellant asserted that she did not alight from her vehicle after the first collision but prepared herself, anticipating that her vehicle would be struck from behind.  If her evidence were accepted, there was insufficient time for her to move from her seat after the first impact before the second impact.
12Messrs McCaw and Perkins said that they alighted from the utility and that the appellant alighted from her vehicle after the two collided, but well before the respondent's minibus collided with the rear of the appellant's van.  They gave evidence that the appellant was engaged in conversation with them at the side of the Freeway at the time the respondent collided with the rear of her van.
13The respondent and his wife gave evidence that they observed a group of four persons standing together by the side of the Freeway before the respondent's minibus collided with the appellant's van.  The appellant was identified as one of that group at the side of the Freeway.
14It was common ground that before taking statements from the respondent and his wife, an investigator, Mr Shore, told them that the McCaw brothers and Mr Perkins were asserting that the appellant was outside her vehicle at the time of the second collision.  It was also common ground that this investigator did not interview the respondent and his wife separately, but together.  Statements were obtained by that investigator from the respondent and his wife.
15There were earlier proceedings in the District Court which resulted in a judgment in favour of the appellant.  On appeal (Shimokawa v Lewis [2009] NSWCA 266) that judgment was set aside and the matter was returned to the District Court for a new trial on all issues.  The proceedings now appealed from constituted the retrial.  
Proceedings in the District Court and the findings of the trial judge
16His Honour identified the fundamental question as whether or not the appellant was in her car at the time of the second collision.  To answer that question, he identified three subsidiary issues:
(a) What was the force of the impact in the first collision?(b) An assessment of the appellant's evidence by a comparison with the evidence of those witnesses called on behalf of the respondent.(c) The extent to which there was corroborative evidence supporting the appellant.
17In determining those questions, his Honour was mindful of the seriousness of the issues under consideration and made specific reference to Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336, Palmer v Dolman [2005] NSWCA 361 and Director General of Department of Community Services, Re Sophie [2008] NSWCA 250.
18In relation to the force of the impact in the first collision, his Honour reviewed the evidence of the appellant, her former husband Mr Lewis, and the persons in the McCaw vehicle.  His Honour noted the following evidence from the appellant, both in chief and cross-examination:
""Q.  Whereabouts on your vehicle and whereabouts on his vehicle did the collision occur?A.  I actually slid straight into his tow bar.
Q.  Are you able to estimate what sort of speed you were doing when you impacted into the rear of his vehicle?A.  I can't say exactly what speed I was doing at that time.  I remember when I was coming through I was only doing about 40, 45 k's before I broke.  So I would have, I would think, slowed down.
Q.  What sort of impact did it feel like to you?A.  I literally just bumped into his towbar.  
Q.  With any force or not?A.  Not much at all."" (Black 13M)
""Q.  When you hit your brakes the wheels locked and you slid?A.  Yes.
Q.  And so you weren't able to reduce your speed greatly before sliding into the rear of Mr McCaw, were you?A.  Well, I don't know exactly what speed I was doing, no.
Q.  Well you've estimated as best you can 40 to 45 kilometres an hour?A.  That was the speed that I was doing yes before I hit the brakes.""  (Black 65H)
""Q.  Well when you say ""just tapped it"", you hadn't actually reduced your speed much below 40 to 45 kilometres an hour, had you?A.  I really don't know.  I wasn't looking at my speedo at the time.
Q.  I fully accept that but --A.  Yeah.
Q.  You had hit the brakes hard at 40 to 45?A.  Yes.
Q.  And slid on the wet road?A.  Yes.
Q.  So the speed of the car no doubt reduced, but not by much.  Would you agree?A.  Probably not, yes.""  (Black 66H)
19Mr Perkins did not think that the impact had been particularly great because there was no damage to the McCaw vehicle and after 7 years he had no clear recollection of the extent of the impact.  He did remember that the appellant's vehicle had sustained more damage than the McCaw vehicle.  The evidence of Mr Josie McCaw was that the impact was not particularly great but that the bumper bar of the van had gone through the tow ball of the Rodeo.
20Evidence was given by Mr Lewis about a phone call which he had with the appellant an hour or so after the collision when she had been allowed to depart by the police.  In cross-examination it was clear that his recollection was hazy about what he had been told by her.  His evidence was:
""Q.  Might she have said ""I relaxed and sighed after I struck the towbar of the car in front""?A.  I just remember her saying that she'd - I would be proud of her because I taught her how to drive and basically when she seen the ute stopping quite quickly in front, she jammed her brakes on, it locked up but she was able to relax and remember how I taught her to sort of release the brake and go again she had just slid in and bumped against the tow ball of the car in front.""  (Black 185R)
His Honour did not regard the evidence of Mr Lewis as particularly useful in assessing the extent of the first collision.
21His Honour concluded that the best evidence on this issue came from the appellant.  He said:
""Given that the plaintiff had expressly estimated her speed (between 40 to 45 kph) and given a clear estimation of the distance between her vehicle and that of the McCaw vehicle immediately before impact (one to one and a half vehicle lengths), the plaintiff has not proved on the balance of probabilities that the first impact was not an insignificant one.""  (Red 44L)
22His Honour also took into account the evidence of Dr Conrad, the only doctor to give evidence on this issue:
""Q.  Would it be fair to say that your experience has taught you that sometimes a minor impact can lead to a major injury?A.  It can.
Q.  Sometimes a major impact can lead to no injury or a very minor injury?A.  That's correct.
Q.  Is that the reason why you properly don't regard it as part of your function to try and sort out which impact might have caused injury?A.  That's right.
Q.  Because it would be medically imprudent to do so?A.  Yes.""  (Black 224W)
23On the basis of that material, his Honour found:
""Accordingly, on the basis of Dr Conrad's evidence, the plaintiff's assumed injuries could have been sustained by the first collision.  Those assumed injuries therefore are not independently corroborative of the plaintiff's evidence that she was in her vehicle at the time of the second accident.""  (Red 44S)
24His Honour then reviewed the evidence concerning the appellant's presence in the van at the time of the second collision.  His Honour found the appellant to be a not particularly impressive witness, insofar as demeanour was concerned.  Nevertheless, his Honour did not place particular weight on that consideration, although he did not entirely disregard it. 
25His Honour summarised the appellant's evidence concerning the second collision.  The appellant said that having collided with the McCaw vehicle, she expected a further collision and accordingly, braced herself by holding onto the steering wheel.  She said that within two or three seconds, a second impact occurred with the respondent's vehicle.  She described that impact as ""a big force"", ""a huge force"".  She said that the force of the impact was such that she was lifted off her seat and that her head hit the roof of the van.  She said that she was quite shaken by the impact.
26The appellant said that after she had collected her cigarettes, she observed the three occupants of the McCaw vehicle walking towards her in the left-hand traffic lane.  She got out of her car and had a conversation with them and smoked cigarettes, initially standing beside her van in the left-hand traffic lane, but then moving to the front of the van.  She also had a brief conversation with the respondent who was taking photographs.  
27His Honour considered that there were aspects of the appellant's evidence which were unsatisfactory.  
28The matters specifically identified by his Honour were:
(i) Her evidence as to whether and when she had read the transcript of her evidence given in the previous hearing.  His Honour characterised that evidence as improbable and evasive.
(ii) Her evidence concerning whether she had a pre-existing injury, which was still being treated in 2003.  The appellant said that she did not.  She accepted that she had suffered a back injury in July 2001 which had been symptomatic for about six months, but thereafter it had resolved.  That evidence was inconsistent with the records of her general practitioner, Dr Low, which referred to eight - nine months of massage without relief as of March 2002 and treatment by a physiotherapist thereafter.  There was evidence of the appellant receiving chiropractic treatment for her back as of the date of the accident.  The appellant sought to explain the note of Dr Low by saying that this was a reference to ""rubbing"" performed by her husband.  His Honour characterised the appellant's responses to these issues as unsatisfactory and deliberately evasive.
(iii) The content of a workers compensation claim form.  In it the appellant declared ""to the best of her knowledge and belief [its content] was true and correct in every detail"".  Under the section concerning witnesses to the incident she had written ""I only have the man who actually hit me"" and then the name and details of the respondent were set out.  No reference was made to anyone in the McCaw vehicle, although it was clear that the appellant was aware of their names and details.  His Honour found that her explanation as to why she did not provide this information was implausible.
(iv) At the previous trial, when giving evidence as to domestic assistance provided to her, she had made no mention of assistance which she was then receiving from her partner, Mr Witt.  In this trial, a significant claim for unpaid domestic assistance was based on the assistance provided by Mr Witt.  His Honour characterised the appellant's explanation for why she did not refer to the assistance provided by Mr Witt in the first trial as improbable.
29Taking all of those matters together, and having regard to the demeanour issue, his Honour said:
""I have concerns about the reliability of the plaintiff's evidence generally and in particular on the immediately relevant issue for resolution"".
30His Honour then reviewed the evidence of the respondent's witnesses. 
31Mr Josie McCaw gave evidence that he had driven into the breakdown lane in order to avoid colliding with a vehicle in front of him when the appellant's van collided with the rear of his vehicle.  He said that he, his brother Andrew, and Mr Perkins exited their vehicle and went to examine the damage.  As they were doing this, the appellant stood beside them so that all four were standing in the breakdown lane.  He said that when the respondent's vehicle approached, all of them jumped over the guardrail.
32At the time of the accident in 2003, Mr Perkins was aged 17.  He was a backseat passenger in the McCaw vehicle.  He gave evidence that after the collision with the appellant's vehicle, he was standing with the appellant and the McCaw brothers immediately before the second collision.
33Josie McCaw and Mr Perkins were cross-examined to the effect that they were being deliberately dishonest when they said that the appellant was standing with them outside her vehicle at the time of the second collision.  His Honour rejected that submission because there was no advantage to them in giving anything other than truthful evidence.  They were total strangers, as far as the appellant and the respondent were concerned.
34The second challenge to the evidence of Messrs McCaw and Perkins was that their recollections had been contaminated because they had discussed the events of that particular day with each other, and with others.  Both witnesses freely admitted that in the months following the accident, such discussions had taken place.  His Honour noted that when the content of those discussions was tested, it became clear that what had been discussed was not the accident involving the appellant, but the rescue of another driver in which they had participated at some considerable risk to themselves.
35In re-examination Mr McCaw gave the following evidence:
""Q.  There's just one matter I want to raise with you Mr McCaw.  You may remember Mr Lidden drawing your attention to the period of months after the accident?A.  Yep.
Q.  During which you said that you and your brother explained the accident to others?A.  Yes.
Q.  What aspects of the accident did you talk about when you explained it to others during the months following the accident itself?A.  Mainly taking the bloke out of the Escort.  There was all petrol on the road and he was bleeding from his head and everything like that.  More - more of them sort of things yeah.
Q.  Were you at that time discussing anything to do with Miss Lewis?A.  No because that was all clear.""  (Black 518N)
36His Honour was satisfied that there had not been any relevant contamination of recollection on the part of those witnesses.
37The third challenge to their evidence concerned the differences between some aspects of their evidence.  For example, while they both agreed that the appellant was standing with them outside her vehicle at the time of the impact by the respondent's vehicle, they had her at a different position by reference to her vehicle.
38His Honour did not find such differences to be remarkable and considered that they were to be expected after more than 7 years had passed.  His Honour concluded:
""88 Those differences, however, do not lead me to doubt the accuracy of their recollections about the incident involving the plaintiff and, more particularly, where she was physically placed between the two relevant collisions.""  (Red 59N)
39The fourth challenge to their evidence concerned demeanour.  This related to what was described as ""some terse exchanges between those witnesses and the cross-examiner"".
40His Honour rejected that criticism of their evidence.  He regarded them as unsophisticated young men with no previous experience of courtrooms.  In those circumstances, his Honour did not find their responses to be inappropriate.  On the contrary, he found them to be ""impressive witnesses"" (Red 60L).
41His Honour reviewed the evidence of the respondent's wife, who was a front seat passenger in the respondent's vehicle.  She said that as the fog cleared, she saw that they were approaching the appellant's vehicle.  She noticed a group of three men and a woman standing between it and the guardrail.  She described the woman as having long hair and wearing white Bermuda shorts with a dark top.  This was an accurate description of the appellant.  She said that the impact with the appellant's vehicle was not very forceful.  She alighted from the vehicle, went up to the group and asked if anyone was hurt.  Having received a negative answer, she then specifically asked about the driver of the van to which one of the group replied ""The driver's here"" and indicated the appellant.
42The respondent's wife was cross-examined extensively concerning the interview with the investigator, whether she had discussed the accident with her husband and whether she had refreshed her memory from statements and photographs taken at the time.  In was suggested to her that her evidence was untrue and that she had given such evidence out of a sense of importance.
43While his Honour was concerned at the impropriety associated with the way in which the investigator obtained statements from the respondent and his wife, he was very impressed by her as a witness.  He was particularly impressed by her reaction when she learned for the first time that the appellant was claiming to have been in the vehicle when the second collision occurred.  Under cross-examination, the following exchange took place:
""Q.  He told you that didn't he?A.  Yes.  What I remember him telling us was that she said that she was in the car and I was shocked by that.""  (Black 331H)
""Q.  That was the first time about five years after this accident that you had any thought about whether she was in the van isn't it?A.  No it's not.  I was shocked to find that she said that she was.  That's what shocked me.  I couldn't believe she said she was in the car.
Q.  You were shocked?A.  Yes.""  (Black 331U)
44His Honour concluded:
""Indeed the longer the cross-examination continued the more I was impressed by the witness.  Ultimately therefore I found her evidence to be reliable on the fundamental issue of where the plaintiff was at the time of the impact between her vehicle and the defendant.""  (Red 62S)
This was a finding clearly based not only upon the effect of the evidence but on demeanour.
45His Honour did not reach the same conclusion in relation to the respondent.  The respondent's evidence was that after the collision he approached a group of four people, standing next to the guardrail, and exchanged details with the appellant and took photographs of the scene.
46His Honour found that the respondent's response to cross-examination was to become overly defensive.  His Honour was not satisfied that the respondent necessarily had an independent recollection of aspects of his evidence.  Ultimately, his Honour did not reject the evidence of the respondent because it was corroborated by the other three witnesses.  Nevertheless, his Honour made it clear that he did not regard the respondent as an impressive witness.
47His Honour's conclusion was:
""105 The plaintiff has failed to discharge the onus of proof of establishing that on the balance of probabilities she was in her vehicle at the time of the collision with the defendant's vehicle.  Indeed I am satisfied positively on the balance of probabilities by having regard to the totality of the evidence that she was not.""  (Red 65E)
Submissions and consideration
48Before setting out and examining the competing submissions, it is useful to review the principles which this Court has to apply given the strong factual findings by the trial judge.  In this regard, Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 continues to be the most recent and comprehensive statement of principle.  
""23 The foregoing procedure shapes the requirements, and limitations, of such an appeal. On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to ""give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance"". On the other, it must, of necessity, observe the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the ""feeling"" of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.
...
25 Within the constraints marked out by the nature of the appellate process, the appellate court is obliged to conduct a real review of the trial and, in cases where the trial was conducted before a judge sitting alone, of that judge's reasons. Appellate courts are not excused from the task of ""weighing conflicting evidence and drawing [their] own inferences and conclusions, though [they] should always bear in mind that [they have] neither seen nor heard the witnesses, and should make due allowance in this respect"". In Warren v Coombes, the majority of this Court reiterated the rule that: 
""[I]n general an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to decide on the proper inference to be drawn from facts which are undisputed or which, having been disputed, are established by the findings of the trial judge. In deciding what is the proper inference to be drawn, the appellate court will give respect and weight to the conclusion of the trial judge but, once having reached its own conclusion, will not shrink from giving effect to it."" 
As this Court there said, that approach was ""not only sound in law, but beneficial in ... operation"".
26 After Warren v Coombes, a series of cases was decided in which this Court reiterated its earlier statements concerning the need for appellate respect for the advantages of trial judges, and especially where their decisions might be affected by their impression about the credibility of witnesses whom the trial judge sees but the appellate court does not. Three important decisions in this regard were Jones v Hyde, Abalos v Australian Postal Commission and Devries v Australian National Railways Commission. This trilogy of cases did not constitute a departure from established doctrine. The decisions were simply a reminder of the limits under which appellate judges typically operate when compared with trial judges.
...
28 Over more than a century, this Court, and courts like it, have given instruction on how to resolve the dichotomy between the foregoing appellate obligations and appellate restraint. From time to time, by reference to considerations particular to each case, different emphasis appears in such reasons. However, the mere fact that a trial judge necessarily reached a conclusion favouring the witnesses of one party over those of another does not, and cannot, prevent the performance by a court of appeal of the functions imposed on it by statute. In particular cases incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony will demonstrate that the trial judge's conclusions are erroneous, even when they appear to be, or are stated to be, based on credibility findings.
29 That this is so is demonstrated in several recent decisions of this Court. In some, quite rare, cases, although the facts fall short of being ""incontrovertible"", an appellate conclusion may be reached that the decision at trial is ""glaringly improbable"" or ""contrary to compelling inferences"" in the case. In such circumstances, the appellate court is not relieved of its statutory functions by the fact that the trial judge has, expressly or implicitly, reached a conclusion influenced by an opinion concerning the credibility of witnesses. In such a case, making all due allowances for the advantages available to the trial judge, the appellate court must ""not shrink from giving effect to"" its own conclusion. Finality in litigation is highly desirable. Litigation beyond a trial is costly and usually upsetting. But in every appeal by way of rehearing, a judgment of the appellate court is required both on the facts and the law.  It is not forbidden (nor in the face of the statutory requirement could it be) by ritual incantation about witness credibility, nor by judicial reference to the desirability of finality in litigation or reminders of the general advantages of the trial over the appellate process. (Gleeson CJ; Gummow and Kirby JJ)

90 It is a serious mistake to think that anything said in Abalos or Devries necessarily prevents an appellate court from reversing a trial judge's finding when it is based, expressly or inferentially, on demeanour. Those cases recognise - in accordance with a long line of authority - that it may be done. But there must be something that points decisively and not merely persuasively to error on the part of the trial judge in acting on his or her impressions of the witness or witnesses. Recently in State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) for example, this Court held that undisputed and documentary evidence was so convincing that no reliance on the demeanour of witnesses could rebut it.""  (McHugh J)
Ground 1 - The trial judge's reasons failed to disclose a logical or adequate reasoning process.
49This ground of appeal was directed to his Honour's finding (Red 50J) that there were aspects of the appellant's evidence which he found to be ""unsatisfactory"" and to his acceptance of the evidence of Mr McCaw, Mr Perkins and Mrs Shimokawa.  
50With respect to her own evidence, the appellant made submissions under the following headings:DemeanourReading of the transcriptPrevious massage therapyDr Low's clinical notesWorkers Compensation ClaimDomestic Assistance
Demeanour
51The appellant submitted that the demeanour matters referred to by his Honour did not support a finding that she was being untruthful.  That submission is correct.  It does not, however, accurately reflect what his Honour said. 
52In the context of evidence from the appellant that since the accident her leg would shake when she was under stress, his Honour noted that her leg appeared to shake when she was giving evidence in chief but that there was no such shaking when she was being cross-examined.  Despite that observation, his Honour was not prepared to place ""undue weight"" on it, although he was not prepared to entirely disregard it.  
53There was no error on the part of his Honour in this approach and it is clear from the whole judgment that this observation made a minor contribution, if any, to his Honour's conclusion in relation to the appellant's evidence.
Reading of the transcript
54The appellant submitted that there was no basis for his Honour to find that when questioned about whether she had read the transcript of evidence given by her in the earlier District Court proceedings, her responses had been evasive.  I do not agree.  The relevant cross-examination took place at Black 50W-52H.  A fair reading of that part of the appellant's evidence fully supports his Honour's conclusion.  Instead of agreeing with the cross-examiner (as was the fact) that she had read the transcript before giving her evidence, she prevaricated and was evasive in her responses.
Previous Massage therapy
55The appellant was cross-examined to the effect that a back injury suffered at work in July 2001 was not minor and that she was still receiving treatment for it at the time of the accident.  The appellant was cross-examined as to evidence which she gave in the previous trial and in this trial.  Her evidence was that she had only been troubled with back symptoms for some six or seven months from July 2001.  In the earlier trial she denied that she had undergone any massage treatment thereafter and in this trial, said that her husband would from time to time massage her back (Black 49R).
56There was evidence in the appellant's case from Mr Wheatley, her employer in 2001, that he could only recall her receiving treatment for her back for about six months.  There was evidence from Mr Lewis that the appellant had only been troubled with back problems for six months.  The appellant submitted that his Honour made no reference to this corroborative evidence when drawing adverse inferences in respect of the appellant.  She submitted that in the overall context of the evidence, her responses did not adversely reflect on her credit.
57There was a considerable body of documentary material which was contrary to the evidence given by the appellant.  On 20 March 2002 Dr Low referred the appellant to a physiotherapist, Mr Middleton.  The letter of referral referred to ""thoracic spine/paravertebral strain 8 - 9 months of massage: no relief"".  Mr Middleton provided physiotherapy treatment in accordance with the letter of referral between April 2002 and June 2002.  A document completed by the appellant on 9 April 2002 (exhibit D, Blue 13) indicated that as of that date she was still suffering significant symptoms in her low back.  The appellant was undergoing monthly chiropractic treatment for her low back at the time of the accident on 21 November 2003.  Her evidence was that these chiropractic sessions were for ""maintenance"" purposes and not because she was experiencing symptoms.
58When cross-examined on these documents and on this issue, it would be fair to say that the appellant's responses were contradictory and inconsistent.  His Honour's finding that the appellant's responses were evasive was well open to him.
Dr Low's clinical notes
59The appellant submitted that it was not open to his Honour to rely upon his own understanding of the records of Dr Low in preference to her evidence as to their meaning.  The appellant submitted that in the absence of oral evidence from Dr Low, his Honour was not entitled to reject her evidence that the massage referred to was that provided by her husband.
60The description of treatment by Dr Low in his letter of referral was clear and by reference to the other evidence concerning treatment provided for the appellant (particularly the report of Mr Middleton at Blue 26), his Honour was entitled to give to the letter of referral from Dr Low its normal and obvious meaning.
Workers compensation claim
61His Honour found that the appellant's explanation as to why she had omitted to provide details of the McCaw witnesses in her workers compensation claim form to be implausible.  The appellant's explanation was that following the accident when she tried to contact Mr McCaw, his mother had spoken aggressively to her.  She submitted that this provided an explanation for the contents of the workers compensation form and that there was no proper basis for his Honour to make the finding which he did.
62Despite the requirement in the claim form that she provide information ""to the best of her knowledge and belief [which] was true and correct in every detail"", the appellant wrote on the form ""I only have the man who actually hit me as a witness"" and then set out the name and address of the respondent.  At the time when she completed that form, the appellant was aware that there were at least three other witnesses, being the McCaw brothers and Mr Perkins.
63In those circumstances, it was open to his Honour to find that the appellant's explanation for failing to provide full contact details was unsatisfactory and improbable.  Even if Mr McCaw's mother had been hostile, that was no reason to withhold witness details of which she was aware.  His Honour did not err in making the finding which he did.
Domestic assistance
64In the earlier trial (September 2008), the appellant gave evidence of domestic assistance received by her from family and friends as a result of the accident.  In that trial, she made no mention of any assistance received from Mr Witt (her current partner).  She and Mr Witt had commenced living together in April - May 2008.  In this trial, a substantial part of the appellant's claim for domestic assistance related to services provided by Mr Witt.  His Honour found the appellant's explanation as to why she had made no reference to Mr Witt in the earlier trial to be improbable.  The appellant submitted that there was no basis for that finding.
65The evidence on this issue is at Black 110S-113Q.  The appellant's explanation for why she had not given this evidence in the earlier trial was that she had not been specifically asked and at the time she was trying to do more housework herself.  This explanation was inconsistent with the applicant's evidence as to the extensive assistance provided by Mr Witt (Black 38T) and the evidence of Mr Witt to the effect that the appellant was not capable of stirring a pot of liquid without significant pain (Black 205S-206T).  In the earlier trial the appellant was asked and had given evidence as to domestic assistance which she was receiving up to and including the date of that trial. In those circumstances, it was open to his Honour to make the finding which he did.
66It follows from the above analysis that there was ample evidence, both in relation to the individual matters and cumulatively, to support his Honour's conclusion as to the unsatisfactory nature of some of the evidence of the appellant.  The appellant's challenge to his Honour's reasoning on this issue has not been made out.
His Honour's analysis of the respondent's witnesses
67The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in his acceptance of the evidence of Mr Perkins in that his Honour did not have adequate regard to his evidence that he did not care what he told the investigators and that he had only a limited recollection of the circumstances surrounding the accident.  The appellant submitted that his Honour should have been more critical of the fact that those details which Mr Perkins did remember supported the evidence of Mr Josie McCaw and were adverse to the appellant.  The appellant submitted that his Honour did not have adequate regard to the differences in evidence between Mr Josie McCaw and Mr Perkins, in particular as to where the appellant was at the time of the second collision.  The appellant submitted that there was no proper basis disclosed by his Honour for finding that both Mr Perkins and  Mr Josie McCaw were ""impressive"" witnesses, other than that they had steadfastly adhered to their evidence under heavy cross-examination.
68The difficulty for the appellant is that such submissions of their nature cannot overcome considered credit and demeanour findings, such as were made by the trial judge in this case.  What has to be shown is that his Honour's acceptance of the evidence of these witnesses was inconsistent with other incontrovertible facts or that the acceptance of their evidence was ""glaringly improbable"" or ""contrary to compelling inferences"".  That has not been done.
69While it is true that there was a discrepancy between the evidence of Mr Perkins and that of Mr McCaw as to where the appellant was standing at the time of the second collision, their evidence on the crucial issue of whether the appellant was outside her vehicle was the same.  What clearly emerged from the evidence of both Mr Perkins and Josie McCaw was that both were reluctant witnesses in the sense that they were impatient with the fact that the insurance company required them to give evidence and that they had no personal interest in the outcome of the trial.  Specifically,  no motive was identified as to why they would give evidence contrary to the interests of the appellant.  On the contrary, it was clear that they both bore some hostility towards the insurance company and its investigators.  It is clear that his Honour took those matters into account, as well as his findings as to demeanour when accepting their evidence.  The appellant's challenge to their evidence under this ground of appeal has not been made out.
70The appellant challenged the evidence of Mrs Shimokawa on the basis that it had been contaminated by the actions of the insurance investigator who attended to obtain a statement from her and the respondent.  The nature of the contamination was that the investigator had interviewed both Mrs Shimokawa and the respondent together and that before taking a statement from them, he advised that the persons in the McCaw vehicle were saying that the appellant was not in her vehicle at the time of the second collision.
71Both at trial and in this appeal, the respondent accepted that the behaviour of the investigator had been wrong and inappropriate.  Mrs Shimokawa was cross-examined on the basis that her evidence had been contaminated and that she had no independent recollection of the circumstances of the accident.  She unqualifiedly rejected those challenges.  She was also cross-examined on the basis that her recollection after such a long time was defective and that it was the information conveyed by the investigator, that the McCaw witnesses would say that the appellant was not in her vehicle, which led to Mrs Shimokawa giving evidence to similar effect.  
72Not only did Mrs Shimokawa reject that latter proposition but she did so in terms which particularly impressed the trial judge.  The effect of her evidence was that when she was told by the investigator that the appellant was asserting that she had been in her vehicle at the time of the second collision, she was shocked.  The basis for that shock became clear as the cross-examination progressed.  She was not shocked because the appellant was asserting that she had been injured when at the time of the accident she had denied any such injury, but rather that the appellant was asserting that she was inside her vehicle when the clear recollection of Mrs Shimokawa was that she was one of the four people standing by the vehicle at the time of impact.
73It is clear from his Honour's treatment of the evidence of Mrs Shimokawa that he was mindful of the possibility of contamination because of the conduct of the investigator.  For that reason he carefully assessed it.  Having done so, his Honour was unequivocal in his acceptance of that evidence and in his assessment of Mrs Shimokawa as an impressive and accurate witness.  As with the evidence of Messrs Perkins and McCaw, no incontrovertible facts nor other considerations have been identified which would render her evidence ""glaringly improbable"" or ""contrary to compelling inferences"" otherwise available.
74This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The trial judge's finding that the impact between the appellant's vehicle and the McCaw vehicle was not ""an insignificant one"" was not based on the evidence given at trial and the reasoning is inadequate and contradictory.
75The importance of this issue is that if his Honour's finding were open on the evidence, it provided an explanation for how the appellant could have suffered injury without being in her vehicle at the time of the second collision.  It was an important part of the appellant's case at trial and on appeal that there was a substantial body of medical opinion to the effect she had suffered a significant injury at the time of the accident and that this provided objective corroboration of the fact that she must have been in her vehicle at the time of the second collision.
76The appellant submitted that his Honour's finding on this issue was defective in that he had placed too much weight on his interpretation of the appellant's evidence and had given insufficient weight to the evidence of Messrs Perkins and McCaw as to the minor nature of the first collision.  The appellant noted that Mr Perkins could not remember an impact and could not recall whether the vehicles were in contact.  The appellant submitted that the evidence relied upon by his Honour was too imprecise to enable him to make the finding which he did, in particular that his Honour had failed to take into account that at the time the McCaw vehicle was first observed by the appellant, it was still moving.
77The appellant estimated her speed before braking to avoid a collision with the McCaw vehicle at 40-45 kmh (Black 13P, 63U).  She estimated that she was only 1.5 car lengths behind the McCaw vehicle when she emerged from a patch of fog and saw that it was braking heavily (Black 64V).  The appellant said that she applied her brakes hard, but slid on the wet road (Black 65C).  The appellant was unable to estimate her speed at the time her vehicle collided with the towbar attached to the rear of the McCaw vehicle.  There was evidence that the towbar of the McCaw vehicle had gone through the front bumper of the appellant's vehicle.  Although the damage to the McCaw vehicle was minor, the appellant's van stopped abruptly when the impact occurred (Black 66D).
78The evidence relied upon by his Honour was sufficient to support his conclusion that the impact with the McCaw vehicle was not ""an insignificant one"".  It is clear from their evidence that Mr Perkins and Mr McCaw were more concerned with the damage to their vehicle than with an assessment of the damage to the appellant's vehicle.  The person in the best position to assess the extent of the impact was the appellant and his Honour was entitled to rely upon her evidence.  (See [18] - [21] hereof.)
Ground 3 - The trial judge erred in failing to find that the injuries suffered by the appellant corroborated the fact that she was in the vehicle at the time the respondent's vehicle impacted with it.
79The appellant submitted that if it were accepted that the first collision was slight and the second collision was forceful, then common sense would suggest that the appellant was seriously injured in the second collision.  The appellant submitted that the evidence of Dr Conrad, relied upon by his Honour, should be disregarded since it was based upon hypothetical propositions and to the extent that evidence in the case was put before Dr Conrad, it was misstated.
80I do not agree that the evidence of Dr Conrad was based on purely hypothetical propositions and that it was unrelated to the evidence.  On the contrary, the clear effect of the evidence of Dr Conrad was that there was no necessary correlation between the severity of an impact and the severity of an injury which followed from it.  Sometimes a minor impact could lead to a major injury and sometimes a major impact could lead to a very minor injury, or no injury at all.  Accordingly, the evidence of Dr Conrad supports the proposition that the first collision could have caused the appellant's injuries.
81The issue can be looked at in another way.  If it is accepted that the appellant was in her vehicle for the first collision, but was not in her vehicle for the second collision but still suffered the serious injury of which she complains, the evidence of Dr Conrad is fully supportive of the first collision causing that injury.
82There is another consideration which was not adverted to by his Honour but which is of relevance.  On the basis of the history of the appellant being in her vehicle at the time of the second collision, the doctors who examined her concluded that the disabilities of which she complained were due to that collision.  That diagnosis largely depended upon an acceptance of the accuracy of the history and symptoms described by the appellant.  The only objective medical sign which was found on an examination of the appellant was ""a mild localised disc protrusion"" at the C6/6-7 in an MRI scan of 23 August 2004.  Such a finding could have a traumatic or non-traumatic cause.  It is the history provided by the appellant which linked that finding to the disabilities of which she complains.  In other words, the medical diagnosis of the appellant depended largely upon her being accepted as an accurate and honest historian.
83This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 4 - The trial judge erred in failing to find that the contemporaneous reports and complaints made by the appellant corroborated that she was in the vehicle at the time of the accident.
84The contemporaneous reports upon which the appellant relies were:
(i) The conversation which she had with her then husband, Mr Lewis, on the night of the accident.
(ii) The report which she made to her then employer, Mr Wheatley, at the time of the accident and his observation the next day that she was in pain and upset.
(iii) The observation of Mrs Wheatley on the day after the accident that the appellant was in pain and upset.
(iv) The description of the accident in the workers compensation claim form, completed on 4 December 2003.
85The appellant submitted that his Honour did not refer to this corroborative evidence and therefore his finding that the appellant was not in her vehicle at the time of the second collision miscarried.
86The evidence relied upon by the appellant is not entirely independent.  Mr Lewis had been her husband and Mr Wheatley was her uncle by marriage.  While the evidence of Mr Lewis in chief corroborated the appellant's evidence in respect of the second collision, under cross-examination he was much less sure of what the appellant had told him.  The following exchange took place at Black 186G:
""Q.  She might simply have said ""Later someone came and hit the back of my van"".  Would you agree?A.  She could have yes.""
87The evidence of Mr and Mrs Wheatley is inconsistent with the appellant telling the McCaw group and Mrs Shimokawa at the scene of the accident that she had not been injured and is inconsistent with the COPS record of her report to the police on the day following the accident, which included a notation that no-one had been injured.
88In the workers compensation claim form, the description of the accident refers to the second collision occurring ""less than a second later"" which is inconsistent with the appellant's evidence of bracing herself in anticipation of a second collision occurring.
89Putting the appellant's case at its highest, these contemporaneous statements all emanate from the appellant and indicate no more than that the appellant had decided to say that she was in her vehicle at the time of the second accident at an early point in time.  One can only speculate as to her motive in doing so.  In that regard, the workers compensation claim form may provide some assistance.  Because most of the damage to the appellant's vehicle was caused by the second collision, she may have thought that it was better to rely upon that incident when making her claim for compensation.  It is also not without significance that it is this claim form which contains the misleading information concerning witnesses to the accident.
90If these contemporaneous statements were made as the appellant submitted, they do not amount to evidence that ""points decisively not merely persuasively to error on the part of the trial judge in acting on his or her impressions of the witness or witnesses"".  (McHugh J in Fox v Percy).  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 5 - The trial judge failed to adequately take into account the gravity of the allegation being made when reaching his conclusion that the appellant had for a prolonged period of time been guilty of fraudulent conduct.
91The appellant submitted that his Honour did not properly appreciate the seriousness and consequences of his finding in relation to the appellant's claim and that no proper foundation had been laid for such a finding.
92His Honour well appreciated the seriousness of the finding which he was being asked to make and at Red 25-26 specifically considered the evidentiary onus carried by the respondent and the necessity for the Briginshaw standard of proof to be satisfied.  It is clear from his Honour's judgment that in accepting the evidence of Mr Josie McCaw, Mr Perkins, Mrs Shimokawa and the respondent, and in rejecting that of the appellant, he not only had that standard in mind but applied it.  No error in the standard of proof applied by his Honour has been demonstrated.
Ground 6 - In assessing the evidence of the witnesses called by the respondent the trial judge failed to have any or any adequate regard to the evidence of Dr Helen Paterson, particularly in circumstances where the respondent called no evidence to rebut it.
93The appellant submitted that although his Honour admitted a redacted version of the report of Dr Paterson into evidence, he had little regard to it.  The appellant submitted that the report of Dr Paterson provided an explanation for how the respondent's witnesses could have been mistaken in their evidence although genuinely believing it to be true.  As such it was necessary for his Honour to take into account the important matters set out in that report when assessing the evidence of those witnesses.  The appellant submitted that his Honour's failure to do so invalidated or substantially weakened the effect of his acceptance of their evidence.
94The appellant submitted that the evidence of Mr Perkins that he had discussed the accident over the preceding three years and that for many years no-one had asked him to turn his mind to the location of the female driver of the van, was the sort of situation to which Dr Paterson referred.  The evidence of Mr McCaw was to similar effect.  The appellant submitted that the evidence of Mrs Shimokawa and the respondent had been contaminated by the methodology used in obtaining statements from them and provided good examples of the matters specifically referred to by Dr Paterson in her report.
95The appellant submitted that when one took into account the report of Dr Paterson, it was clear that all the respondent's witnesses would have been at a heightened risk of significant memory contamination by reason of their discussions with one another and with investigators in relation to one aspect of an event which they were asked to recall many years after it had occurred.  Since there was no evidence called to rebut Dr Paterson's report, it should have been given full force and effect by his Honour.  His Honour's failure to do so substantially weakened his acceptance of the respondent's witnesses.
96Dr Helen Paterson is a lecturer in forensic psychology at the University of Sydney.  The parts of her report which were admitted set out the results of her research, and the research of others, as to the possible sources of contamination of eye witness evidence.  This comprised:
Post event misinformation.Leading questions by interviewers/investigators.Discussions between co-witnesses.
97According to Dr Paterson, information obtained in discussion with a co-witness was the most significant contaminant.  Misinformation introduced after a long delay was more likely to affect the recollection of an eye witness than misinformation closer to the event.
98Each of those matters is within the common experience of lawyers and judges.  It is doubtful whether the report adds anything to the usual approach adopted by courts to the assessment of oral evidence.  
99Although his Honour did not specifically refer to the report of Dr Paterson in the context of his analysis of the evidence of the respondent's witnesses, it is clear that his Honour was conscious of the risk of contamination of their evidence and that he carefully scrutinised it.  He specifically had regard to that consideration and rejected it.  In any event, the report of Dr Paterson went no further than to identify circumstances in which evidence may be contaminated.  It did not and could not assert that any of the evidence in this trial was contaminated.  Accordingly, there is nothing in the report which required rebuttal by the respondent.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 7 - Having found that the investigation processes of the respondent were inappropriate, the trial judge erred in placing little weight on that finding when accepting that the respondent's witnesses had a genuine recollection of the events in question, particularly in circumstances where the only common ground in their evidence was that the appellant was not in the vehicle at the relevant time.
Ground 8 - The trial judge failed to properly assess the implications of the fact that the respondent chose not to call evidence from the investigators whose conduct the trial judge found was inappropriate.
100These two grounds of appeal raise the same issue and can be dealt with together.  The appellant submitted that the value of the evidence of the respondent's witnesses was substantially devalued because the respondent did not call any of the investigators.  As a result, there was no evidence before the court as to:
(a) Which investigator spoke to which witnesses.
(b) What questions were asked by the investigators.
(c) What information or assumptions the investigators had shared between the two groups of witnesses.
(d) Whether witness statements obtained by the investigators were accurate accounts of what they had been told; and
(e) Why the investigators had failed to interview the respondent and Mrs Shimokawa separately.
101The appellant submitted that his Honour should have concluded that the evidence of the investigators would not have assisted the respondent.
102I do not agree that the evidence of the respondent's witnesses was weakened in the way submitted by the appellant because of the absence of evidence from the investigators.  The respondent conceded at trial and on appeal that the conduct of the investigator who interviewed the respondent and Mrs Shimokawa was inappropriate.  That concession was used at trial to cross-examine both the respondent and Mrs Shimokawa.  That consideration played a significant part in his Honour's assessment of the evidence of the respondent and Mrs Shimokawa.
103There is no evidence of any misbehaviour on the part of an investigator in relation to the evidence of Mr Perkins or Mr Josie McCaw.  On the contrary, it is apparent that those persons were actively avoiding any contact with an investigator.  Accordingly, it is speculative to submit that the evidence of an investigator would have eroded in any way the effect of the evidence of either Mr Perkins or Mr Josie McCaw.
104The matters identified by the appellant which she submitted the evidence of the investigators would have clarified, was in fact before the Court as a result of the cross-examination of the respondent and Mrs Shimokawa.  The particular investigator was identified.  The questions asked by him were apparent from the statements prepared.  The information provided by the investigator to those witnesses was before the Court when those witnesses gave their evidence.  The cross-examination of the respondent and Mrs Shimokawa, by reference to the statements obtained, revealed that while there were discrepancies between the statements and their oral evidence, the discrepancies were minor.  Finally, once it was conceded by the respondent that the manner in which he and Mrs Shimokawa had been interviewed was inappropriate, it mattered not why that had occurred.
105His Honour gave very close consideration to the credibility of the evidence of Mrs Shimokawa and the respondent.  His process of reasoning was careful and logical.  Significantly, his Honour was critical of aspects of the respondent's evidence.  Nevertheless, it was open to him to accept the evidence of Mrs Shimokawa without qualification, as he did.
106These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Conclusion
107The critical evidence of Mrs Shimokawa, Mr Josie McCaw, Mr Kevin Perkins and the respondent was that each of them independently observed the appellant standing outside her vehicle at the time of the second collision.  No basis has been put forward as to why that evidence should be regarded as ""glaringly improbable"" or ""contrary to compelling inferences"".  No incontrovertible facts have been identified which cut across that evidence.  Those witnesses were accidental participants in a major accident involving many vehicles, which no doubt left an indelible imprint on their memory.
108As his Honour appreciated, it would be astonishing if the recollections of the event of Mr Josie McCaw, Mr Kevin Perkins, Mrs Shimokawa and the respondent were all incorrect and all incorrect in the same critical detail, namely that each of them observed the appellant standing outside her vehicle at the time of the second collision.
109His Honour was entitled to make the assessment which he did of those witnesses.  Each of them endured lengthy cross-examination.  None of them resiled from the critical observation of the appellant's location at the time of the second collision.  As his Honour pointed out, the fact that there were minor inconsistencies in detail between their accounts of the event reinforces, rather than undermines, the credibility of their evidence.
110By way of contrast, the appellant had an obvious financial interest in alleging that she was within her vehicle at the time of the second collision.  Her conversations with friends and family members do not provide the compelling support for her version of events, such as would allow this Court to overturn the strong factual findings of the trial judge.
111The orders which I propose are:
(1) That the appeal be dismissed.(2) That the appellant pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.

		24 September 2012",2012-09-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2760152,Director of Public Prosecutions v Hetman [2012] NSWLC 8,"Judgment
REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1The defendant is charged pursuant to section 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 with 5 counts of giving false evidence before the Commission. The false evidence was given before an inquiry conducted by the Commission into corrupt conduct within Railcorp concerning the procurement of goods and services for track construction and maintenance. The maximum penalty for an offence against these provisions is 5 years imprisonment when dealt with on indictment.   Section 116 of the ICAC Act however requires that in the first instance prosecutions are to be brought to finality in the Local Court. The maximum available penalty in this jurisdiction is 2 years imprisonment. 
Facts 
2At the time of the inquiry the defendant held the position of Civil Engineer in the Asset Management Group of Railcorp. He had delegated authority to authorise expenditure and award contracts for work valued up to $30,000. In the course of his employment the offender formed a close personal relationship with Domenic Murdocca. Mr Murdocca is or was at the time a company director of a company engaged in civil engineering work. It appears from the agreed statement of facts tendered by the DPP that the defendant gave preferential treatment to Mr Murdocca and received corrupt payments either in money terms or services rendered in return. 
3He gave evidence before the Commission on 17 March 2008. He denied the allegations in answers to 5 direct questions. Later on the same day whilst still under oath he returned to the witness box and conceded he had been deliberately untruthful in his earlier evidence. On 19 April 2012, over 4 years after he had given the false evidence, he was charged with the offences now before me. The Court has been informed that no charges have been laid in respect of the corrupt receipt of moneys or benefits. 
Commencement of Proceedings
4The defendant was charged before the Court with the offences on 1 May 2012. The Court asked why it had taken over 4 years to bring proceedings against the offender. The solicitor for the DPP was unable to inform the court of any reason why there had been such a prolonged period between the giving of false evidence and its retraction and the laying of Court Attendance Notices. The issue of delay is a significant factor to be addressed in sentencing for these offences. I will return to it later in these remarks.
The Plea
5On 19 June 2012 the defendant entered a plea of guilty to all charges. The prosecution accepted a plea to a single charge for the purpose of sentencing with the 4 additional charges being placed on a Form 1 pursuant to section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ('the Act'). 
6The DPP concedes the defendant's pleas of guilty were entered at the first available opportunity. Given the acknowledgment by the offender on 17 March 2008 that his earlier evidence had been false it is difficult to contemplate the entry of anything other than a plea of guilty; however, relative to the date of commencement of proceedings I accept the plea is to be dealt with on the basis that in line with the decisions of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 it should attract a discount for the utilitarian value that is at the upper end of the range. I allow a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea. I categorize the degree of criminality as being towards the lower end of objective seriousness for this type of conduct.
Sentencing context 7Offences such as those committed by the offender have attracted a number of clear statements of principle. I note the comments made by James J in R v Einfeld [2009] NSWSC 119 at [183]:
""As has often been said, each of the offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice strikes at the heart of the administration of justice. These offences are often referred to as offences against public justice. In sentencing for these offences there is a special need to give effect to the purposes of sentencing of general deterrence and denunciation as well as the other purposes set out in S.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In the case of perjury a full time custodial sentence should be imposed unless there are very special circumstances ... persuasive subjective consideration should not be permitted to cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective facts of the offending.""
8These statements of principle in relation to conduct that is analogous to that before the Court in these proceedings are unequivocal. They are consistent with the statements or principle contained within R v Aristodemou (unreported, NSWCCA, 30/6/94):
""The will of the community that led to and is manifested by the enactment of the ICAC Act is that corruption should be eradicated from the community and that the means to produce that result should include the coercive and inquisitory powers conferred on the ICAC by statute. Where a person acts so as to frustrate an ICAC investigation into corruption it would appear to me that the community would approve that he should be severely punished. In particular I do not accept the proposition that the community would regard in any way a mitigating circumstance that the motive for the applicant's false swearing was not to conceal corruption on his own part but was to conceal the corrupt conduct of others. No doubt there is an acceptance on the part of those who commit crime that it is dishonourable to inform on others and that there is some nobility in declining to do so. It by no means follows that the same view is taken by right thinking members of the community and for my part; I decline to proceed on the assumption that this is so. It is no doubt true that in some circumstances the seriousness of a crime may be seen to be mitigated if it was committed for an honourable albeit mistaken motive. It is in my view an attempt to press that submission too far if the conduct is such to defeat the purpose of legislation enacted in the public interest.""
9Counsel for the defendant submitted the penalty should be further mitigated by reason of the offender's prior antecedents, successful efforts to engage in rehabilitation, assistance to authorities and the unfairness brought about by the delay in initiating the prosecutions. Whilst relevant in determining sentence this does not mean that the conduct in committing the offence is correspondingly mitigated. In Aristodemou the Court cited with approval the observations made in R v Bulliman (unreported, NSWCCA, 25/2/93) wherein Abadee J said:
""False evidence strikes at the whole basis of the administration of justice and indeed it undermines the whole basis of it. Justice inevitably suffers, whatever be the motive for making of false statements on oath in which the offence or offences are committed.
Subjective Factors
10Issues of principle to one side there are no aggravating features in the commission of the offence such that might be identified as falling within section 21A(2) of the Act. However, the statutory provisions do not cover the field or constrain the court. The fact that a public servant committed the offences is a relevant matter to take into account. There is unquestionably a breach of trust arising from the offender's conduct that cannot be ignored.
11The offender comes before this Court in circumstances where the Court accepts he is to be dealt with as a person of prior good character. Although there are convictions recorded on his record as a 20 year old, they are in my view to be regarded as representative minor offences committed by young people and, given the effluxion of time since they were dealt with by way of monetary penalty, for all intents and purposes, spent convictions.  
12I accept the submission by counsel that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. This inference is drawn on the basis of his self-rehabilitation during the last 4 years. I also accept the Court is entitled to draw the inference that his plea is accompanied by an appropriate level of contrition and remorse. This inference can be drawn from the fact that despite his false evidence, it was retracted under oath on the same day as it was given.  Contrition and remorse may be inferred from the early withdrawal of his false testimony and his willingness to assist authorities. In this regard the DPP concedes the offender did offer to assist but did so in relation to information of which the ICAC was already aware. Nevertheless it cannot be inferred the offender was aware of that fact and whilst, according to the DPP, his evidence was corroborative it cannot be ignored. The weight to be given however is below the customary significant additional discount for assistance to authorities. I am prepared to allocate a further 10% discount in favour of the offender on the basis of his assistance.
13The pre sentence report and submissions by counsel confirm the offender has spent the time since commission of the offences re-establishing himself within the community. In the period subsequent to his dismissal he has built up a business he first established in 2005 to the extent that he now has an established staff and a number of contractors who depend upon him for the whole or part of their livelihood. Letters of support from his wife and his father confirm a turnaround in the offender's mindset and express understandable optimism that he has rehabilitated himself to the extent that he will proceed in his life in a positive law abiding fashion. I accept that these views have a foundation of confidence that the court should not ignore.
The Sentence
14Had the Court been sentencing this offender at a time shortly after the commission of the offences there is little doubt the offender would have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Statements of principle outlined above point almost exclusively in that direction. Sentencing the offender at this time however is complicated by the period of delay between offending and prosecution. As indicated above no explanation has been provided to the court to explain why it took some 4 years to commence proceedings.  

15Delay of course has provided the offender with the opportunity to re-organise his life to the extent that he can put before this Court today a set of circumstances on rehabilitation that would not have been of such assistance at an earlier time. This is through no fault on his part. An unexplained and lengthy delay in the commencement of proceedings however does not ameliorate the appropriateness of the sentence. As Howie J said in R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at [81]:
""delay should not be allowed to dictate a sentence that is not appropriate to punish the particular offender or is not proportionate to the circumstances of the particular offence.""
 And as Street CJ said in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519: 
""sentencing for a stale crime long after committing the offences calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence when lengthy will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended.""
16Although the circumstances in both of these cases are very different from those that confront a Court exercising jurisdiction within the Local Court the principles enunciated remain pertinent. Where appropriate the consequence of inordinate delay can operate to mitigate the severity of the sentence. In my view it would be inappropriate to use delay as a mechanism for contriving a lesser penalty as some sort of ""reward"" to the offender. The court's remarks in Moon [supra] support this approach. 
17The appropriate sentence for the offence to which the plea of guilty has been entered is, after applying the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea and assistance to authorities, one of 6 months imprisonment. This is the starting point. The sentence to be imposed on the offender must also reflect the fact that 4 additional offences of like nature are to be taken into account pursuant to section 32 of the Act on a Form 1. The approach to be taken by Courts on sentence where additional matters are placed on a Form 1 is outlined in Attorney General's Application under S.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 wherein Spigelman CJ said at [42]:
""although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate ought be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they might otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. 
18Applying the guideline in these proceedings and taking into account the principle of totality I determine the appropriate sentence to be 8 months imprisonment. Having determined the appropriate sentence and in line with the directions set out in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 the Court now has to determine the manner in which such sentence is to be served. It is at this point that demonstrated rehabilitation and delay are to be applied.
19For the offender to be placed into full time custody after such a period of unexplained delay on the part of the authorities would arguably be seen as giving rise to a sense of justifiable grievance. In the hiatus between the offence and sentencing the offender has got on with his life. His children have grown with the benefit of his parenting and guidance. His marital relationship, once under threat, has been restored and appears on solid ground. His success in business has created a group of employees and contractors who are wholly or in part financially dependent on the ongoing viability of his business. 
20The question to be determined in these circumstances is whether the community's sense of entitlement to retribution identified by Spigelman CJ in my earlier remarks would be outraged by a decision not to order that the sentence of imprisonment be served in actual custody. 
21One of the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A of the Act is rehabilitation. It is not the exclusive purpose but it can never be overlooked as perhaps the final destination in any sentence, whether it be by imprisonment or not. Courts, in the proper exercise of compassion, from time to time will find it appropriate when the path to rehabilitation has been amply demonstrated, to draw back from the edge of incarceration in favour of a less onerous outcome. 
22In the context of these proceedings this is one of those occasions. In my view the purpose of denunciation, general deterrence and particular deterrence are met by identifying with clarity through an articulation of the principles and most likely consequence of this type of offending. The community however has no interest in crushing the prospect of ongoing rehabilitation and the consequences thereof where the agencies of the State have been inexplicably dilatory in acting on their behalf.
23The offender is convicted. He is sentenced to imprisonment for 8 months. In the exercise of my discretion and pursuant to section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I suspend the execution of the sentence conditionally upon the offender entering a bond to be of good behaviour for 8 months from today and appear further before this Court if called upon.

2760174,"Walker Corporation Pty Limited v Director-General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water [2012] NSWCCA 210","Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant, Walker Corporation Pty Ltd, was convicted by a judge of the Land and Environment Court of an offence contrary to s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW) ('the Act'). Section 12(2) of the Act provides that a person who offends against s 12 is liable to pay the maximum penalty provided under s 126 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), that penalty being 10,000 penalty units ($1,100,000). The primary judge ordered the appellant to pay a fine of $200,000. The appellant appeals both its conviction and sentence pursuant to s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

2The appellant filed six grounds of appeal against its conviction. A further two grounds were filed in respect of its sentence.

3Section 12 of the Native Vegetation Act prohibits the clearing of native vegetation except in accordance with a development consent or a property vegetation plan. Section 12 is in the following terms:

""12 Clearing requiring approval

(1)Native vegetation must not be cleared except in accordance with: 
(a)a development consent granted in accordance with this Act, or
(b)a property vegetation plan.

(2)A person who carries out or authorises the carrying out of clearing in contravention of this section is guilty of an offence and is liable to the maximum penalty provided for under section 126 of the EPA Act for a contravention of that Act.

(3)It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence against this section if it is established that the clearing was permitted under Division 2 or 3 or was excluded from this Act by Division 4.""

4Section 6 of the Act defines ""native vegetation"". That section is in the following terms:

""6 Meaning of native vegetation

(1)For the purposes of this Act, native vegetation means any of the following types of indigenous vegetation: 

(a)trees (including any sapling or shrub, or any scrub),
(b)understorey plants,
(c)groundcover (being any type of herbaceous vegetation),
(d)plants occurring in a wetland.

(2)Vegetation is indigenous if it is of a species of vegetation, or if it comprises species of vegetation, that existed in the State before European settlement.

(3)For the purposes of this Act, native vegetation does not include any mangroves, seagrasses or any other type of marine vegetation to which section 205 of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 applies.""

5""Clearing native vegetation"" is given meaning by s 7 of the Act, which is in the following terms:

""7 Meaning of clearing native vegetation

For the purposes of this Act, clearing native vegetation means any one or more of the following: 

(a)cutting down, felling, thinning, logging or removing native vegetation,
(b)killing, destroying, poisoning, ringbarking, uprooting or burning native vegetation.

Note. See Division 3 of Part 3 for the exclusion of routine agricultural management and other farming activities from constituting the clearing of native vegetation if the landholder can establish that any clearing was carried out for the purpose of those activities.""

6The defence provided by s 12(3) of the Act allows clearing permitted under Division 2 of Part 3 of the Act. Division 2 allows clearing of non-protected regrowth and certain ground cover and is in the following terms:

""18 Application 

(1) This Division sets out the clearing of native vegetation that is permitted to be carried out without the authority conferred by a development consent or property vegetation plan. 
(2) This Division does not permit clearing without an approval or other authority required by another Act or in contravention of another Act. 

19 Clearing of non-protected regrowth permitted 

(1) Clearing of native vegetation that is only regrowth, but not protected regrowth, is permitted. 
(2) This section is subject to any exclusion in a property vegetation plan. 

20 Clearing of certain groundcover permitted

The clearing of native vegetation that comprises only groundcover is permitted if:'

(a) the vegetation comprises less than 50% of indigenous species of vegetation, and 
(b) not less than 10% of the area is covered with vegetation (whether dead or alive), and 
(c) those percentages are calculated in accordance with the regulations."" 

7The appellant relied upon s 19 at the trial. 

8Prosecution for an offence under the Native Vegetation Act is by summary process. The summons in the present case was in the following terms:

""The Prosecutor claims:

1.An order that the Defendant Walker Corporation Pty Ltd (A.C.N. 0076 263) of Level 50, Governor Phillip Tower 1 Farrar Place, Sydney in the State of New South Wales, appear before a Judge of the Court to answer the charge that, between about 1 June 2006 and 6 February 2007 inclusive, at or near Wilton in the State of New South Wales, it committed an offence against section 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003, in that it carried out clearing of native vegetation otherwise than in accordance with a development consent granted in accordance with that Act or a property vegetation plan.

9At the trial the respondent alleged that clearing had taken place over an area of approximately 23 hectares. It was alleged to have taken the form of mulching trees and shrubs in situ or pushing them over and mulching them. The respondent accepted that a number of trees were preserved within the areas which had been cleared.

10Although 30 species were specified in the summons only seven species were identified in the evidence as having been cleared:

(a)Allocasuarina LittoralisBlack She-Oak
(b)Eucalyptus CerebraNarrow-leaved Ironbark
(c)Exocarpus CupressiformisCherry Ballart, Native Cherry

(f)Pimelea Linifolia subspRiceflower

11The respondent did not allege that the appellant itself physically cleared any land; rather, it alleged that Environmental Land Clearing Pty Ltd (""ELC"") carried out the work at the request of the appellant. The respondent's case was that the appellant was liable pursuant to s 44 of the Act of having caused or permitted the clearing, or otherwise being liable at law for the activities of its contractor. Section 44 raises a presumption that the landholder of any land will be taken to have cleared it unless it is established that it did not cause or permit that clearing. The section is in the following terms:

""44Evidentiary provision

In any criminal or civil proceedings, the landholder of any land on which native vegetation is cleared is taken to have carried out the clearing unless it is established that: 

(a)the clearing was carried out by another person, and

(b)the landholder did not cause or permit the other person to carry out the clearing.

This section does not prevent proceedings being taken against the person who actually carried out the clearing.""

12At the trial, employees of ELC acknowledged that ELC had cleared blackberries, mulched ""smaller standing"" trees and scrubby bush and cleared a riparian zone. However, the respondent did not accept that this evidence reflected the true nature of the clearing activities. The respondent called Mr John Palmer, a Natural Resource Information Officer employed by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water. Mr Palmer used aerial photographs and images taken from a satellite known as ""SPOT 5"", which uses remote sensing technology to collect panchromatic, multi-spectral and infra-ray imagery. Mr Palmer concluded from his analysis of the available images that woody vegetation was present on the land which had been cleared prior to 1 January 1990 and that such vegetation was present within those areas of the property cleared by the appellant between 1 June 2006 and 6 February 2007.

13The respondent also called evidence from Mr Kenneth Turner, a terrestrial ecologist. Mr Turner carried out two site inspections of the cleared land and examined nearby areas which had not been cleared. He also used aerial photography and the imagery from the SPOT 5 satellite. He concluded that the seven identified specifies had been cleared from the property. However, he was not able to specify the number of each species which was removed and accordingly was unable to identify the total quantity of the vegetation which had been removed.

14At the trial the appellant raised a number of issues described in the submissions to this Court as ""threshold questions."" They included whether the vegetation removed included ""native vegetation"" within the meaning of the Act, whether the clearing was permitted because it was regrowth within the meaning of s 19(1) of the Act, and whether the appellant could be criminally liable for any act of ELC.

15The appellant called evidence from Dr Andrew Smith and Dr AnnMarie Clements. Its defence to the prosecution case included the following submissions:

A.there was no direct evidence that the seven species alleged to have been cleared were present on the property prior to the clearing;

B.there was no direct evidence that those seven species had in fact been cleared;

C.it was not possible to infer from the fact that those seven species were subsequently identified in certain random and different cleared and uncleared areas on the property that such species had been cleared from the identified areas on the property totalling 23 ha between June 2006 and February 2007;

D.the appellant did not ""cause"" or ""permit"" ELC to carry out the offence, and accordingly the prosecutor was not able to gain assistance from s 44 of the Act so as to attribute criminal responsibility to the appellant, nor was the appellant vicariously liable for ELC's acts; and

E.ELC's clearing activities were limited to removing noxious weeds (such as blackberries), ""underscrubbing"" (which may have involved the removal of regrowth), removing dead wood to clean up the property, and associated regrowth.

Ground 1:The trial was conducted on the basis of a charge that was inadequately particularised, in that it failed to specify the native vegetation that was allegedly cleared.

16The law requires that a defendant in criminal proceedings be told of the legal nature of the alleged offence and of the particular act, matter or thing alleged to be the foundation of the charge: Kirk v Industrial Court (NSW) [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [26] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell JJ). In Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77; (1937) 59 CLR 467, Dixon J said at 489:

""[In the present case] the question is whether the prosecutor should not be required to identify one of a number of sets of facts, each amounting to the commission of the same offence as that on which the charge is based. In my opinion he clearly should be required to identify the transaction on which he relies and he should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint, in spite of its apparent particularity, is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the complaint. For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. The court hearing a complaint or information for an offence must have before it a means of identifying with the matter or transaction alleged in the document the matter or transaction appearing in evidence.""

17The charge must specify ""the time, place and manner of the defendant's acts or omissions"": Kirk at [26]; Johnson at 486. The purpose in providing particulars is to inform the court of the nature of the offence and to provide the accused with an understanding of the charge so that he or she can properly defend against it: John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42; (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 519; Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR(NSW) 153. Accordingly, particulars will be inadequate if they do not enable a defendant to effectively rely upon any statutory defences which may be available to it: Kirk at [27]-[38]; Johnson at 483-484, 490.

18The appellant submitted that the summons which commenced the proceedings failed to meet the obligation to provide adequate particulars. It was submitted that it failed to specify the actual vegetation alleged to have been cleared, the quantum of the vegetation making up the seven species which were identified, or the location of the species or individual plants beyond a ""vague assertion"" that 23 ha of land were cleared.

19It was submitted that these failures amounted to more than a procedural irregularity and that they undermined the appellant's ability to put forward the defences available under the Act. In particular, it was submitted that in the absence of any particulars or specific evidence of particular specimens said to have been unlawfully cleared, it was not possible for the appellant to lead evidence that such specimens were ""regrowth"" within the meaning of the Act. Nor, so it was submitted, was it possible for the appellant to meet the case by showing the particular plant matter alleged to have been cleared was dead.

20The respondent submitted that the appellant's argument failed to appreciate the inter-relationship between the definition of native vegetation in the Act and the allegation in the summons. It was submitted, as alleged in paragraph 1(b) of the summons, that the entirety of the vegetation cleared from the 23 ha was ""native vegetation"" by reason of the fact that it included one or more of the seven species.

21The respondent emphasised the manner in which native vegetation was defined in s 6(1) of the Act. It was submitted that to construe s 6(1) of the Act as referring only to individual specimens such as the seven identified species is to disregard the use of the plural in ss 6(1)(a)-(d) and, more significantly, the phrase ""or if it comprises species of vegetation. The Macquarie Dictionary defines the word ""comprise"" relevantly as including to comprehend, include, contain, consist of, be composed of, or to combine to make up.

22It was submitted that in the context of the Act, the word ""comprises"" must be construed as ""includes"" or ""contains."" It was submitted that to construe the word as meaning ""consists of"" or ""is composed of"" so as to limit the definition of ""native vegetation"" to species existing in the State before European settlement would simply be to repeat what is already conveyed by the words ""if it is of a species of vegetation"", making the words ""or if it comprises species of vegetation"" superfluous. It was submitted that this construction is consistent with and best gives effect to the stated objects of the Act, in particular that referred to in s 3(b), which is in the following terms:

""3Objects of Act

The objects of this Act are: 

(a)to provide for, encourage and promote the management of native vegetation on a regional basis in the social, economic and environmental interests of the State, and

(b)to prevent broadscale clearing unless it improves or maintains environmental outcomes, and

(c)to protect native vegetation of high conservation value having regard to its contribution to such matters as water quality, biodiversity, or the prevention of salinity or land degradation, and

(d)to improve the condition of existing native vegetation, particularly where it has high conservation value, and

(e)to encourage the revegetation of land, and the rehabilitation of land, with appropriate native vegetation,

in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.""

23It was submitted that further support for this construction of the Act is found in s 20, which provides that the clearing of ""native vegetation"" that comprises only ground cover is permitted if the vegetation comprises less than 50 per cent of indigenous species of vegetation. The section contemplates that ""native vegetation"" may include indigenous and non-indigenous species.

24The appellant responded to these submissions by considering previous decisions in relation to the meaning of the word ""comprise."" There is an exhaustive analysis by Lindgren J of the word in General Clutch Corporation v Spriggs Pty Ltd (1997) 38 IPR 359 at 373-376. As Lindgren J's analysis makes plain, the correct interpretation of the word ""comprise"" depends upon the context in which it is used. 

25The appellant submitted that the word ""comprises"" in s 6 of the Act should be understood to mean ""consists of"" or ""composed of"", rather than ""includes."" It was submitted that the relevant word should be given the meaning consistent with ordinary usage and ""common sense."" Section 6(2) prescribes a specific, particular characteristic for vegetation to qualify as indigenous, that being vegetation which ""existed in the State before European settlement."" It was submitted that that specific characteristic must be applied to each species under consideration.

26It was further submitted that the interpretation advanced by the appellant does give effect to each of the words in the statute. It was submitted that the words ""if it is of a species ... or if it comprises species ..."" in s 6(2) is intended to accommodate the situation where the type of vegetation under consideration in s 6(1) is not uniform but is made up of more than one kind of indigenous plant. In the alternative, it was submitted that s 6(1) states that vegetation ""means"" various types of ""indigenous vegetation."" Some of these are plural (eg trees and plants) and some are singular (eg sapling or shrub, or any scrub). Accordingly, it was submitted that the words ""if it is of a species"" does have work to do even if comprises does not mean includes.

27The appellant emphasised that when construing a provision imposing criminal liability, the rule of lenity requires that any ambiguity be resolved in favour of the defendant: Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55; (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576 (Gibbs J); Waugh v Kippen [1986] HCA 12; (1986) 160 CLR 156 at 164 (Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ); Capral Aluminium Ltd v WorkCover Authority (NSW) [2000] NSWIRComm 71; (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at 629; see also Holmes v Director General of the Department of Infrastructure Planning and Natural Resources [2005] NSWLEC 264; (2005) 139 LGERA 102 at [26] and cases cited there by Lloyd J.

28It was further submitted that the Act restricts the use a person can make of property and, accordingly, the general presumption in the event of ambiguity is that the court should prefer an interpretation that does not interfere with a citizen's proprietary rights: Clissold v Perry [1904] HCA 12; (1904) 1 CLR 363 at 373; Commonwealth v Hazeldell Ltd [1918] HCA 75; (1918) 25 CLR 552 at 563; Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners [1927] AC 343; CJ Burland Pty Ltd v Metropolitan Meat Industry Board [1968] HCA 77; (1968) 120 CLR 400 at 406-407, 15; see also the cases cited in D C Pearce and R S Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (2011, 7th ed) at [5.21].

29The appellant submitted that the relevant object of the Act in s 3 is to prevent the clearing of native vegetation. Native vegetation means indigenous vegetation and, accordingly, if the definition of ""native vegetation"" is read as including indigenous and non-indigenous vegetation, the Act would extend beyond its stated objects by criminalising the clearing of non-native vegetation.

30The appellant submitted that s 20 does not assist the respondent. It was submitted that it provides a special exemption in relation to clearing of certain ground cover. It was further submitted that if it be relevant at all, the provision assists the appellant. The appellant submitted that if ""indigenous vegetation"" means, as the prosecutor suggests, vegetation that ""includes"" species of vegetation that existed in the State before European settlement, it would be a nonsense to speak of vegetation comprising ""less than 50% of indigenous species of vegetation"" because, if the definition of ""indigenous"" in s 6(2) were applied, then ""indigenous species"" in s 20 would itself include indigenous and non-indigenous species. It was submitted that it would be absurd to construe the Act so that the clearing of non-indigenous species on land was a criminal offence.

31The issue of the meaning of the word ""comprises"" was raised for the first time in this appeal in the context of this ground of appeal. There was no suggestion at the trial that the appellant did not understand the nature of the charge and the particulars relevant to it sufficiently to be able to mount its defence.

32It must be remembered that in many situations where native vegetation exists there is also likely to be vegetation which is not indigenous. Ordinary experience suggests that many introduced species have found Australia's natural environment conducive to their propagation, very often to a level that seriously impacts upon the indigenous species. It could not have been the intention of the legislature that in circumstances where non-indigenous species were present, the Act would not operate to protect the indigenous species of vegetation.

33Accordingly, I accept the respondent's submission that a purposive interpretation of s 6(2) requires that the word ""comprises"" be construed as ""includes"". To construe the word as meaning ""consists of"" would frustrate the Act's stated objects of protecting native vegetation and preventing broadscale clearing that does not improve or maintain environmental outcomes. So to construe s 6(2) would require the prosecution to painstakingly identify the precise quantum of indigenous vegetation within a large parcel of land. In most cases where native vegetation has been cleared, although it may be possible to identify after the event that some individual trees have been removed, the vegetation will be in such a state that it is not possible to identify individual plants or trees which have been destroyed. The practical result of the appellant's interpretation would be to preclude a good many prosecutions, even where the evidence suggests that large-scale clearing has incidentally destroyed native vegetation.

34The appellant's submission that ambiguous penal statutes must be interpreted in favour of a defendant is a truism. But the argument, as applied to the Act under consideration, wrongly assumes that s 6(2) is ambiguous. Gibbs J's comments in Beckwith v The Queen at 576 are instructive:

""The rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times. In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences ... The rule is perhaps one of last resort.""

35The applicant has failed to clear the first hurdle of establishing an ambiguity in s 6(2) of the Act. The ""ordinary rules of construction"" to which Gibbs J referred include the principle that statutes are to be construed in context and in such a way as to best give effect to their object and purpose. As the High Court made clear in CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408, context and purpose are to be ""considered in the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise"". An interpretation of s 6(2) that has regard to context and purpose leaves no room for ambiguity. There is therefore no warrant for resorting to the rule that a penal statute ought to be strictly construed.

36In any event, at the trial, the appellant had no difficulty in understanding that it was charged with removing multiple plants of varying species which were indigenous. It understood that it was alleged that the species were dispersed throughout 23 ha of land which had been cleared by mechanical means, although some individual trees remained. If the appellant contended, as it did, that the vegetation which was removed was only regrowth as provided by s 19, it could have brought evidence to establish that fact. However, the prosecution case was that even if there was some non-native vegetation present, there was throughout the 23 ha parcel of land native vegetation which was removed, and that the presence of that vegetation was established by a careful examination of portions of the land which had been cleared to establish from the residue of destroyed vegetation whether it was native. Those observations were supported by a detailed examination of portions of adjoining land which had not been cleared.

37The interpretation of s 6(2) on which I have settled does not preclude a defendant from seeking to establish that the trees and plants which were on the land were regrowth within the meaning of the Act. In the same manner that the prosecution may carry out a detailed survey to determine the trees and plants that were present, a defendant may itself survey the land to establish the age of those trees and plants.

38Although I am not persuaded that the appellant did not have sufficient particulars to defend against the charge, the dispersion and likely density of the trees and plants on the land were relevant to the quantum of the penalty. I shall consider in relation to the ground of appeal which challenges the appropriateness of the penalty the evidence that established the amount of vegetation existing on the land that was cleared. 

Ground 2:The primary judge erred in holding that the prosecutor discharged its onus of proving that native vegetation was cleared on the land.

39I have previously referred to the fact that the respondent called evidence from Mr Turner and Mr Palmer. Mr Turner based his analysis on photographs, a satellite image and field data collected by his assistants. He also carried out field inspections of relevant areas of the site.

40The photographic images did not enable the identification of individual species. However, this was obtained by detailed field inspection. Mr Turner chose at random 4 plots 20 metres by 20 metres within the cleared areas and 3 plots of a similar size in the areas of adjacent uncleared vegetation. He identified native vegetation in the uncleared areas and from samples of native vegetation in the cleared lots concluded that seven native species had been cleared. 

41Mr Turner did not recall any individual plant in any particular position or mark its presence on the ground. The appellant submitted that, accordingly, it was denied the opportunity of calling evidence as to whether these plants were regrowth or had been cleared for some other reason, perhaps because they were already dead. Mr Turner's evidence was also criticised because he could not give evidence of any ""scientific process"" that he used to identify any of these stumps or other ""trittered or shredded"" plants, or their age.

42There was no direct evidence of any of the seven species having been observed and identified within the cleared areas of the property at a time before the clearing and shredding of vegetation. Accordingly, the respondent relied upon the evidence brought forward by Mr Turner and Dr Smith from which it submitted that it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that the seven species had existed on the property and had been cleared.

43An appeal to this Court under s 5AA is confined to an appeal ""in the strict sense"": Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399; (2002) 55 NSWLR 593 at 598. The appellant must demonstrate error. 

44Mr Turner's evidence was that each of the 7 species was observed by him to be present in uncleared areas located adjacent to the cleared areas on the property. He concluded from the satellite imagery and aerial photography that the cleared areas had vegetation patterns that were continuous with and essentially identical to those in the adjacent uncleared area. He said that the cleared and uncleared areas examined by him had the same geology, soil, topography and disturbance history and were part of a single stratification unit.

45Mr Turner said that his examination of the cleared areas within 2 to 6 weeks after clearing ceased revealed the presence of Alocasuarina littoralis, Eucalyptus cerebra, and Hardenbergia violacea. This evidence was accepted by the primary judge and of itself was capable of sustaining a finding beyond reasonable doubt that at least these three species had been present and cleared from the land. Consideration of the evidence obtained from the detailed examination of the areas within and outside the cleared area established the presence of the remaining four species within the cleared area. This evidence was accepted by her Honour and in my judgment she was entitled to so accept it.

46Mr Turner's evidence was criticised on the appeal on the basis that he did not explain how his field of ""specialised knowledge"" had been applied to the facts assumed or observed to produce the opinion he propounded: Makita Australia v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85]. This objection was not taken at the trial. In any event a criticism in these terms was rejected by the primary judge at [209] of her Honour's judgment. 

47Although Mr Turner expressed a conclusion, the evidence he gave of his observations when he examined the site and the evidence given by others who carried out fieldwork on his behalf proved the presence of the relevant species. That conclusion could have been arrived at by the primary judge without relying upon Mr Turner's conclusion.

48At the trial the appellant called evidence from Dr Smith and Dr Clements.

49It was submitted to this Court that from their evidence inferences were available to the primary judge which were contrary to those which the respondent submitted should be drawn. It was submitted that even if there was native vegetation in uncleared areas it was possible that none existed in the cleared areas prior to the clearing activities. It was also submitted that because some native species had been left in the cleared areas it was open to her Honour to conclude that no native species had actually been removed. It was further submitted that the primary judge approached the task of determining whether the respondent had discharged its onus by merely choosing between the opinions of Mr Turner and Dr Smith.

50The appellant made a number of submissions that were critical of her Honour's findings. Her Honour said at [212]:

""Dr Smith conceded that Allocasurina Littoralis was widespread throughout the property. It is therefore reasonable to find, and I do so without any doubt, that it was cleared from the property as charged."" 

51The appellant submitted that it was not permissible to conclude, from a ""concession"" by Dr Smith or from the presence of that species throughout the property, that particular specimens were cleared in particular identified areas.

52Her Honour further said:

""In relation to Hardenbeergia Violacea, Dr Smith's observations that the species was sufficiently small that it may not have been individually affected by mulching equipment does not accord with Mr Turner's observations of the species in the recently cleared areas. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was cleared from the property as charged."" 

53It was submitted that this conclusion was illogical and incorrect: that Mr Turner recorded the presence of this species in three cleared plots and one uncleared plot is wholly consistent with Dr Smith's observation that the species was sufficiently small that it may not have been individually affected by mulching equipment. It was submitted that her Honour was not entitled to draw the conclusion that she did, to the criminal standard of proof.

54Her Honour also said at [213]: 

""In relation to Eucalyptus Crebra, Dr Smith contended that the species was sufficiently rare or uncommon that it was in all likelihood naturally absent from the cleared areas ... I agree with the submission of the prosecutor that [the cross-examination of Dr Smith as to errors in the recorded instances of this species] gives rise to a genuine concern as to the accuracy of the fieldwork founding Dr Smith's opinions as to the likely presence of the seven species from the cleared area. For this reason, I prefer the evidence of Mr Turner who found actual evidence of Eucalyptus Crebra in all seven plots he surveyed, both in the northern and southern cleared areas on the property. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this species was cleared on the property."" (emphasis added) 

55It was submitted that it was impermissible to reason, from the rejection of Dr Smith's opinion, that Mr Turner's opinion as to the presence of Eucalyptus Crebra, allegedly in all seven cleared and uncleared plots, proved that it had been cleared. This was said to be particularly so where, as set out above, Eucalyptus Crebra was a large canopy tree, and the prosecutor's own witnesses did not give any evidence of clearing canopy trees and consistently described their activities as ""underscrubbing.""

56It was submitted that similar criticisms applied in relation to the findings at [215], [217], [218] and [220] of her Honour's reasons relating to each of the remaining specimens. It was submitted that in each case, the primary judge reasoned that, because the Court preferred the evidence of Mr Turner, the prosecutor's case was proved beyond reasonable doubt. It was submitted that scant attention was paid to the quality of the prosecutor's own evidence, and for the reasons set out above, even if the Court accepted that evidence, it did not rise to the standard required to convict the appellant of the offence charged.

57I do not accept the appellant's submissions. I do accept that a superficial reading of her Honour's reasons may lead the reader to the view that having preferred the evidence of Mr Turner to that of Dr Smith her Honour did not otherwise consider whether Mr Turner's evidence justified a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the relevant species were present. However, a more faithful reading of her Honour's reasons brings me to the conclusion that she carefully considered the evidence of the appellant's witnesses on the relevant issue and, finding it flawed in relevant respects, addressed the particular issue having regard to Mr Turner's evidence. Having formed the conclusion that Mr Turner's evidence was, if accepted, capable of proving the disputed fact, and finding that there were reasons not to accept the appellant's witnesses, her Honour made findings that she was satisfied of the disputed fact beyond reasonable doubt. Her Honour did not say, as perhaps she could have, that she rejected the evidence of the appellant's witnesses. However, she did say that the problems with their evidence left only the respondent's evidence, which could in the absence of any demonstrated problems be accepted. Her Honour accepted it and in so doing expressed her satisfaction that the relevant fact was proved beyond reasonable doubt. This conclusion was plainly open and her Honour did not err in reasoning to it.

Ground 3:This ground was abandoned.

Ground 4:The primary judge erred in finding that vegetation includes, for the purposes of s 6 of the Act, both living and dead plant matter and in finding that the extended clearing of dead plant matter remains unquantified.

58Her Honour did conclude that vegetation includes, for the purposes of s 6 of the Act, both living and dead plant matter. Her Honour also said that the issue ""was of marginal significance"". 

59The appellant submitted to this Court that both the ordinary meaning of vegetation and the structure of the Act make plain that it was not intended to apply to dead plants.

60The Macquarie Dictionary defines vegetation as ""plants collectively, plant life of a particular region considered as a whole."" It was submitted that the reference to life excludes from the ordinary meaning of the word plant material which is dead. With respect to the Act both s 20 and s 46 use the word ""dead"", contrasting it with living vegetation. Section 20 speaks of ground cover ""whether dead or alive"" and s 46 permits regulations to be made to prohibit the clearing of ""dead wood"" from any land.

61Before this Court the respondent indicated that it was not responsible for this issue being raised in the Land and Environment Court. It appears that the primary judge herself determined that the issue was relevant and resolved it in the manner in which I have indicated. The opposition by the respondent to the appellant's submission in this Court was, to say the least, faint.

62To my mind her Honour's conclusion that vegetation includes dead plant matter was not correct. Obviously a plant will be a plant, whether it is dead or alive. However, the concern of s 6 is with vegetation which is defined ""for the purposes of the Act"" to mean any of the stated types of indigenous vegetation. Section 7 makes plain that so far as the Act requires approval for the clearing of native vegetation, it contemplates the clearing of living vegetation only. It would be an extraordinary use of language to speak of cutting down, felling, burning, logging or removing dead plants or trees or killing, destroying, poisoning or uprooting dead plants: see ss 7(a)-(b). Construed in the context of the Act, these activities are only relevant to living plants or trees. One may speak of burning dead vegetation, but given the other verbs in s 7, the draftsperson must have been referring to burning living plants or trees.

63Such an interpretation is entirely consistent with the objects of the Act, set out at [22] of this judgment. The legislative purpose is clearly to protect native vegetation and avoid its unplanned removal or degradation. When, by whatever means, a plant or tree has died it would require clear words before removal of a plant or tree in that state without the necessary authority constituted a criminal offence.

64The finding by her Honour that the issue was of marginal significance was challenged in this Court. It was emphasised that there was evidence that at least part of the clearing that was carried out was of dead plant matter. That evidence came from Mr Humphreys, who said that he observed a lot of trees on the ground that were dead. Similar evidence was given by Mr Mills, Ms Ridge and Mr Hinton. The report of Dr Smith also indicated that there were ""high numbers of dead trees"" on the property which were cleared.

65The trial judge disposed of this issue by finding that it was of marginal significance because the ""extent"" of the clearing was ""unquantified"". It was submitted that this finding was wrong and constituted a reversal of the onus of proof. It was submitted that her Honour did not appreciate that the prosecutor had failed to quantify the extent of the clearing of native vegetation. If there was a failure to prove the extent of dead wood which was cleared, it was submitted, the corollary must be that the extent of live vegetation was also not quantified and the offence had therefore not been proved.

66I do not accept this submission. The evidence which her Honour accepted was capable, as her Honour found, of proving that extant native vegetation had been cleared irrespective of whether her Honour had erroneously accepted that dead vegetation had been illegally cleared. However, if her Honour gave weight to the clearing of dead vegetation when determining the extent of environmental harm occasioned by the appellant's activities, this may require a reconsideration of the matter of penalty.

Ground 5:The primary judge erred in holding that the appellant caused ELC to carry out the clearing within the meaning of s 44 of the Act.

Ground 6:The primary judge erred in finding that the clearing carried out by ELC was done in accordance with and directly as a result of the appellant's instructions.

67These two grounds of appeal may be dealt with together.

68Section 44 of the Act provides:

""44Evidentiary provision

In any criminal or civil proceedings, the landholder of any land on which native vegetation is cleared is taken to have carried out the clearing unless it is established that: 

(a)the clearing was carried out by another person, and
(b)the landholder did not cause or permit the other person to carry out the clearing.

This section does not prevent proceedings being taken against the person who actually carried out the clearing.""

69It was conceded before the primary judge that the appellant was a ""landholder"" within the meaning of the Act, because it both had ""lawful management or control"" of the land and was the owner of it. Accordingly, the burden fell on the appellant to prove on the balance of probabilities that it did not ""cause or permit"" ELC to carry out the clearing. The primary judge found that the appellant ""caused"" but did not ""permit"" ELC to carry out the clearing.

70The evidence before the primary judge indicated that Mr Humphreys, on behalf of ELC, was instructed by Mr Fife, on behalf of the appellant, to ""tidy up the site"". Mr Fife also instructed Mr Humphreys to clear certain areas ""back by 50 metres"" to provide a buffer around those sections.

71The primary judge found that although Mr Fife gave instructions as to the areas of land to be cleared and their location he ""did not instruct [Mr Humphreys] with any particular specificity as to what vegetation the clearing was to include"". Mr Fife instructed Mr Humphreys to ""keep the undergrowth at bay"", by which he meant ""small regrowth"" or ""small trees that looked like they have grown relatively recently"".

72Mr Fife attended the site ""a couple of times"" during the clearing activity. The primary judge found that on one occasion he observed mulching and on both occasions expressed satisfaction with the progress of the works.

73The submission to the primary judge and to this Court by the appellant was that it had contacted ELC to do the work and relied on its expertise and knowledge as land clearing specialists. However, the primary judge found that the evidence did not establish that ELC held itself out as being able to provide specialist expertise and advice on whether the clearing of vegetation that it was engaged to carry out was lawful or not. Furthermore, her Honour was not satisfied that the appellant engaged ELC for that purpose or relied upon ELC's alleged expertise. Her Honour further found that ELC did not have the relevant expertise.

74The primary judge found that the clearing carried out by ELC was carried out ""in accordance with and directly as a result of Walker's instructions."" Her Honour found that as a result ELC mulched, trimmed and felled native vegetation in areas indicated by Mr Fife and the clearing of native vegetation was ""a natural consequence of the instructions given by Mr Fife"".

75Her Honour said at [306]-[307]:

""While I accept the submission of the defendant that there is no suggestion in any of the evidence that there was any instruction by the defendant to clear native vegetation, this is irrelevant to the determination of whether the landholder caused the unlawful clearing given the offence is one of strict liability.

I therefore find that the defendant has not established on the balance of probabilities that the clearing undertaken by ELC was not caused by the defendant and that therefore, as the landholder, the defendant is to be taken to have carried out the clearing pursuant to s 44 of the Act.""

76Her Honour did accept the submission of the appellant that it did not permit the clearing undertaken by ELC for the purposes of s 44. Her Honour's reasons for this finding were expressed at [308]-[309] in the following terms:

""There is no evidence that prior to the receipt of the copy of the 2006 Keystone report Mr Fife had any awareness or knowledge that native vegetation would be cleared in breach of the Act. At is highest the evidence reveals that he was careless as to consequences of his instructions to ELC. This is insufficient, however, to amount to permission for the purposes of s 44 of the Act.

While the receipt of the attachment to the 27 September 2006 email arguably conferred on Mr Fife a greater appreciation of the possible unlawful consequences of the clearing that he had directed ELC to carry out, absent any evidence that he read the attachment or understood the significance of its contents, I am not satisfied that its receipt, without more, had the consequence that he 'permitted' the clearing of native vegetation by ELC after he gave the approval for the clearing to resume in or about October 2007, for the purposes of the Act.""

77Her Honour then considered whether the appellant was vicariously liable for ELC's acts. Although her Honour was not satisfied that the appellant exercised control or direction over ELC in the execution of the work, her Honour found that the appellant authorised ELC to remove the vegetation. Her Honour approached the issue in the same manner as Lloyd J in Coffs Harbour City Council v Hickey [2004] NSWLEC 531, where a specific instruction to do an act which would ""lead by all physical necessity to the felling of the trees"" was held to be sufficient to found liability in the giver of the instruction.

78Her Honour said at [317]-[318]:

""In the present case, I find that the instructions given by Mr Fife to ELC were sufficient to amount to a direction to do an act that would lead by all physical necessity to the clearing of native vegetation. Mr Fife directed ELC to remove the ""undergrowth"" or ""small regrowth"". While what this constituted was left up to ELC, given the absence of instruction by Mr Fife as to what could be removed, the execution of Mr Fife's instructions led by all physical necessity to the clearing of native vegetation. The clearing of ""undergrowth"" and/or ""small regrowth"" constituted the work that ELC was directed by the defendant to perform, which included the removal of native vegetation. The instructions, framed as they were, led to much more than a mere risk that the consequential event of unlawful clearing of native vegetation would occur; they led inexorably and inevitably to this end (McConnell Dowell at [119]). I make this finding in light of the earlier findings made by me concerning the reliance placed by the defendant on ELC's specialist knowledge and expertise. For this reason I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is vicariously liable for the clearing carried out by ELC.

However, I do not find that the evidence demonstrates to the requisite degree or standard that the defendant exercised detailed control over the manner of doing the work which led to the clearing of the native vegetation. That is to say, the evidence does not disclose that the defendant, through Mr Fife, supervised the works or instructed ELC as to how the clearing should take place sufficient to establish that the defendant ought to be vicariously liable for the clearing carried out by ELC on this basis (Multiplex at [276]-[292]).""

79The appellant submitted that in making these findings her Honour erred in a number of respects. The errors were articulated in the following terms:

in finding that the appellant ""caused"" the clearing to occur under s 44 of the Act, her Honour applied the wrong test and also reached erroneous factual findings;

holding that the clearing by ELC was done in accordance with and directly as a result of the appellant's instructions; and

her Honour should have found that the clearing was undertaken as a direct result of ELC's own decision to clear.

80The appellant accepted that appropriate guidance in the resolution of these issues could be found in Environmental Protection Authority v Multiplex Constructions Pty Limited [2000] NSWLEC 6; (2000) 112 LGERA 1 at [238]-[260]. The respondent did not contend otherwise. The relevant principles were accepted to be that:

(a)""causing"" should be given its common sense meaning: Alphacell Limited v Woodward [1972] AC 824 at 834, 847;

(b)a person causes a result where he or she deliberately and intentionally does an act which naturally produces a certain outcome: Alphacell at 839;

(c)the defendant must engage in a positive act to ""cause"" something to occur and this act need not be an immediate cause: Environment Agency (formerly National Rivers Authority) v Empress Car Co (Albertilly) Limited [1999] 2 AC 22 at 27-28;

(d)the active involvement of a third party may, but does not necessarily, break the causal connection: Empress Car Co at 33, 36-37; and

(e)in determining whether the involvement of a third party excludes the defendant as a causative factor, the court should consider whether the actions of the third party were an ordinary occurrence or something extraordinary. This is a question of fact: Empress Car Co at 36.

81The appellant submitted that her Honour's finding that the appellant had not ""permitted"" ELC to carry out the clearing should have led her Honour to reach a negative conclusion on the question whether the appellant caused the clearing. The relevant reasoning is set out at [308]-[309] of her Honour's judgment, quoted in full at [76] of this judgment.

82The difficulty in the appellant's submission is that when considering the issue of ""permission"" her Honour focused upon whether Mr Fife, at the relevant time, had any awareness that native vegetation would be cleared in breach of the Act. In adopting this approach, accepted by the appellant to be correct, her Honour followed Department of Environment and Climate Change v Olmwood Pty Limited [2010] NSWLEC 15; (2010) 173 LGERA 366 at [358]-[359].

83However, with respect to the issue of whether the appellant caused the clearing, her Honour said at [274]:

""Distilling [Director-General, Department of Environment and Climate Change v Jack & Bill Issa Pty Ltd (No 5) [2009] NSWLEC 232] and Olmwood, the following principles emerge in the context of a prosecution under s 12 of the Act where liability is being attributed to a corporate defendant pursuant to s 44 of the Act:

(a)first, s 44(b) provides a statutory basis of landholder liability arising out of the acts of a third party separate from the common law principles of vicarious liability (Olmwood at [354]). However, an offence against s 12 is one of strict liability thereby attracting the principles of vicarious liability (Issa at [80]);

(b)second, the defence provided for in s 44 must be established on the balance of probabilities by the defendant (Olmwood at [333];

(c)third, a company can be criminally liable through the actions of its officers or employees, as the embodiment of the company (Issa at [79]);

(d)fourth, in determining who is the 'directing mind and will' of the company the real question is, on the proper construction of the statute, whose act is intended to count as the act of the company (Issa at [82]). The acts of both a high-level employee or director and the acts of low-level employees may count if that is required by the terms or the offence and the objects of the statute (Issa at [83]);

(e)fifth, in cases concerning a protective regulatory regime such as that contained in s 12 of the Act, the conduct of officers or employees involved in the actus reus of the offence may be attributed to the company at least where such conduct is in furtherance of the company's interests or not against them (Issa at [97]);

(f)sixth, to ""cause"" clearing does not require the exercise of particular control over the third party whose actions resulted in the clearing event to the extent that would otherwise be necessary to establish vicarious liability. Where the clearing by a third party arises as a natural consequence of the landholder's conduct that landholder can be said to have caused the clearing (Olmwood at [355]); and

(g) seventh, to ""permit"" means to intentionally allow. That is to say, with knowledge or awareness rather than any intentional failure to act. Further, knowledge that something that is a contravention is likely to be done in the future is to ""permit"" it to be done. However, mere carelessness or negligence in failing to prevent an act giving rise to a contravention is not to ""permit"" it to occur (Olmwood at [358]-[359]).""

84The appellant submitted that, as with ""permit"", before a person or corporation can ""cause"" the relevant act there must be ""an element of intention to do the act which brought about the breach of the Act"". The appellant accepted that Lloyd J's approach to the issue is correct.

85The controversy arises because of the terms of s 44, which I repeat here for convenience:

""44Evidentiary provision

In any criminal or civil proceedings, the landholder of any land on which native vegetation is cleared is taken to have carried out the clearing unless it is established that: 

(a)the clearing was carried out by another person, and

(b)the landholder did not cause or permit the other person to carry out the clearing.

This section does not prevent proceedings being taken against the person who actually carried out the clearing.""

86Accordingly, to avoid liability for the clearing of the land, the appellant carried the burden of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that it did not cause ELC to carry out the clearing. It was submitted that her Honour should have found that the appellant did not have the requisite intention and accordingly did not ""cause"" ELC to carry out the clearing.

87The difficulty with the appellant's submission is that it attributes the same factual elements to cause as it does to the word ""permit"" in s 44. Her Honour held that permit means ""intentionally to allow"", the relevant ""knowledge"" being ""that native vegetation would be cleared in breach of the Act"". Lloyd J's analysis does not import ""knowledge"" of that character in relation to the different standard of ""causing."" Her Honour recognised that knowledge in the context of causing something to be done is different to knowledge in the context of permitting something to be done. Her Honour found that the appellant, through Mr Fife, instructed ELC to clear the land in a manner which would ""lead by all physical necessity to the clearing of native vegetation."" In so finding, her Honour applied the principles identified by Lloyd J and accepted by the appellant. I see no error in her Honour's approach.

88It was submitted that the appellant's instructions to ELC were confined and that Mr Fife did not direct ELC as to what vegetation should be cleared and, furthermore, the appellant was entitled to rely on ELC's expertise in environmental matters. This submission confronts insurmountable difficulties. Her Honour found that the instructions which were given included instructions to remove vegetation which was native vegetation. Secondly, her Honour expressly rejected the proposition that the appellant relied on ELC's specialist expertise and experience. The appellant has not demonstrated that her Honour was not entitled to make these findings or that they are incorrect.

89The appellant, relying on Multiplex, submitted that the appellant was not relevantly in control of the work carried out by ELC (see Multiplex at [265]-[269], [273]). However, as Lloyd J otherwise explained, and the appellant accepted, the question is not answered by a finding as to whether the landowner controlled the action of the contractor, although that may be relevant depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. If, as her Honour found in the present case, the instruction given was to do acts which led by all physical necessity to a breach of the Act, there may be no significance in the fact that the landowner does not have control over the contractor's actions.

90The appellant sought and was granted leave to raise an additional ground of appeal, identified as Ground 6A, which was pleaded as follows:

Ground 6A: The primary judge erred in finding that the instructions given by Mr Fife to ELC were sufficient to amount to a direction to do an act that would lead by all physical necessity, or inexorably and inevitably, to the clearing of native vegetation. The primary judge therefore erred in finding that the defendant is vicariously liable for the acts of ELC.

91The additional ground of appeal is difficult to distinguish from Grounds 5 and 6. The essence of the additional submission was to the effect that her Honour should have found that the instructions given by Mr Fife to ELC did no more than create a ""mere risk"" that the relevant event would occur. A finding to that effect was made by Pain J in Environment Protection Authority v McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd [2003] NSWLEC 70; (2003) 128 LGERA 240 at [119].

92The appellant accepts, as it was obliged to do, that ELC were instructed to ""tidy up the property"" and remove ""small undergrowth"" or ""regrowth."" Her Honour found that these descriptors referred to native vegetation and accordingly any suggestion that the instruction gave rise only to a ""mere risk"" that the relevant event would occur is untenable. Her Honour found, as I have previously indicated, that the appellant did not rely on ELC's alleged environmental expertise. For those reasons, this ground of appeal fails.

Ground 7: The primary judge erred in holding that the Court was entitled to draw an inference as to the area of land cleared and reached erroneous conclusions (about) the environmental impact of the offence in circumstances where the quantum and location of the seven species of native vegetation cleared was unknown and not proved.

Ground 8: The primary Judge imposed a penalty that was excessive in the circumstances.

93It is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal against sentence together. The appellant's submissions on these grounds are based on much the same reasoning as its submissions on Ground 1, namely that the prosecutor inadequately particularised the charges against the appellant. According to the appellant, the consequence must be that the primary judge sentenced the appellant on an evidentiary foundation that did not distinguish between ""native vegetation"" (the only possible subject of the charge under the Act) and ""non-native vegetation"" (the clearing of which was not captured by the relevant offence provision).

94This submission is without merit. As I have found in relation to Ground 1, s 6(2) permitted the primary judge to draw the inference that the entirety of the 23 ha of land was ""native vegetation"" on the basis that the seven identified species were dispersed throughout the parcel of land. As Ground 1 fails, Grounds 7 and 8 must also fail to the extent that they rely on the same reasoning. In any event, the following remarks by her Honour at [85]-[86] of the judgment on sentence show that she had due regard to the dispersal of the seven species throughout the 23 ha of land:

""Walker is correct in its submission that it is impossible to accurately calculate how many hectares of the seven species of native vegetation that it actually cleared. Put another way, it is not the case that 23 ha of the seven species of native vegetation listed in the summons were cleared by Walker and I have not taken this into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Walker.

But while the precise amount of the seven species cleared by Walker cannot be ascertained, the Court is nevertheless permitted to draw an inference, based on the available evidence, which includes the evidence of Mr Turner and Mr Lembit, as to the environmental impact of the commission of the offence. That is to say, while the quantum of the seven species of native vegetation cleared is a relevant matter for the Court to consider - and because in the present circumstances this cannot be precisely ascertained any doubt must be resolved in favour of Walker - this is but one component of the overall environmental harm that the Court must determine has been caused by the commission of the offence."" (emphasis added)

95There remains the issue of whether the sentencing exercise miscarried because her Honour expressed the erroneous view that ""native vegetation"" includes dead plant matter. I do not believe that it did. There is no indication that the primary judge took into account the appellant's clearing of dead plant matter when imposing sentence. Indeed, it is telling that the appellant's written submissions with respect to Grounds 7 and 8 do not complain that her Honour gave any weight to dead plant matter in the sentencing exercise. In any event, the $200,000 penalty imposed was modest in comparison with the maximum penalty of $1,100,000 and consistent with the gravity of the appellant's conduct. This further supports the conclusion that her Honour did not take the clearing of dead plant matter into account in such a way as to cause the sentencing exercise to miscarry.

96Although the penalty is modest in comparison to the maximum available penalty, I accept that the $200,000 fine is nevertheless high as compared with the fines typically imposed for this type of offence. Counsel for the respondent drew this Court's attention to Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256, where the Land and Environment Court imposed a $400,000 penalty on a farmer who bulldozed 450 ha of wetlands, contrary to s 12(1) of the Act. Lloyd J described the offence (at [75]) as being ""at the upper range of seriousness since it was done deliberately and after the defendant had been expressly told ... that native trees must be retained on the land"". His Honour noted a number of other sentencing decisions in relation to contraventions of provisions similar to s 12, including:


Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Taylor [2007] NSWLEC 530, where Lloyd J imposed a fine of $30,000 following the offender's plea of guilty to a charge of clearing 30 ha of native vegetation, contrary to the then s 21(2) of the Act;
Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297, where Biscoe J imposed a fine of $40,000 following a plea of guilty to two counts of unlawfully clearing approximately 13 ha of native vegetation, again contrary to what was then s 21(2) of the Act;
Minister for Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317; (2004) 136 LGERA 89, where Sackville J fined an individual and corporation $150,000 and $300,000 respectively for deliberately clearing approximately 100 ha on a NSW property, contrary to s 16(1) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth). The maximum penalty was $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a corporation. Sackville J's decision was affirmed on appeal to the Full Federal Court: Greentree v Minister for the Environment and Heritage [2005] FCAFC 128; (2005) 143 LGERA 1.

97To these decisions may be added:


Director-General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water v Linklater [2011] NSWLEC 30, where Preston CJ imposed a sentence of $82,500 on an individual who pleaded guilty to clearing about 166 ha of native vegetation in an area not authorised to be cleared, contrary to the then s 21(2) of the Act;
Director-General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water v Vin Heffernan Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 200, where Pepper J (the primary judge) imposed a sentence of $30,150 on a corporation that pleaded guilty to a charge of clearing 86 ha of native vegetation, contrary to s 12 of the Act;
Department of Environment and Climate Change (NSW) v Calman Australia Pty Ltd [2009] NSWLEC 182, where Pain J imposed a fine of $22,000 on each of three corporations that pleaded guilty to clearing 21 ha of land, contrary to s 12 of the Act;
Director-General, Department of Environment Climate Change and Water v Ian Colley Earthmoving Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 102, where an individual who pleaded guilty to clearing 12 ha of native vegetation, contrary to s 12 of the Act, was fined $5,000, the fine being reduced from $20,000 in recognition of the offender's poor financial circumstances;
Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Rae [2009] NSWLEC 137; (2009) 168 LGERA 121, where the offender, who pleaded guilty to partially clearing 215 ha of native vegetation, of which 155 ha was cleared of over 95 per cent of all trees, contrary to s 12 of the Act, was fined the sum of $160,000; and
Olmwood, where the Court imposed a fine of $100,000 on a corporate offender that was found guilty of clearing nine species of native vegetation within 10.1ha of land, in breach of s 12 of the Act.

98A purely quantitative analysis of the above decisions - many of which were cited by the primary judge at [135]-[146] of the judgment on sentence - suggests that the penalty imposed in this case was excessive. To my mind, however, the primary judge did not misjudge the seriousness of the offence or otherwise impose an excessive sentence. This Court cannot determine the appropriateness of the sentence by way of a superficial comparison of the sentence imposed on the appellant with the sentences imposed on offenders who cleared similarly sized parcels of land. That approach risks giving undue weight to the quantum of cleared native vegetation in the sentencing exercise, in much the same way that the guideline judgment in R v Wong and Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 at [134] gave undue weight to the quantity of imported narcotics in the sentencing of drug offenders: Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [73]-[74] (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ). Indeed, in many if not most of the decisions on sentence cited above, the offenders had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, assisted the authorities, or expressed contrition or remorse. The quantum of native vegetation cleared is an important consideration in the sentencing of offenders for offences against s 12 of the Act, but it is not the only one.

99The primary judge correctly identified (at [23] and [149] of the judgment on sentence) that her task was to instinctively synthesise the considerations relevant to the sentence, of which the amount of native vegetation cleared was but one factor among many: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [35]-[39]. Her Honour also correctly identified at [135] that the consistency which sentencing law strives to achieve is consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles, not consistency of outcome: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [18], [48]-[49]. After reviewing previous sentencing decisions, her Honour identified characteristics in those decisions that warranted a more lenient sentence being imposed than in the present case (at [148]):

""Although the areas found to have been cleared in the present case are relevantly analogous to that in Calman and Colley, a number of distinguishing features warrant a considerably less lenient sentence than in either of those two decisions. First, in the present case Walker committed the offence recklessly and its culpability is measurably higher. Second, Walker did not plead guilty. Third, Walker has expressed no contrition or remorse for its unlawful acts. Fourth, Walker neither cooperated nor assisted the prosecuting authorities. Fifth, there is no evidence that Walker is of limited financial means.""

100Whether this Court would have imposed the same or a similar penalty in the circumstances is immaterial: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5. It was open to her Honour to give significant weight to such factors as the appellant's moral culpability and the need for general and specific deterrence (at [131]-[133]) in imposing the penalty that she did. I can see no error in her approach.

101Both grounds of appeal against sentence fail.

Orders

102The appeal is dismissed.

103HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

104GARLING J: As the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL demonstrate, the judgment of the trial judge has not been demonstrated to be, in any way, erroneous.

105Consequently, I too would dismiss the appeal.

2760179,Quinn v Coal Mine Services Pty Limited [2012] NSWSC 1158,"Judgment

1On 19 April 2007 the plaintiff, who was then employed by the first defendant (Coal Mine Services) at Mandalong Mine, which was operated by the second defendant (Centennial), fell and injured his back. The plaintiff sues both defendants for damages in negligence.

2The plaintiff was working on a machine known as an ABM 25 CM 0086 Continuous Miner (the Miner). The Miner is a cut and bolt miner. It has a revolving retractable mechanism at the front known as a cutter because it cuts the coal ahead of it. 

3The Miner is equipped with a rib bolter and a roof bolter, each of which is used by bolt operators to insert metal bolts into the wall (referred to as the rib) or the roof of the cavity, as the case may be. When conditions require, as it did in the instant case, Tensar mesh is bolted to the roof or rib of the mine. Different combinations of bolt patterns and mesh placement are employed to stabilise the mine's structure and to guard against rib falls and rib spall.

4The bolting work is done from a platform behind the cutter on the Miner. The surface of the platform is made of steel plate, with a non-slip steel chequerboard surface treatment. The platform can be extended outward, on either side of the Miner, to increase its surface area. The platform extensions for each side operate independently. The lever which extends or retracts the platform is in the same control panel as the rib bolter.

5There is a rib shield or sprag which is a piece of flat metal which stands at the outside of the platform extension directly opposite the roof bolter valve bank and is designed to protect the roof bolter operator from rib falls when bolts are inserted into the roof of the cavity. 

6There is a bolt cassette on the Miner which holds bolts and other material to be used by the bolt operators. 

7There are four people on the crew of a Miner: two on either side. On the left side, there is a bolter, so-called because he inserts the bolts into the roof or the rib, and an off-sider, who assists the bolter. On the right side, there is a driver and the bolter operator.

8When the Miner is moving forward, known as tramming, the platform extensions are retracted and the crew members remain on the Miner unless for some reason the offsider needs to collect material, such as new bolts or mesh, from the area behind the Miner.

9When the Miner is cutting, the platform extensions are extended to enlarge the working area on which the bolt operators work. The bolting occurs simultaneously with the cutting. The Miner is stationary while bolting and cutting is conducted, although the force of the cutting causes it to vibrate. While cutting is occurring the coal that is cut from the front runs out of the conveyor in the middle of the Miner. 

10It is common ground that work on machines such as the Miner requires persons to be alert at all times to conditions concerning the ribs and roof of the mine and also those concerning the Miner itself, including whether the platform is wet and therefore more slippery than when dry.

11It is common ground that rib conditions at the time of the accident were such as to require Tensar mesh to be applied to the roof and the rib of the cavity to support it and protect those passing through the cavity from falling coal or other debris that could make passage unsafe.

12It is common ground that the plaintiff was, as at the time of the accident, an experienced coal miner of approximately eight years' experience. He had received induction training prior to working at Mandalong which involved instruction concerning hazards, including those relating to machines and those relating to the mining conditions. He commenced working at the Mandalong Mine on 5 February 2007. 

13The plaintiff and Mr Broderick were working on the left side of the Miner on 19 April 2007. Towards the end of the afternoon shift on 19 April 2007 the plaintiff fell from the platform of the Miner to the ground below and jarred his back. 

The plaintiff's case

14One of the principal issues in the case is how the accident occurred. The versions given by the plaintiff are considered in more detail below. I propose at the outset to record the way in which the plaintiff's case was pleaded and opened before me before setting out how it changed in the course of the proceedings.

15Paragraph [4] of the Second Amended Statement of Claim (which was inserted into the pleading by Amended Statement of Claim filed on 26 March 2010) reads:

""On 19 April 2007, the Plaintiff, during and in the course of his employment with the First Defendant, at the Second Defendant's premises, at Main Gate 5, was part of a production crew and was standing on the left hand side of [the Miner] when the rib fell in, whereupon the Plaintiff in attempting to avoid being caught between the rib and [the Miner] stepped off [the Miner], falling to the ground below in consequence of which the Plaintiff suffered severe injury, loss and damage.""

16The particulars of negligence against Coal Mine Services included:

""(d) Failing to ensure that [the Miner] had rail(s) or an additional rib sprag to reduce the risk of slips/ trips from the work platform.""

17The particulars of negligence against Centennial included:

""(f) Failing to warn the Plaintiff that the work platform on [the Miner] had been retracted.

(g) Failing to provide rail(s) or an additional rib sprag to [the Miner] as a means to reduce the risk of slips/ trips from the work platform.""

18Mr Benson, counsel for the plaintiff, opened the case by saying that the plaintiff was preparing to bolt when a large piece of rib came away from the rib and shattered. The plaintiff was startled and stepped back in response and fell off the Miner because there was no means of restraint. The plaintiff's case, as opened, was that reasonable care required the defendants to install another rib sprag or railing on the side of the machine and that this would have prevented the fall.

19In the plaintiff's statement dated 23 March 2012, which was tendered as his evidence in chief, he said:

""At about 10.50 pm on 19 April 2007 I heard a loud noise and observed the rib falling and instinctively stepped back... and unfortunately off the side of the continuous miner although in the process my left leg was grazed by the shattered rib fall.""

20It can thus be seen that the plaintiff's case at trial was that there was a rib fall which startled him and caused him to step backwards. Because there was no impediment to his stepping backwards, he stepped off the platform, lost his balance and landed on the ground below the platform.

How the accident happened

21Over time, the plaintiff has given various versions of the way in which the accident occurred. The first version was given in an accident/ incident investigation report form that he filled on in 24 April 2007 (the Incident Report) in which he said:

""Describe specific activity of employee at time of incident: Getting ready to bolt up.

Describe how incident occurred: Set up rib mesh ready to start bolting but when stepped back I fell backwards off side of miner, left leg and side fell to floor whilst rest of body was still on miner.""

22There was no mention of a rib fall in the Incident Report. In later versions, including in his evidence before me referred to above, the plaintiff identified the rib fall as being the precipitating event, which startled him and caused him to fall backwards.

23The plaintiff's evidence at trial was that a rib of the dimensions 1.5 metres x 1-2 metres x 400 millimetres fell and startled him and caused him to step backwards. He said that the rib shattered when it hit the ground.

24The defendants relied on the evidence of Mr Broderick, who was working as an off-sider to the plaintiff at the time of the accident. Mr Broderick had disembarked from the Miner in order to retrieve further materials from the area behind the Miner. He was returning to the Miner when he saw the plaintiff fall. He said that the light cast by his own cap lamp, the plaintiff's cap lamp and the light from the boom of the Miner was sufficient for him to see what happened.

25Mr Broderick saw the plaintiff walk to the bolt cassette, retrieve some material from the bolt cassette and then turn to go back towards the front of the Miner. He saw the plaintiff take a step with his left foot, which slipped out and off the platform causing him to slip off to the left. His left foot went to the ground and the right foot stayed on the Miner. His body was tilted towards the rib of the mine. 

26Mr Broderick was 6-8 metres away from the plaintiff when he fell. He could not see any substantial rib spall either before or after the accident. In particular he did not see any rib spall of the dimensions 1.5 metres x 1-2 metres x 400 millimetres. Nor did he see any rib fall that caused the plaintiff to step in the way that he did. He said that the plaintiff did not step backwards.

27Mr Broderick said that the platform from which the plaintiff fell was relatively close to the ground because the jacks that lifted it had not yet been activated. He estimated that the height of the platform at that location would have been in the order of 450-550 millimetres. Mr Latter, the bolt operator on the right side of the Miner on the relevant shift, estimated the height to be about 350-400 millimetres.

28At the time of the accident the platform extension had been retracted. Mr Broderick did not recall whether he or the plaintiff had retracted the platform, but he considered it to be more likely that it was the plaintiff since the plaintiff was close to the controls where the lever to retract the platform was located. He also said that it was his usual if not invariable practice to tell his co-worker when he was retracting the platform since it was a matter of ""common courtesy"" as well as safety.

29The plaintiff told Mr Broderick that he had jarred his back. Mr Broderick observed that the plaintiff was in significant pain following the incident, which occurred near the end of the shift.

30Mr Watson, another employee of Centennial, gave evidence that Mr Broderick had told him, in the course of the subsequent investigation of the accident, that he had retracted the platform. I have doubts about the reliability of Mr Watson's evidence since it seems improbable that someone who was not an eyewitness and who had not been asked to recall the accident investigation until the time of the hearing, some five and a half years after the accident, would recall not only what Mr Broderick had said but also the context in which he said it. However, I do not consider that it matters whether it was the plaintiff himself or Mr Broderick who retracted the platform since in either event I am satisfied that the plaintiff knew, prior to the accident, that the platform had been retracted.

31I did not form the impression that the different versions given by the plaintiff were necessarily the product of dishonesty. However, I consider it to be more likely that when he was filling in the Incident Report he did so accurately and with a view to informing his employer and his co-workers of what had actually happened to him. Had there been a rib fall which caused him to fall, I am satisfied that he would have referred to it in the Incident Report.

32The plaintiff relied on records that established that there had been several rib falls in that area of the mine in the preceding days. Mr Latter recalled that a couple of times during the shift Mr Broderick told the crew that they would have to reverse because some of the rib had fallen out. However he was not aware of the timing of such rib falls referable to the plaintiff's accident. Mr Broderick explained that such rib falls could be caused by the bolting operation itself as well as other factors, including flaws in the mine. Although Mr McBlane, who was then the shift deputy, does not recall the rib conditions for the relevant shift, he did not recall them to be particularly poor at the time; nor does his Underground Report for the relevant time record them to be so, although earlier reports had noted particular dangers. For example, the report for the afternoon shift on the previous day had recorded:

""Very poor ribs - spalling up to 1 m - caution required.""

33I do not accept that there was a rib fall which caused the plaintiff to step back as he did.

34I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence that another employee told him what to write on the Incident Report. Although the practice was that employees who had had incidents were not supposed to fill in such a form themselves, the plaintiff did so on this occasion and handed the partly-filled-in form to Mr McBlane. The plaintiff's evidence that Mr Watson told him what to write on the form was not elicited in chief; rather it was given when he was cross-examined about his assessment of the conditions in the mine as being ""good"". When Mr Watson was called, it was not suggested that he had told the plaintiff how to fill in the form. Although it was put to Mr McBlane (who was recalled for that purpose) that he had filled it in, he denied it and recalled that the form had been handed to him after the plaintiff had filled it in.

35By the time the plaintiff made a statement for the purposes of the proceedings, some five years had passed and his recollection was no longer sufficient for him to recall what had happened. He may also have been unwittingly influenced by contemporaneous reports of mine conditions which indicated that there had been rib falls in that period and in that area, although his own assessment on his accident investigation form was that conditions were good.

36I consider Mr Broderick to be a reliable witness who was in a good position to see what had happened. Although he had been employed by Centennial, his evidence was not, in my view, affected by any allegiance to it. At the time of the hearing he was retired. He appeared to be very sympathetic to the plaintiff's plight and yet did not allow his affection to deflect him from giving his evidence truthfully. As the following passage demonstrates, he was a reluctant witness in that he would have preferred not to have seen what happened.

""Q. When you saw him, he was facing away from you? 
A. He had walked towards me a little. We are talking only of a few seconds here. And he had gone, reached into the cassette and turned around to go back to the face, and he slipped. It's as it turned out it's the wrong few seconds for me to look up, otherwise I would be at home.""

37I accept Mr Broderick's account of the way in which the accident occurred, which is set out above.

38In summary, I find that the accident occurred when the plaintiff's left foot slipped off the edge of the platform. It was not caused or precipitated by any rib fall. Nor was the plaintiff, at the time of the fall, unaware that the platform had been retracted. The cause of the fall was the plaintiff's inadvertence. (At the time the plaintiff fell, the platform was in the order of 450-550 millimetres off the ground).


Duty of care owed to the plaintiff

39The duty Centennial owed to the plaintiff is substantially the same as if he had been Centennial's employee: Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1; 160 CLR 16 at 31, per Mason J. Although the plaintiff was employed by Coal Mine Services and his co-workers were employed by Centennial, it is difficult to see that there would be any material difference in the way in which Centennial treated and directed the plaintiff had he been one of its employees. Centennial had a right, which it exercised, to control the plaintiff in the work he performed on its behalf and for its benefit. The duty Centennial owed to the plaintiff was akin to that which would have been owed had he been an employee, namely a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing him to the risk of injury: Rockdale Beef Pty Ltd v Carey [2003] NSWCA 132 at [94], per Ipp JA (Mason P and McColl JA agreeing). It owed a non-delegable duty to the plaintiff to prescribe and provide a safe system of work: TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; 65 NSWLR 1 (TNT) at [41], per Mason P and at [178], per Foster AJA. 

40However, Coal Mine Services continued to owe a non-delegable duty of care to the plaintiff as its employee. The following statement from Mason P's judgment in TNT, at [67] concerning the labour-hire company, Manpower, also applies, in my view, to Coal Mine Services:

""In my view, it would be contrary to principle to enable or even to encourage an employer that operates a labour hire business to treat the normal incidents of the employment relationship as modified simply because its employees are sent off to work for a client. Indeed, the very fact that employees are dispatched to external venues and placed under the de facto management of outsiders will, in some cases, have the practical effect of requiring the employer to adopt additional measures by way of warning or training in order to discharge its continuing common law duty of care to its employees.""




Were the defendants negligent?

41The Civil Liability Act 2002 (the Act) applies to the accident. Section 5B of the Act provides:

""5B General principles

(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless: 

(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b) the risk was not insignificant, and

(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.

(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things): 

(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.""

42Centennial, when it purchased two Miners, subjected the machines to risk assessments, which were reviewed and revised over time. No challenge was made to the adequacy of these risk assessments. Although the risk assessments were, on their face, rigorous, there is scant reference to the risk of falling. The relevant hazard was identified as ""slip trip fall accessing the platforms"". The existing control was identified as ""Step heights within maximum limits to standards"". The findings identified the following as a ""high loss issue"":

""(Fall from); Step from/ slip off deck when on the working platform - leading to a LTI [lost time incident]. Controlled by relatively low height, broken coal in vicinity during operations and limited number of people on deck. Also reduced by the number of designed holders for gear (chemical holders etc.)""

43Accordingly, the risk assessments demonstrate that the issue was considered by an appropriate panel of experts who came to the view that the existing controls were adequate and did not make recommendations to the effect of the matters which the plaintiff contended reasonable care required; namely installation of guard rails or other protective devices.

44Centennial also relied on the expert opinion of Professor Hebblewhite, a consultant mining engineer, whose evidence was not challenged. The plaintiff did not rely on expert evidence, although he had obtained and served reports by a Mr Stothard. 

45Professor Hebblewhite refuted the proposition that the defendants had been negligent in exposing the plaintiff to a risk of injury and said:

""The Defendant provided a safe piece of equipment and an appropriate and comprehensive set of procedures to enable it to be operated in a safe manner such that with due care and attention to relevant procedures and training, the risk of injury was at an acceptably low level.""

46Professor Hebblewhite also refuted the proposition that the defendants were negligent in failing to provide some means of guarding the plaintiff and others from the effect of rib falls and said:

""There was no continuous guarding along the side of the work platform, since it was a retractable platform; and it was at a height where guarding was not required. The protection from the effect of rib falls was primarily through appropriate procedures; plus the safe standing position for the operator whilst installing rib support; plus the equipment used for rib support.""

47In response to the plaintiff's contention that handrails should have been fitted and may have prevented the plaintiff from stepping back off the platform, Professor Hebblewhite said:

""Whilst this may be correct, it is understood that the height of the platform did not require the fitting of handrails.""

48The relevant risk for the purposes of s 5B of the Act was that a worker in the position of the plaintiff would miss his footing and/or lose his balance from the platform and fall to the ground. The risk was foreseeable and not insignificant in that there is always the possibility that such an event might occur, particularly in circumstances where lighting, though adequate, is not bright and the surface area of the platform changes from time to time depending on whether the platform is retracted or extended.

49However, the persons working on the Miner were trained to do so and had been inducted in its use. The height of the platform above ground was not obviously such as to warrant a rail to guard against falls. The likely seriousness of the harm suffered if there was no guardrail was relatively small. Furthermore there is nothing to suppose that the placing of a guard rail to protect against the risk which ensued when the plaintiff lost its footing would not have given rise to other risks which were greater and potentially more serious.

50For these reasons I am not satisfied that either of the defendants breached the duty of care which it owed to the plaintiff by not installing guardrails or any other guarding. This is sufficient to deal with the plaintiff's case as pleaded and opened.

The plaintiff's revised case: retraction of the platform

51In the course of the hearing, the plaintiff's case changed. The significance of rib fall, which had been pleaded and opened as the precipitating event, was minimised and a new contention was developed, which was articulated by Mr Benson in final submissions: that Mr Broderick had retracted the platform without telling the plaintiff that he had done so and that this was why the plaintiff stepped backwards and fell.

52The kernel of a new case was contained in the particular of negligence (f) alleged against Centennial: namely, that it had failed to warn the plaintiff that the platform had been retracted. This particular had been added to the pleading by leave granted on the first day of the trial. Although it was not opened, I will nonetheless deal with it since it was explored to some extent in the evidence and the parties addressed me on it.

53The genesis of the new ground appears to have been an entry in the Incident Report which identified, in Section B2: Recommendations, the following action:

""Communication issue - 2nd operator retracted the platform to full location - 1st operator was not aware of this function being done.""

54Although several employees of Centennial were called, none had written the entry set out above. It was not established who had written it. The plaintiff contended that it was a business record because it was contained in the records of Centennial. Centennial submitted that this part of the document was not admissible to prove the fact as I could not be satisfied that the person who wrote the entry had personal knowledge of what was set out and relied on s 69(2) of the Evidence Act 1995. It submitted that in circumstances where the only two people who could have known what had happened, the plaintiff and Mr Broderick, were called to give evidence, their evidence provided the most reliable account of what happened. 

55Centennial also relied on Lithgow City Council v Jackson [2011] HCA 36; 224 CLR 352 to support its contention that the statement was inadmissible as hearsay and not admissible under s 78 of the Evidence Act as a lay opinion. 

56In my view there were effectively three statements of fact in the entry:

(1)The second operator (Mr Broderick) retracted the platform;

(2)The first operator (the plaintiff) was not aware that the platform had been retracted; and

(3)Mr Broderick's act of retracting the platform had not been communicated to the plaintiff.

57There was also, arguably, a statement of opinion, namely that there was a ""communication issue"" although this, in my view, is more accurately characterised as a comment or conclusion. Presumably, the plaintiff also relied on the entry for its inferential possibilities: namely, that the plaintiff fell because Mr Broderick had not told him that he had retracted the platform and the plaintiff did not otherwise know that the platform had been retracted.

58There was no evidence that either the plaintiff or Mr Broderick had told the unidentified person who wrote the entry of any of these matters. Although the Court is obliged to draw such inferences as are available from the document, I do not consider in the circumstances referred to above that I ought draw the inference that the person who filled out Section B2 had spoken either to the plaintiff or to Mr Broderick before filling it in.

59Accordingly, I reject Section B2 in so far as it is to be used for a hearsay purpose. It is not admissible as opinion evidence. 

60It is therefore necessary to review, at least in broad terms, the evidence that might otherwise support the plaintiff's new case: that it was the unexpected retraction of the platform by Mr Broderick that caused his fall.

61The plaintiff's evidence in chief on the matter was contained in [23] of his statement dated 23 March 2012:

""Unbeknown to me the platform upon which I was standing (which was retractable) had been fully retracted although I was not aware of this at the time. I am unaware as to who it was who retracted the platform. This is only usually done when moving forward in coal cutting operations. The effect of this is to reduce the standing area in the position that I was in.""

62There was considerable cross-examination on this topic, as well as other versions of the accident. However when the passage set out above was put directly to the plaintiff, his answer demonstrated that he did not even appreciate that he had ever given such a version of events. The exchange was as follows:

""Q. You've said that somebody unbeknowns to you retracted the platform? 
A. Have I said that have I? 

Q. You have said that. You don't remember saying that?
A. No, I don't.""

63In cross-examination, the plaintiff denied retracting the platform himself after Mr Broderick had finished roof bolting but said he was unaware whether Mr Broderick had retracted the platform. He also said:

""Q. That is if the platform had been retracted you would have, in preparing to bolt up, have been able to see that it had been retracted, correct? 
A. Well, I probably just assumed that Lenny [Broderick] had left it out when he bolted. 

Q. My question is a bit different though. Because of the position which you were working you were able to see with your own eyes whether or not the platform was retracted or extended, correct?
A. Well, you're not necessarily looking down all the time at either platform extended or retracted. You're more looking at the conditions you're working in.""

64In the various histories the plaintiff gave to Centennial and to doctors, the first history that is in evidence that refers to the platform being retracted was the history recorded by Dr Rushworth on 2 December 2008, in his report of 7 December 2008 as follows:

""On this date, he was working underground, fixing mesh to a tunnel wall. He was standing on a machine, and the driver of the machine retracted the platform onto which Mr Quinn was about to step.""

65When this history was put to the plaintiff in cross-examination he said:

""A. No, I wouldn't have told him that because the driver can't operate the platform on the other side of the miner. He can only operate his side... 

Q. Did you tell Doctor Rushworth, if we put the driver to one side, that somebody had retracted the platform onto which you were about to step?
A. Not that I can recall. I can't even recall attending that meeting and when it was and where it was.""

66Dr Rushworth was not a treating doctor. He had been retained by the workers compensation insurer and had been provided with copies of certain relevant documents, not all of which were identified. Although the Incident Report was not identified in terms, it would fall within the category of documents that would be likely to be submitted to a doctor retained for that purpose. Although it was not explored in the evidence, it is at least possible that the provenance of the facts recorded by Dr Rushworth was Section B2 of the Incident Report itself, rather than what the plaintiff told him. At all events, the plaintiff did not accept the history recorded by Dr Rushworth as being true or that he had given such a history.

67Indeed when the plaintiff was cross-examined about the histories he had given to various doctors he said, in answer to a question about what he had told Dr Shatwell:

""I don't recall what I told him. I would have told him the same story I just said all along that I avoided getting hit by the rib.""

68The plaintiff was cross-examined about a file note dated 26 November 2009 which recorded a conference between the plaintiff and his legal representatives. Relevantly, the file note records:

""Platform had been 'drawn in' because they were going to move forward.""

69Mr Broderick's evidence on the topic is set out above. For the reasons given I am not satisfied that Mr Broderick retracted the platform, or that if he did, he did not tell the plaintiff that he had done so. Further, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff did not know that the platform had been retracted. I am also not satisfied that, even if the platform had been retracted, it had anything to do with the plaintiff's fall.

70The plaintiff has failed to establish that any act or omission on the part of either of the defendants was negligent or causative of his fall. Accordingly, the plaintiff must fail.

71However, although I have found that the defendants are not liable to the plaintiff, it is desirable that I proceed to make findings as to damages: Wolfenden v International Theme Park Pty Limited [2008] NSWCA 78 at [6], per Giles JA. I have done so on the hypothetical basis had I found both defendants liable.

Assessment of damages

Findings of fact

72The plaintiff's earning capacity at the time of the accident was $1,350 net per week. He was, as a result of his fall, unable to continue with his usual duties. He had time off work after the accident and returned to work to perform alternative duties, which included spray painting, grinding and general cleaning. He performed alternate duties at the mine itself and also at a workshop operated by Coal Mine Services at Tomago. Although he did not return to full-time work, he did manage to work seven-hour shifts on three consecutive days.

73During the period after the accident he had treatment which included physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and lumbar nerve blocks. The transforaminal injections provided some relief of temporary symptoms in his left leg.

74Prior to 19 April 2007 the plaintiff was a very keen golfer and had a handicap of two. Because of the injuries he sustained to his back on that date, he has been unable to play golf, which is a matter of considerable regret to him.

75On 18 February 2008, the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident. The force of the impact caused the pain in his back to increase substantially. The plaintiff returned to light duties on 25 March 2008. He last performed physical work for Coal Mining Services in February 2009. On 11 May 2009, the plaintiff was admitted to St George Hospital where he underwent a L4/5 disc replacement and a L5/S1 anterior lumbar fusion.

76Coal Mining Services terminated his employment on 29 October 2009. The plaintiff was upset by this termination and sought that his employer reconsider its decision since he believed and hoped that he would be able to manage some form of alternate duties. The plaintiff became depressed as a result of his disabilities and his incapacity for work.

77He attributed the loss of his relationship with his partner in December 2009 to his inability to deal with his injury, the change in his lifestyle and the reduction in his income occasioned by his being on workers compensation benefits rather than his full wage.

78From the time of the termination of his employment until the date of trial, the plaintiff has neither sought nor engaged in remunerative employment.

79The plaintiff subsequently commenced a course of study at TAFE in Community Services Work. He hopes to complete this course in November 2012 and expects to find full-time remunerative employment in that area from that time. He is confident of finding employment because there is a dearth of male community services workers and much demand for them, particularly as youth workers.

80It is common ground that the plaintiff is and will continue to be unfit for his pre-injury employment. 

Relative causation between the mining accident, the motor vehicle accident and an underlying degenerative back condition

81The most significant issue in the quantification of damages is the extent to which the plaintiff's accident the subject of the proceedings is causative of his present and future diminution in earning capacity. The other factors which are said to contribute to the ongoing diminution are: first, the plaintiff's pre-existing degenerative condition, which was, prior to the accident, asymptomatic; and secondly, the motor vehicle accident in February 2008. 

82The plaintiff has established a prima facie causal connection between the injuries he sustained in Centennial's mine on 19 April 2007 and his continuing incapacity. The defendants submitted that the plaintiff's present incapacity was due both to a pre-existing degenerative condition and to the motor vehicle accident and spinal surgery, which they submitted was itself a consequence of the motor vehicle accident. It is well established that a case such as the defendants propound requires evidence to prove the probable future effects of the progressive pre-existing condition and the supervening effects of the motor vehicle accident with a reasonable degree of precision in order that their actual relationship to the incapacity can be assessed and determined: Watts v Rake [1960] HCA 58; 108 CLR 158.

83The parties tendered bundles of medical reports. None of the authors of such reports was required for cross-examination. This practice has been justly criticised: Austin v Director-General of Education (unreported, Court of Appeal: Kirby P, Clarke and Powell JJA, 21 July 1994) and Laxy v IBM Australia Pty Limited (1992) 35 FCR 79, at 86 per Ryan and Higgins JJ.

84There was no objection to the tender of any of the medical reports, except on the basis of Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; 108 CLR 642: namely that an opinion could only be established if the facts on which it was based were established by evidence.





Expert medical evidence relied upon by the plaintiff in relation to relative causation

85Professor Ghabrial, who was retained by the plaintiff's solicitors in January 2010, and whose reports were relied upon by the plaintiff, opined on the relative causation between the mining accident and the motor vehicle accident. He interviewed and examined the plaintiff on 12 January 2010 and 14 September 2011. In a report dated 31 August 2012, but which was prepared a little time after that date, Professor Ghabrial expressed the following opinion which was relied upon by the plaintiff:

""In summary I believe that Mr Quinn had an injury to his lower back on 19th April 2007 which was aggravated by the motor vehicle accident of February 2008. This made his symptoms worse although the initial damage was the result of the injury of 2007.

Regarding the back and left leg, it is my view that one fifth of the impairment is related to the injury of April 2007 and four fifths of the impairment is related to the motor vehicle accident of February 2008.""

86This opinion appears to be broadly consistent with the various histories given by the plaintiff to his treating doctors which indicate that the plaintiff was improving after the mining accident until the motor vehicle accident but that the latter caused him to require spinal surgery, following which it was accepted that he could not return to his previous employment.

87Although Professor Ghabrial refers to the development of underlying degenerative changes, he does not opine on how their effect might be untangled from the effect of the mine accident and the motor vehicle accident. His opinion rests in part on the opinion of Dr Korber, radiologist, whose report was also tendered by the plaintiff.

88The plaintiff relied on the opinion of Dr Vote, spinal surgeon who opined in his report dated 15 February 2010 that his incapacity is ""directly due to the incident he describes as occurred in April of 2007"". I do not consider that this opinion ought be read as excluding the effects of the motor vehicle accident or as being necessarily inconsistent with Professor Ghabrial's opinion. The report of a Dr Lowy was also relied upon, but as he was not given a history of the motor vehicle accident, his opinion is not of particular assistance in determining relative causation.

Expert medical evidence relied upon by the defendants in relation to relative causation

89On the question of relative causation, the defendants relied on Dr Shatwell who opined that the fall in April 2007 caused an aggravation of an underlying degenerative condition and that the relative contribution made by the mining accident and the underlying condition was 10% and 90% respectively. Dr Shatwell considered that the plaintiff sustained a soft tissue injury on 19 April 2007, the effects of which would have settled within a matter of weeks or perhaps a month after that date.

90One of the impediments to an acceptance of Dr Shatwell's opinion is that it rests in part on his having formed an adverse view of the plaintiff's reliability as a historian in so far as he reported his incapacity. Dr Statwell adverted to the discrepancy between the plaintiff's clinical presentation and alleged incapacity and concluded that his main problem was ""motivation to return to remunerative employment"". Although I did not wholly accept the plaintiff's evidence on liability, I do not consider that he exaggerated his pain or disability in giving evidence. He admitted that he could do various things and that he had tried several activities. Although he had not played golf because of his back, he admitted that he had been camping and fishing.

91Of greater significance, however, is that Dr Shatwell's opinion was not put to Professor Ghabrial who was, as I have said above, not required for cross-examination. I have no means of assessing how Professor Ghabrial would have weighed any contribution of the underlying degenerative disease which the events of 19 April 2007 made symptomatic. I am therefore not prepared to accept Dr Shatwell's opinion since it was not fairly put to Professor Ghabrial.

Findings as to relative causation

92Professor Ghabrial's opinion touches on a topic which Dr Shatwell did not specifically address: namely the relationship between the causal effect of the mining accident and the motor vehicle accident. It is reasonable to infer that the defendants did not challenge Professor Ghabrial's opinion because they were prepared to accept it, in the event that I rejected Dr Shatwell's apportionment. Indeed the defendants' written submissions indicated and their oral submissions confirmed that they relied on Professor Ghabrial's opinion as a secondary case, if Dr Shatwell was not accepted.

93For these reasons, the fact that Professor Ghabrial was not cross-examined does not provide an impediment to acceptance of his views. Indeed it provides a further reason to make a finding in accordance with his opinion. That he did not opine on the effect of the underlying degenerative condition means that the defendants have not discharged the onus that rests on them by reason of the statements of principle from Watts v Rake referred to above to establish its relative contribution.

94Accordingly, I accept Professor Ghabrial's opinion, which effectively became, once Dr Shatwell was rejected, common ground. I find that the incapacity suffered by the plaintiff from 19 April 2007 until 18 February 2008 was due to the fall in April 2007. For the month after his motor vehicle accident I find that his incapacity was caused wholly by the motor vehicle accident. After 18 March 2008, his incapacity was due to both causes, but from that time only 20% was due to the fall in April 2007 and 80% was due to the motor vehicle accident. 

Other issues relating to damages: apportionment between defendants

95Once relative causation has been determined, the mathematical calculations relating to damages have been substantially agreed. It was also agreed between the parties that the defendants' damages ought be apportioned such that Coal Mining Services is 20% responsible and Centennial is 80% responsible.

Damages for non-economic loss

96I consider that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff on 19 April 2007 warrant an award of non-economic loss of 25% of the most extreme case. Since the plaintiff's entitlement for a lump sum for permanent impairment as against the first defendant derives from the Workers Compensation Act 1987, he is entitled to 20% (being Coal Mining Services' share) of 25% of $256,900, which is $12,845 from Coal Mining Services. His entitlement to non-economic loss against Centennial derives from s 16 of the Act. He is entitled to 80% (being Centennial's share) of the amount recoverable for 25% of a most extreme case. This amount, by reference to the scale, is $33,800. 80% of that figure is $27,040.

Past loss of earning capacity

97It is common ground that the plaintiff was unable to work either wholly or partly for various periods from the date of the mining accident, 19 April 2007, until 18 February 2008, being the date of the motor vehicle accident. This amount is agreed at $41,825, of which Coal Mining Services is liable for $8,365 and Centennial is liable for $33,460.

98I find that the plaintiff's inability to work in the month following the motor vehicle accident was entirely attributable to that accident. Accordingly, his total net loss for the period from 18 February 2008 until 18 March 2008 of $5,400 is not recoverable from either defendant.

99During the period from 18 March 2008 until 11 May 2009, being the date of his spinal operation, the plaintiff was partly incapacitated for work. His loss of earnings for that period is agreed at $61,150, of which 20% is due to the fall in April 2007, as distinct from the motor vehicle accident. Of the $12,230, Coal Mining Services is responsible for $2,446 and Centennial is responsible for $9,784, in accordance with the agreed apportionment.

100There is an issue between the parties about the extent of the plaintiff's incapacity for work after the spinal surgery. The plaintiff's case is that he was wholly incapacitated and that he has endeavoured to retrain himself for an occupation that will be sustainable, having regard to his physical incapacity. The defendants' case is that the plaintiff has a greater earning capacity than he asserted and that he could have worked during the period after the spinal surgery and up to the date of trial.

101The defendants sought to establish that there were other more remunerative options available to the plaintiff other than the one he has chosen and for which he has been trained. The defendants relied on vocational assessments whose authors opined that the plaintiff might able to drive a forklift or work in a warehouse. The authors of these assessments were not called. The histories they were given were materially different from the plaintiff's evidence. I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has a greater sustainable earning capacity than he will have as a youth counsellor. Furthermore, I consider that the plaintiff's prospects of being able to work full-time for the rest of his working life depend on his having a position in which he can stand and sit at will, as I infer he will be able to do as a Community Services worker. None of the options identified by the authors of the vocational assessment reports apparently provided this flexibility.

102Although I consider that the plaintiff could have exercised some earning capacity through the period from the date of the surgery to the date of trial, I find that his decision to undertake a course that would qualify him for new employment in which he could engage for the rest of his working life was a reasonable one and one that was the result of the fall in April 2007. The evidence does not permit me to know exactly how much of this period of time was devoted to the TAFE course. However, I do not consider it to be reasonable to expect the plaintiff, who was recovering from significant spinal surgery, to jeopardise his recovery and his retraining by engaging in casual work even assuming that it had been available to him, having regard to his ongoing disabilities. I reject the defendants' submissions that he could have obtained casual work behind a bar. First, I do not consider such a position to be suitable for someone with the plaintiff's disabilities; and secondly, I am not satisfied that he would have been successful in obtaining such a position, having regard to his residual disabilities.

103For these reasons I find that the plaintiff's loss of earnings for the period from 11 May 2009 to the date of trial was as a result of the defendants' negligence. The amount for total incapacity for this period is agreed to be $228,150 of which 20% is attributable to the fall in April 2007, $45,630. Centennial is responsible for $36,504 and Coal Mining Services is responsible for $9,126, in accordance with the agreed apportionment.

104The plaintiff is entitled to interest under s 18 of the Act.

Future loss of earning capacity and future superannuation

105The plaintiff's residual earning capacity as a youth worker is presently in the order of half his uninjured earning capacity as a miner. However, it can reasonably be inferred that he will be able to work to a greater age as a community services worker than as a miner. Further, his services as a community services worker will be more likely to remain in demand than had he continued in his pre-injury occupation as a miner. Accordingly I consider it to be reasonable to allow for a 40% diminution of his earning capacity over his working life, rather than the 50% diminution claimed.

106I accept that the plaintiff intends to work to the age of 67. Accordingly, the multiplier is 822.

107The plaintiff's damages for loss of earning capacity in the future are, accordingly, $1,500 net per week x 822 x 40% less a discount of 15% for vicissitudes, namely $419,220 of which 20%, $83,844, is referable to the fall in April 2007. Of the total of $83,844, Coal Mining Services is responsible for $16,769 and Centennial is responsible for $67,075 in accordance with the agreed apportionment.

108Future superannuation is 11% of the net loss and is accordingly $9,223, of which Coal Mining Services is responsible for $1,845 and Centennial is responsible for $7,378.

Out of pocket expenses

109Past out of pocket expenses are agreed at $122,688. Of this sum, $18,840 is referable to the period from 18 April 2007 to 18 February 2008 and $104,381.61 is referable to the period from 18 February 2008 to date. Accordingly the whole of the amount for the former period and 20% of the amount for the latter period is recoverable from the defendants in accordance with the agreed apportionment.

110I allow a total of $5,000 for future out of pocket expenses for which the defendants are responsible in accordance with the agreed apportionment.

Fox v Wood component

111I record the parties' agreement that the taxation deducted from weekly benefits paid from 19 April 2007 to 18 February 2008 is $10,112 and the taxation deducted from weekly benefits paid from 18 February 2008 to date is $34,876.13.

Conclusions

2760186,Younan v Director of Public Prosecutions [2012] NSWDC 264,"Judgment

1The concept of what constitutes a document, and its capacity to play a relevant part in litigation by and large is governed by the Evidence Act 1995. Documents these days, to use an inexact cliché, ""come in all shapes and sizes"". A document can contain visual images and aural content, such as a video recorded interview; it may constitute a printout from a computer data base; diagrams and plans, or simply hand writing such as found in a last will and testament. Significantly, the source of a document and its content may well determine how its potential for relevant contribution to the evidence is to be assessed, thereby determining the ultimate question - ""Does the document have any capacity to play a relevant part in the litigation?"" 

2In the Local Court conviction appeal before me, the appellant, Raymond Younan objects to the Director of Public Prosecutions (respondent), through his solicitor, calling fresh evidence, much of it relating to documents sourced from Caltex service stations. Resolving that objection requires the Court to determine with some precision the nature of the documents sought to be tendered, and whether, bearing in mind the nature of the documents, they have any capacity to play a relevant part in the litigation of this appeal.

3The appellant, Raymond Younan was found guilty by Magistrate Maloney on the 2nd February 2011 of 24 counts of obtaining a benefit by deception. The deception in each case was identified by the learned Magistrate as the appellant's use of a Caltex card for his own purposes at the same Caltex service station on 24 discreet occasions, all the time knowing that he was not entitled to use the card for such a purpose. The benefit arising from the 24 transactions proved against the appellant amounted to $31,154. As best I can tell from reading His Honour's remarks leading to verdict, the then focus of the appellant's case centred upon claimed problems arising from identification of images on CCTV camera footage.

4Mr Provera, counsel appearing on the appeal, was also counsel appearing before the learned Magistrate in the Court below. The appeal, to the extent in has been advance thus far, appears to hinge on a far more esoteric point, not taken in the Court below. Leave has been given by Chief Judge Blanch to the prosecution to adduce further evidence, firstly as to the ownership of product being sold at Caltex Service Stations, and in particular at the relevant Caltex service station, where discounts provided by Woolworths are available. As events turned out, it would seem the prosecution had alleged, and the parties assumed in the Local Court that Caltex was the owner of all products sold at service stations bearing the Caltex label.

5Mr Freeman's, the National Loss Prevention Manager for Woolworths Limited Petrol Division, and harbinger of the opposed evidence. On the voir dire his evidence is that insofar as the provision of petrol to service centres where Caltex and Woolworths appear to have a relationship, Caltex refines the fuel products, Woolworths purchases the refined product from Caltex and is permitted to use the Caltex name at its petrol sites solely as a marketing ploy to let customers know they are buying a quality product. However, Mr Freeman deposed, Caltex do not own anything, including non-fuel items, within the Woolworth's petrol sites. 

6The Cross-examiner focused upon the ownership of the StarCard`, which I have assumed is the same as the ""Caltex"" card earlier referred to. Mr Freeman referred to it as ""a Caltex run credit card, so to speak."" When asked, "" Who owned the terminals for the StarCard system?"" Mr Freeman's response was that he had a ""feeling - an understanding, they're ours. Anything in that site was ours. We had to purchase that and the software."" He conceded he was not 100% sure but was 99% sure the terminals were Woolworths.

7Mr Freeman explained purchases paid for with the StarCard ran through both the shop's till and the StarCard terminal. Indeed it didn't go through the till completely until it had gone through the terminal to StarCard for approval first, ""So it's virtually one and the same.""

8However, it seems StarCard may have specifications limiting certain kinds of transactions. These specifications may relate to the limiting authorization for a specific type or any type of fuel purchased on the card; whether non-fuel products are or are not available to be purchased on the card; were two examples given. It would seem the scope of authorization permitted by the card, while being contained on the magnet strip of the card was not transferred to any Woolworth's kept record of the transaction. It would seem such information was retained only within the records of StarCard. But, as I understand his evidence, Woolworths kept within its computer data bases POS[point of sales] records of the use of the StarCard in relation to purchases made with it.

9Mr Freeman's evidence was these all came back, Australia-wide, through his office. He ran certain filters through every transaction that occurred at the Woolworth sites, Australia-wide, and it printed out exception reports daily, weekly, fortnightly, and monthly depending on what type of transactions he was looking at. 

10At the Crown's request he identified a number of documents which he described as ""point of sale information"". The documents he was shown he said were ones printed from a secure database from his office desk relating to certain transactions from a particular site. As to that secure database from his desk office, only three people had access to it - the National Operations Manager, the General Manager and himself. The parties appear to agree, this evidence means no more than, those three persons have access to the database when at this location. Freeman conceded as much when he said the only other persons he was aware of that could have access to the information contained in the data base were IT people.

11His evidence was the documents were automatically generated through Woolworths' Postec system, our point of sale system. He agreed he was responsible for the printout of the documents. His evidence was:

I had to print them - when they go onto the database I've actually got to what they call recall the information back, so it comes from the database, loads onto my computer and then I view them back and print them from that. They go into a data warehouse and I bring them back. 

12In the course of his work he accesses CCTV material from various sites. In some sites a newer system of accessing CCTV images has been installed, which permits him to view CCTV images from his desk top. The older system, which may has some relevance in this voir dire requires his attendance at the relevant service station site for viewing purposes. The CCTV footage, which the respondent seeks to tender, had to be accessed at the actual site to review the footage. He had attended that site (Bass Hill) on two occasions. 

13He conceded that he sometimes delegated reviewing footage at service station sites to ""our petrol specialists if they were capable of doing that procedure"" but 90% of the time he did it himself to maintain the integrity of the machine. He had made the copies of the CCTV images he had been shown before, which I understand were to be presented to the Court. 


14As I noted at the outset both the Postec system printouts and the CCTV material sought to be tendered by the Respondent are being tendered as documents as understood within the context of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act).


15The Dictionary to the Act defines document to mean any record of information and includes:

a) anything on which there is writing; or
b) anything on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for persons qualified to interpret them; or
c) anything from which sounds, images or writings can be reproduced with or without the aid of anything else;
d) a map, plan drawing or photograph.

16While the printout documents in question have not been tendered but have been marked MFI 1, it is safe to make a number of assumptions about them. If any of the assumptions are incorrect, and upon that basis likely to result in a flawed reasoning process the parties are at liberty to tender the documents for the purpose of exposing the error in assumption and its impact upon the reasoning process.

17The evidence, as I already noted discloses Mr Freeman personally retrieved documents that contained point of sale information. From the evidence and conduct of the voir dire proceedings I have assumed: 





The point of sale designated in the documents is the ""Bass Hill Caltex Service Station"" - or some combination of those words. 

The documents were printed from a secure database from his office desk by him or some person at his direction.

The documents are said on the Respondent's case to relate to alleged purchases of petrol by the Appellant that are said to relate to the convictions subject to appeal before me; that is to say the documents produced were subject to targeted searches from information supplied by the Respondent and/or police to the office of the National Loss Prevention Officer for Woolworths. 

On the Respondent's case the documents are said to have relevance to some or all of the discreet purchases that are the subject of appeal. 

The documents have been, or are purported to have been, retrieved from an electronically encoded database, housed in a computer system under the control and direction of Woolworths. 

The encoded material when retrieved appeared in printed form on a document in letters of the alphabet and numbers arranged in such a manner that words, abbreviations, symbols and figures were formed that could be read and understood by persons literate in English and with some level of numeracy. 

The encoded material from which the retrieved documents came, on the Respondent's case, was said to have been created initially at the point of sale on dates and times said to have been printed on the various documents. 

18 Let me stress again, these are assumptions I have made; they do not constitute findings. The DDP Solicitor representing the Respondent, Ms Blizard, sought to describe the documents to me. I declined to take evidence from the bar table, anticipating, incorrectly as it turns out, the documents ultimately would be tendered on the voir dire.

19I turn now to Mr Provera's submissions on behalf of the Appellant. Firstly, he seeks, in the light of the evidence before me, to revisit the decision of the Chief Judge to permit the prosecution to call Mr Freeman, in circumstances where it did not do so at the trial before the Local Court. I will return to that issue shortly.

20Mr Provera submits the documents are hearsay documents, by virtue of their being business records. He argues the Respondent is forced to rely upon s. 69 of the Act. That in turn, he argues brings into play ss.170 -173 of the Act. The argument is that only persons who fit the requirements imposed by s.171 can authenticate business documents. That is to say, in the circumstances of this case, only persons who at the relevant time or afterwards, had a position of responsibility in relation to making or keeping the document.

21Accepting, only for the purpose of dealing with this argument the documents sought to be tendered against the Appellant are in fact business records, those documents were made in Mr Freeman's office by him or at his direction. They were, in effect, made by his command to a computer to print out a designated selection of encoded material from the encoded database, into documentary form, with the intention of capturing information sought during the course of a police investigation or a requisition from the Respondent. Mr Freeman is capable of authenticating the documents. 


22Ms Blizard submitted each document did not constitute a business record, but rather should be regarded as ""real"" evidence. If this were so, then s.69 of the Act would not apply, because the document would not be hearsay in content. She relies upon the reasoning of Walton J, Vice President of the Industrial Relations Commission in Cambell v Hitchcock [2003] NSWIR Comm 148 (3 June 2003) at [153 -154].


153 Wright J concluded his reasoning on this aspect of the judgment by quoting a passage from the headnote in R v Wood (1982) 76 Cr App R 23 (CCA) which I consider entirely applicable to the instant proceedings:

Where a computer is used as a calculator and its programming and use are both covered by oral evidence, the print-out produced is not hearsay evidence. Computer print-out is not a statement made by a witness but should more properly be treated as a piece of real evidence, the actual proof and relevance of which depends upon the testimony of a witness.

154. The hearsay rule does not apply to the exhibits sought to be tendered in this trial, and as such the exception to the hearsay rule in s. 69 does not arise.

23Even if the hearsay rule does not apply to the content of the documents, s. 170 identifies proof of the contents of the document needs to be authenticated. Again the maker of the document can establish that authentication. On the Respondent's case as I understand it the maker of the document was Mr Freeman. 

24Mr Provera has raised in argument the possibility of human error in the creation of the encoded material generated when non-fuel purchases are made at the service counter. While many non-fuel purchases might have contained upon them a bar-code which responds to an electronic impulse, other non-fuel purchases may not have bar code, say pieces of fruit. Hidden J, in NSW Crime Commission v Rinh [2003] NSWSC 14 distinguished between authentication and accuracy. Of this distinction, Austin J in ASIC v Rich [2005] 149 said:


118 Hidden J's reasoning in Rinh, distinguishing between authenticity and accuracy, identifies part of a wider distinction, between matters of authenticity going to the adducing of evidence, and matters going to the credibility and weight of documentary evidence once it has been authenticated and judged admissible. Authentication is about showing that the document is what it is claimed to be, not about assessing, at the point of the adducing of the evidence, whether the document proves what the tendering party claims it proves. As I shall explain, some of the defendants' criticisms of the tendered documents, made under the rubric of authentication, are better seen, upon analysis, as going to credibility and weight.


25I should note I have not entered into the debate raised by the decisions in NAB v Rusu [1999] NSWSC 539, Rinh (ante); Campbell v Hitchcock (ante), ASIC v Rich (ante) and DPP v Koopelian (2012) NSWSC 309. I have been fortunate enough to be able to resolve the matter by confining myself to the submissions of each party. There has been no suggestion that Mr Freeman should place his intended evidence upon affidavit.

26As presently advised, and subject to determining adversely to him his application to revisit the Chief Judge's ruling, I am proposing to reject Mr Provera's arguments and permit proof of authenticity of the documents (MFI 1) to be given by Mr Freeman. 

The CCTV document

27In answer to a question by me, Mr Freeman indicated he was the person who made the CCTV copies (MFI 2) - assuming the relevant CCTV copies are ones shown to him. He had been out to the Bass Hill site on two occasions. He was asked in cross-examination whether he had any responsibility making the documents stored at the service station. He agreed he had not. He was asked whether he had any responsibility keeping these documents - he agreed he had not. Mr Provera's questions focus upon documents that play no physical part in these proceedings. 

28No attempt has been made to tender the documents stored at the service station. Those documents (CCTV images) are not before the court. There is no need to authenticate them. The documents (CCTV images) before the court are the copies made by Mr Freeman. It is those documents that must find authentication before they become admissible. I am satisfied on the evidence before me those latter documents can be authenticated as copies of the documents kept at the service station. 

29As presently advised, and subject to determining adversely to him his application to revisit the Chief Judge's ruling, I am proposing to reject Mr Provera's arguments and permit proof of authenticity of the CCTV documents (MFI 2) to be given by Mr Freeman. 


Mr Freeman's Evidence and the interests of justice

30Mr Provera's argument is that no application for adjournment was sought by the prosecution in the court below to permit them to obtain evidence from Mr Freeman - who apparently was unavailable at the time. Likewise no application was made to have Mr Freeman declared unavailable and read his statement. I have not reviewed in detail the Local Court transcript. I have reviewed His Honour's reasons for verdict. As I earlier noted the authenticity of the documents did not appear to be a feature of the case as it was presented in the Local Court. 


31An accused person is entitled to take every advantage open to him, even if it presents as a technical one. That this aspect was not ventilated in the Local Court does not bar the Appellant from raising it in his District Court appeal. But if it is to be raised the interest of justice require that the Respondent be permitted to address the issue with evidence that was apparently unnecessary to call at the Local Court. It then becomes a question for the tribunal rehearing the matter supplemented by fresh evidence, no doubt tested in the appeal proper, to determine whether the weight and reliability of the documents is impugned at all, or to such an extent that the verdicts entered in the Local Court can no longer survive. 


32For these reasons I am not prepared to revisit the decision of the Chief Judge, assuming, for the purposes of resolving Mr Provera's argument, I had jurisdiction to do so.

Formal Orders

33The Appellant's application to reject Mr Freeman's evidence in respect of documents constituting MFI 1 is rejected.

34The Appellant's application to reject Mr Freeman's evidence in respect of documents constituting MFI 2 is rejected.

2760188,R v Ngati [2012] NSWDC 258,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: On 31 July this year the trial of Johnny Ngati commenced. He pleaded not guilty to two counts on an indictment, the first alleging that he was guilty of an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal and the second alleged that he had failed to stop and driven dangerously while being pursued by police. 

2The Crown opened and evidence was called for a day and a half. After morning tea on the second day of the trial a change of attitude was foreshadowed. Mr Evers on the part of Mr Ngati suggested that his client would plead guilty to the non-aggravated form of count 1 and guilty to count 2. The Crown Prosecutor obtained approval to have the indictment amended by the insertion of an alternative count to count 1. Mr Ngati pleaded guilty to that as well as the driving offence and the Crown accepted those pleas of guilty in full satisfaction of the indictment. The jury was then discharged having had a day and a half of their time wasted. I say wasted because the Crown was never going to be able to prove count 1 in the way in which it was particularised on the indictment and the chances of Mr Ngati escaping conviction on the driving offence, given the evidence was mounting up against him, were very slim indeed. Thus it was entirely appropriate for the pleas of guilty to be entered in the circumstances I have outlined.

3What is disappointing, however, is that this was not done some time earlier. It is accepted by Mr Evers that these were very late pleas of guilty. It is accepted that he could have pleaded guilty to the non-aggravated form of the offence of break, enter and steal at any time. I will therefore reduce the sentence that I would otherwise impose on Mr Ngati by a relatively small amount. Nevertheless there will be a discount to reflect the utilitarian value, small though it was, of Mr Ngati's pleas.

4It is now my task to sentence Mr Ngati for the offences to which he has pleaded guilty. On 21 September 2011 in the early hours of the morning security camera footage at the Coles Illawong store recorded two men breaking into the premises and then using crowbars to open locked cabinets in which cigarettes were stored. One of the men was carrying a doona cover and both of them acted quickly placing large numbers of cigarettes, about $14,000 worth, into the doona cover before carrying it away. The two men were Daniel Sirol and Peter Ofo. They carried the stolen cigarettes to a Nissan Pintara motor vehicle driven by the offender.

5The alarm had been raised whilst the two men were still in the store and large numbers of police responded. One police officer who was driving towards the Coles supermarket saw the Nissan Pintara. It aroused his suspicions and so he motioned for the driver to stop. He used his flashing lights and his siren and he used hand gestures as well to indicate to the driver that he wanted the vehicle to be brought to a halt. Instead the offender drove off and what followed thereafter was a sixty-five minute pursuit in which the offender drove, at times, highly dangerously. At some stages he was driving at or even below the speed limit but at other times he drove at a grossly excessive speed, on one occasion 165 kilometres an hour. In the course of attempting to evade the police pursuit he drove through seven red traffic lights. A map was tendered in the course of the trial indicating the length of the journey that the offender undertook with the police in pursuit of him. He drove through many suburbs risking the lives and safety of many people as he did so.

6Eventually the offender drove his vehicle into a dead end street. The police following him realised that he was cornered. Once the offender too realised his mistake he tied to get away by ramming the vehicle he was driving into a police vehicle blocking his path. When that failed he reversed his car, ramming another police vehicle which had pulled up behind him. It was at that stage that the offenders were arrested. There were the two who had gone into the store and the offender who had performed the role unsuccessfully, it turns out as a getaway driver.

7Many people appearing for sentence in these courts have difficult upbringings. We have an extreme example in the case of Mr Ngati. As people grow up they model their behaviour on what they see. Many people are brought up with good role models and therefore find it relatively easy to perform as valuable members of society. Mr Ngati did not have that opportunity. As he grew up he was exposed to a lifestyle where committing crimes was commonplace, as was acting violently. His parents had a large number of children, fourteen in fact. Mr Ngati was brought up by his grandparents. His contact with his parents was quite limited but when it did occur it was hardly to Mr Ngati's benefit. For example, when he saw his father he would usually be physically abusive towards him - as Mr Ngati told a psychologist, his father would beat him up pretty badly.

8On top of that he had the example of behaviour carried out by his older siblings. They too modelled criminality and violence towards him throughout his young life. He came to believe that the way they behaved, committing regular crimes, was normal. When he saw them with money from one of their criminal enterprises he thought that was something to aspire to. A good example of the extent to which Mr Ngati was subject to bad role models through his siblings as he grew up is to be found in the circumstance that at present six of his siblings are currently in custody.

9Mr Ngati did not have the same chances in life that most others in the community had. His decision, (and he accepts that it was his decision to begin and continue to commit crimes) has to be looked at in that light. He has a criminal history, quite a significant one for someone only twenty years of age. He has spent time in juvenile detention. He was only able to remain free in the community for a few months before committing this offence. This is his first time in adult gaol. It is no doubt a salutary experience for him. 

10He has been able to complete Year 10 whilst in detention and has worked at times in the past but he has not had much stability in his life at any time. He was in a relationship and had children. He says that one of the factors that led to him going downhill leading up to the offences I have got to sentence him for was that DOCS took his daughter away from him. That, he says, was the commencement of a period where he began using heroin, a drug he says he was affected by when he committed these offences.

11He was on bail at the time he committed these offences, for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He has since been sentenced for that matter and is in fact currently serving that sentence. The non-parole period will expire on 29 October 2012. 

12I discussed with Mr Evers the appropriate starting date for the sentences I am to impose upon Mr Ngati. I have decided that will be 30 April this year, applying the principle of totality which requires that I look at the overall effective sentence for the two offences I must sentence Mr Ngati for and the offences he is currently serving a sentence for. The principle of totality is important of course and for that reason I will partially accumulate the sentences that I will impose upon Mr Ngati.

13Mr Ngati gave evidence. It is the sort of evidence I have heard many times before but not usually from someone as young as Mr Ngati. Often, offenders appear before me having spent a large proportion of their lives in custody and finally it seems they have realised the futility of the way they have lived their lives up until then. They finally recognise that by spending a life in custody simple pleasures which should be enjoyed by everyone are denied them. Mr Ngati gave evidence that he, even at the relatively youthful age of twenty, realises what he is missing by being in custody. Notwithstanding the bad role models he has had, he gave evidence that he understands he is missing out on many enjoyable parts of life through spending his time in custody.

14Moreover Mr Ngati gave evidence about what he needs to do to stay out of trouble. He appeared to me to be genuine in what he said. But of course things are not going to be easy for Mr Ngati. He has a substantial way to go. It is primarily for that reason that I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. Of course there are other reasons for special circumstances, in particular a mathematical one relating to the fact that these sentences will be accumulated on the sentence imposed in the Local Court.

15Although Mr Ngati is twenty now, he was only nineteen at the time of these offences. Although the law draws a bright line between offences committed when an offender is under eighteen and those committed when the offender is over eighteen, there is no bright line as far as maturity is concerned. Mr Ngati was very much a young man when he committed these offences. He did not have the maturity that an adult would have. That is very much a matter in his favour.

16I turn now to an issue I have not yet mentioned which concerns the issue of parity. Mr Cyril and Mr Offo were both sentenced by Judge Garling. The Crown appropriately provided me with Judge Garling's remarks on sentence and the criminal histories of both Mr Cyril and Mr Offo. Mr Cyril in fact had no criminal history. Mr Offo's criminal history was not quite as bad as that of Mr Ngati. It is important to note, when the sentence that I am about to impose upon Mr Ngati is compared with the sentences imposed on Mr Cyril and Mr Offo, that they both received a twenty-five per cent discount for pleading guilty, but that was for the aggravated form of the offence which carried with it a higher maximum penalty. I have fashioned a sentence in order to ensure that Mr Ngati does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentences I will impose upon him with the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders.

17It remains the case that these two offences were serious. As I mentioned during the course of describing the offender's manner of driving, significant numbers of people were put at risk. I make that finding simply because of the length over which the pursuit took place and the way in which the offender drove during the course of that pursuit. Large numbers of police were chasing him and the pursuit only came to an end after the offender trapped himself in a dead end street, but even after that he continued to drive dangerously ramming two police cars in attempt to get away. To say that his driving was seriously criminal is something of an understatement.

18The break enter and steal offence is also serious. He was part of a scheme which involved significant intrusion to the legitimate property rights of the supermarket in which cigarettes were taken. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the objective gravity of a crime must be reflected in the sentencing imposed. That fundamental rule is a significant constraint on the leniency that I can offer the offender. I sentence Mr Ngati as follows.

19For the offence of driving dangerously and not stopping during a police pursuit I set a fixed term of imprisonment of one year to date from 30 April 2012. For the offence of break enter and steal, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 30 December 2012. It will expire on 29 June 2014 that is the first day in which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set an eligibility for parole in that matter of two years. Thus the overall sentence consists of an effective non-parole period of two years and two months to date from 30 April 2012 an overall term of four years and two months. The offender is disqualified from driving for a period of twelve months from today.

2760197,Williams v Sutera [2012] NSWDC 163,"Judgment

1The defendants are the registered proprietors of land at 62 Allowrie Street, Jamberoo which, until 12 October 2004, was leased by a Mr John William Davis (""Mr Davis""). He ran an Ampol petrol station from these premises. In or about August 2004, Mr Williams, the plaintiff had discussions with Mr Davis about taking over the lease. This required the approval of the lessors, the defendants. After negotiations between Mr Davis and the plaintiff for the purchase were concluded, Mr Davis took the plaintiff to meet the defendants, whose approval of the transaction was required. 

2In the statement of claim filed on 15 April 2011, the plaintiff claims that in the course of conversation that the plaintiff had with the first defendant, Mr Sutera, it is alleged that Mr Sutera made representations as follows:

(a)The unleaded petrol tank designated to take ""Premium Unleaded Fuel"" and its fuel lines were 6 years old;

(b)That the diesel tank and its fuel lines were 6 years old;

(c)That all tank and fuel lines were in good working order to carry on the business of selling fuel.

3The plaintiff, in paragraph 14 of the statement of claim, asserts that, contrary to these warranties or representations, the fuel tanks were over 20 years old and in poor condition. Acting upon these representations, the plaintiff alleges that he entered into the tripartite lease agreement with Mr Davis and the defendants. As a result of entering into the business, he claims loss and damage, including loss of income, expenses, loss of goodwill, expenses in relation to legal proceedings commenced against him by customers for damages pursuant to the Sale of Goods Act, and damages generally pursuant to common law.

4The defendants, who deny making these representations, bring a cross-claim for damages for mesne profits, unpaid outgoings, repairs, cleaning, legal costs and other expenses. Judgment has been entered against the plaintiff/cross-defendant. The amounts claimed by the defendants/cross-claimants for these items changed before, during and after the hearing.

5The plaintiff's claim initially sought remedies under ss 68 and 72 Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). These claims were abandoned by the plaintiff on 23 May 2012, when the proceedings were listed for hearing. The cause of action pleaded is an action in deceit (Derry v Peek [1886-90] All ER Rep 1). 

Procedural history

6These proceedings have an unfortunate history of vacated hearing dates.

7The claim and cross-claim were first listed for hearing on 28 November 2011 in the Wollongong District Court running list. The proceedings were stood over for hearing in that list on Friday 2 December 2011. The matter was not ready to proceed by reason of non-compliance by the plaintiff with previous orders for service of reports. In addition, both parties needed to serve updating affidavits in relation to the claim and cross-claim. Orders were made to this effect by the List Judge, including an order that the plaintiff should provide particulars of the nature of the Anshun estoppel (Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589) which was alleged to apply to claims for outgoings in the cross-claim.

8When the matter was listed for hearing in the 12 March 2012 sittings, in which I was the List Judge, both parties asked for the hearing to be adjourned and to be specially fixed to commence on Monday 28 May 2012 due to outstanding issues in relation to subpoenae and discovery. Both sides considered the matter was not ready for hearing. On this occasion, as in November 2011, neither side sought a costs order by reason of the unreadiness of the other party.

9The matter was specially fixed for hearing for Monday 28 May 2012 as a three-day fixture. On 23 May 2012 Letherbarrow SC DCJ, noting that the parties were not ready to proceed until the week following, the date for this special fixture, in circumstances where the sittings had been reduced to exclude this week, directed the matter be listed as number one in the hearing list of the following sittings in September 2012. This adjournment was occasioned by no fault of the parties. At the time, no costs order in relation to the vacation of this hearing date was sought or made. 

10Letherbarrow SC DCJ noted that the plaintiff did not wish to proceed with his claim under the Fair Trading Act, and directed an amended statement of claim be filed and served within 7 days deleting that part of the action, with any amended defence to be filed and served 21 days thereafter. His Honour also noted that the plaintiff intended to bring an application to set aside default judgment on the cross-claim. 

11When the matter came before me for hearing on Monday 17 September 2012, the plaintiff had not filed an amended statement of claim, nor had any application been brought to set aside the default judgment. However, both parties were keen to proceed with the hearing after so many adjournments. The plaintiff once again formally abandoned both the Fair Trading Act claim and the entitlement to bring an application to set aside default judgment on the cross-claim, and the hearing proceeded on the pleadings as they were, although the plaintiff agreed he was no longer entitled to press the Fair Trading Act claim.

12I shall first deal with the plaintiff's claim for damages for deceit.

The plaintiff's claim

13The plaintiff did not give any evidence in his claim for damages, and relied solely upon affidavits of his partner, Ms Maryanne Lorae Bleakley (Ms Bleakley) and Mr Davis, the former lessee. Both these witnesses were cross-examined on their affidavits.

The evidence of Mr Davis and Ms Bleakley

14Mr Davis started his evidence by saying that ""it was a long time ago"" and that he had ""no reason to think that it would end up in a situation like this"" (T 3). 

15Mr Davis' evidence about the representations was as follows (at T 3-4):

""MARSHALL

Q. All right. Now, sir, you, I think you've told us, are a local in the Jamberoo area, and have been all your life?
A. Correct.

Q. And you were familiar, before you ran this business, with the petrol station site?
A. Correct.

Q. And you knew, for example, that no new tanks had been put in for many, many years?
A. Correct.

Q. And so, if anybody said to you, in your presence, that the fuel tanks at the service station were only about five years old, you would think, that's just not true, correct?
A. Could you repeat that, please?

Q. All right. If somebody said, in your presence, so while you're there, ""The fuel tanks at this service station are only about five years old,"" you, number one, would remember that, and number two, you'd think, ""That's not true"", correct?
A. There was talk of one tank being replaced.

Q. All right. At no time did Salvatore Sutera say, in your presence, that the tanks are only five years old, did he? He didn't say that?
A. Not to me, no.

Q. And not to anyone within your hearing?
A. There were conversations between Mr Williams and Mr Sutera that I wasn't present in.""

16Mr Davis then contradicted this evidence (at T 4):

""Q. So you had some discussions with Paul Williams before he purchased your business; that's correct, isn't it? Just, you spoke to him about the sale of your business and--
A. Correct.

Q. I think we call that negotiation; would you agree that's what you did?
A. Correct.

Q. And at no time during those negotiations did anybody say, within your hearing, to Paul Williams, that, ""The tanks are five years old and in good condition; you should be able to do quite well there""?
A. To the best of my recollection, there were words along those lines.

Q. But they were not said by Salvatore Sutera, were they?
A. Yes.""

17Mr Davis' affidavit (Exhibit A, paragraphs 23-25) makes no reference at all to these representations:

""23. Shortly after (I cannot recall the date) I met Paul ad Marianne his partner at the Service Station Premises and then we went to the private premises of the Defendants who were the landlords. I introduced Paul and Marianne to Salvatore and Dora Sutera (the Defendants) at their Jamberoo residence. We spoke about details such as the lease being transferred to Paul and other things such as the amount rent [sic], the term, Paul being transferred the first option to purchase the Defendants [sic] business similar to the option I had been given to me by the defendants' [sic], and how rent to [sic] be paid.

We had the following conversation:

I said to Salvatore ""I have first option to purchase under the lease, will that transfer to Paul?""

Mr Sutera said ""Yes""

I said ""will the purchase price will [sic] be roughly $320,000""

Mr Sutera said ""Yes, roughly""

Paul said ""Yes I would like to purchase it I have just obtained finance for other matters and I want around 12 months to settle down and make my mind up""

Mr Sutera said to Paul ""If you want, I can look at helping with the finance for the purchase.""

Paul said ""Not at this point, I would like to establish the business first and after 12 months I will get back to you.""

On the day in question all parties got along and there was no tension or arguments. At this meeting it was agreed by all threes [sic] parties that the lease would be transferred to Paul with the option to purchase and I would sell the business to Paul.

24. At the time I was being represented by Carter Fergerson [sic] Solicitors, Mr Tim Carter was my solicitor and I instructed him to issue contracts to Paul Williams who had agreed to purchase my business and transfer of lease [sic] to him. Everything proceeded without issue and the sale and transfer occurred.

25. After the point of the initial conversations with the defendants, Mr Paul Williams dealt with the defendants by himself.""

18Mr Davis agreed, looking at paragraph 23 of his affidavit, that he had not stated anything to this effect in his affidavit (at T 5):

""Q. Sir, in your affidavit, you've got some conversations you record in your affidavit. For example, paragraph 23. Just have a look at paragraph 23, and read it to yourself, and then I'll ask you a question. So, paragraph 23 is recording a conversation that you had and witnessed with Mr Sutera at his home, correct?
A. Correct.

Q. And this is the conversation that occurred at the home, and you've put nothing in there about tanks only being five years old, have you?
A. No.

Q. Well, the reason you didn't put it in this paragraph is because just wasn't said, isn't that right?
A. No.

Q. But you would have remembered something like that being said, if it had been said, and included it in your affidavit?
A. With all due respect, sir, I am not a legal person.""

19Mr Davis gave another version in which Mr Sutera stated that one tank, not all of them, had been replaced (at T 7-8):

""Q. Well, back in 2004, you knew that the tanks were not five years old, they were older than that; true?
A. Some of them were, yes.

Q. Some of them were a lot older than five years?
A. Some of them, yes.

Q. And so, if Mr Sutera had said, in your presence, ""The tanks are only five years old,"" you'd know that that just wasn't true.
A. It would not be fully true, no.

Q. And you'd want to correct that, wouldn't you? You'd want to say, ""That's not true"", wouldn't you?
A. From my resurrection (as said), I thought he was talking about the one that was replaced.

Q. You knew that there was more than one tank under the ground at the service station, didn't you?
A. Yes.

Q. And when, according to you, it's said that the tanks are only five years old, you'd know that's not true.
A. I beg your pardon, sir; I have said in this Court a number of times, there was one that was supposed to be renewed. That is not all of them.

Q. Renewed?
A. Or replaced, whatever you want to call it.

Q. So you knew back in 2004 there was one tank that had to be renewed, is that what you're saying?
A. That it had been renewed.

...

Q. Are you saying that what Mr Sutera said was in fact accurate?
A. Yes and no, because there was a diesel tank, an unleaded tank, a premium tank - these are fuels - and there was also a spare tank that wasn't used, that hadn't been used for a long period of time.

Q. And how old were these tanks?
A. Some of them would have been probably original, but there was one that was supposed to be replaced.

Q. Which one?
A. From what I recall, I believe it was the unleaded one, but I can stand corrected on that.

Q. Yes, but when Mr Sutera said this, were you - was what he said to Mr Williams accurate?
A. To a degree.

Q. To what degree?
A. That one of them would have been replaced in a few years beforehand, and I can't say how many years that was. I'm under oath and I'm telling the truth. It mightn't be - I mightn't be answering them the way you want, but I'm telling the truth.

Q. Look, I'm very happy with your answers, because what you're saying is what you recall. What you're saying is that nothing that Mr Sutera said was untruthful or misleading, is that right? He didn't say anything that made you say, ""Hang on, that's not right""? Is that your evidence?
A. I believe Mr Sutera was talking about the one tank, not all the tanks.""

20Ms Bleakley's cross-examination, in its entirety, was as follows (at T 12):

""Q. Madam, in paragraph 7, can you just read paragraph 7 again to yourself and let me know when you've finished?
A. Yes, I've finished.

Q. Now, the conversation, where was that conversation? Where did it take place?
A. That conversation was at the Suteras' [sic] home in Jamberoo.

Q. And you've referred there to something being five years old. And you've got a reference there to petrol tanks, you see that?
A. Yeah, about the petrol tanks, yes.

Q. Was it a petrol tank or petrol tanks, or are you not sure?
A. I really wasn't sure. I think it was--""

The evidence of Mrs Sutera

21Mrs Sutera, the second defendant, said that she and her husband had purchased the petrol station in 1976 and ran it themselves until 1999, when a Mr Pickham was put in as the lessee. He left the premises in a state of disorder and rectification work was necessary before Mr Davis, the next lessee, took over running the petrol station.

22Mrs Sutera was adamant that no statement had been made to the plaintiff that any of the tanks were five years old:

""Q. And the fact was that there were no tanks that were five years old, is that right?
A. We never say the tank was five year [sic] old.

Q. Well, you heard Mr Davis and you heard Mrs Bleakley say that there was a conversation in your home, that your husband, Mr Sutera, had said the tanks are no more than five years old. Whether he was referring to one tank, or more tanks--
A. Absolutely not."" (T 24-25)

23She went on to explain (at T 26):

""Q. Because the only tank that was replaced, was replaced in 1983, is that correct?
A. It was not replaced. There was we get one extra one.

Q. All right, there was an extra one. So there were no tanks less than five years old at the service station when Mr Williams is moving in?
A. There was no tank under five year old [sic].""

24Mr Sutera was not called. The statement of claim refers in various places to negotiations between ""the defendant"" (paragraph 5), ""the defendants"" (paragraph 10-13) and ""the first defendant"" (paragraph 12(c)(i)). The statement of claim paints a confusing picture of ""the defendants"" having made representations (paragraph 12), either by themselves ""or by their servant or agent"" (a person whose identity is unknown) or by ""the first defendant"" (paragraph 12(c)(i)). Breach of duty is pleaded in relation to the first defendant in paragraph 16.

25Although an attempt was made to put to Mrs Sutera that she was not present during part of the negotiations, I am satisfied from her description of events that she was present throughout. I also note that the written outline for the plaintiff (paragraphs 2.1(j)- (m)) refers to these representations made by the defendants ""or by their servant or agent"" (paragraph 2.1(j)). The ""servant or agent"" is unnamed. It was never put to Mr Davis that he made any such representation; there is nothing in his affidavit to this effect.

26There is clearly ill-will of long standing between the parties. Mr Sutera was in court and, at the request of the solicitor for the plaintiff/cross-defendant, was asked to leave after complaints about his behaviour. In her evidence and cross-examination, Mrs Sutera was at times upset and angry. However, I am satisfied that she nevertheless gave truthful evidence. The real problem seems to be, to borrow the description used by White J in ET Petroleum Holdings Pty Ltd v Clarenden Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 435 at [132], that there has been ""unreasonable and provocative conduct"" on both sides for some years. An angry witness is not necessarily an untruthful witness. I am satisfied by Mrs Sutera's description of events that the representations alleged by the plaintiff were never made.

27This constitutes the totality of the evidence about this representation, as the plaintiff has not provided an affidavit or given evidence. I note references to ""five years old"" throughout the cross-examination differ from the alleged representation in the pleadings, which were that the tanks were six years old. Nor were there representations of the kind referred to in paragraph 2(c).

The nature of the plaintiff's claim for deceit

28Counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiff needed to establish the following issues:

(a)The representations were made;

(b)The representations were misleading in the sense of being untrue, or alternatively reckless (Wood v Balfour [2011] NSWCA 382); and,

(c)There was reliance upon the representations.

29It should first be noted that the plaintiff puts his case on the basis that there were misleading statements made, and not upon omissions: Wood v Balfour [2011] NSWCA 382.

30The principles derived from Derry v Peek, supra, have been approved in a number of decisions over the past century, commencing with Civil Service Co-Operative Society of Vic Ltd v Blyth (1914) 17 CLR 601 at 609 and most recently by the Court of Appeal in Wood v Balfour, supra. Actionable statements may include those where a representor lacked belief in the truth of the representation, or made it recklessly, without caring whether it was true or false. Halsbury's Laws of Australia at [110-5140] states that:

""Although actual dishonesty and recklessness may merge into lack of belief in the truth of a statement, so that nowadays the test may be stated as a unitary one, namely whether the maker honestly believed that the representation was true, moral culpability is to this extent vital in fraud, and mere carelessness is not enough. At best, lack of reasonable grounds for a belief is merely an aid in determining whether the belief is genuinely held."" 

31The defence consists essentially of a denial of the warranty or representation as pleaded and of the loss and damage claimed. I should, however, note that a defence of s 14(1)(b) Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) has been pleaded. In the course of oral submissions, counsel for the defendant/cross-claimant conceded that s 14 would operate from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff and did not press this argument.

What was said?

32In Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319, McLelland CJ in Eq stated:

""Where, in civil proceedings, a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive (which I will compendiously described as ""misleading"") within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act), it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court: (1) what the alleged conduct was; and (2) circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading. Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances. In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition. Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is a matter of ordinary human experience.

Each element of the cause of action must be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the court, which means that the court ""must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence"". Such satisfaction is ""not ... attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved"" including the ""seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding"": Helton v Allen (1940) 63 CLR 691 at 712.

Considerations of the above kinds can pose serious difficulties of proof for a party relying upon spoken words as the foundation of a causes of action based on s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act), in the absence of some reliable contemporaneous record or other satisfactory corroboration.""

33In Ingot Capital Investments & Ors v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets (No 6) [2007] NSWSC 124, McDougall J (under the heading ""Attention to detail is required"") set out McLelland CJ in Eq's statement of what must be proved where representations had been made orally, noting that it is necessary to prove ""with some precision"" (at [353]) the words used.

34Mrs Sutera said that the purpose of the meeting she and her husband had with the plaintiff was to obtain ""just tenant information"" (T 3). She explained: 

""HER HONOUR

Q. Sorry, just tenant information?
A. Just, you know, because we did a transfer of the lease, we just want to meet him, you know, and know what type of person, introduction, or whatever you call it.

Q. Just want to meet him?
A. Just want to meet him, yes."" (T 3)

35Mr Davis and the plaintiff had already concluded their negotiations, which appear to have taken place at the petrol station, or at least in circumstances where the plaintiff was able to see the facilities. He made no such representation, and I am satisfied the defendants did not do so either. The plaintiff has elected not to give evidence, and I draw a Jones v Dunkel inference (Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298).

Conclusion - No representation was made

36I am satisfied, from the extremely limited evidence set out above, that no representation was made that any tank was five (or six) years old or otherwise as to their quality. The ""new"" tank referred to by Mr Davis and Mrs Sutera turned out to be an additional tank installed on the property in 1983. Any reference to this tank being new would need to be interpreted contextually, not in isolation, in circumstances where the plaintiff had the opportunity to inspect the premises and discuss these matters with Mr Davis (Mercland Investment Group Pty Ltd v Duncalm Pty Ltd [2012] FCA 183 (""Mercland"")). 

Were the representations misrepresentations?

37In the event that I have erred in finding the representations were not made, I now consider whether, if made, they were misrepresentations.

38In Mercland, Edmonds J listed at [108] relevant circumstances comprising the context for the objective determination as to whether a non-disclosure was misleading or deceptive. Although that was an exercise carried out for the purpose of determining a claim under the Trade Practices Act and Fair Trading Act, and related to a non-disclosure that was admitted, the same procedure is of assistance here, particularly in view of the similarity of the asserted representation.

39Factors taken into account by Edmonds J included the fact that the state of the faulty bitumen was ""manifest and obvious on careful inspection"" (at [117]). In the present case, not only did the plaintiff have the opportunity to inspect the premises for himself, but to discuss the day-to-day workings with Mr Davis, with whom negotiations had been carried out. The plaintiff met the defendants in circumstances where, at least according to Mr Davis, the decision to lease the property had already been made. Any implied meaning arising out of the reference to a tank being ""five years old"" would, if it had been said, be a descriptive statement of age, rather than a warranty of quality. Anything that is five years old can be defective, just as an item which is second hand or has been in operation for many years can be in perfect working order. 

40Mr Davis' evidence was that there were problem with water in the tank while he was the lessee. These claims were, however, very generally put and, like the rest of Mr Davis' evidence, suffer from being recalled so long after the events that the precise date when he noticed water in the tank is uncertain. This evidence is of little or no value, and does not excuse the plaintiff from making his own inquiries.

41The plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter dated 7 March 2006 (Exhibit L) referring to problems of water in the tank commencing in 2005. The plaintiff instructed ""Tanknology"" to prepare a report and that although a report was prepared on 13 September 2006, it was not until January or February 2007, when the offending tank or tanks were removed from the ground, that it could be determined that the tank or tanks were not of the age which had been represented by the plaintiff (written submissions, paragraph 3.9).

42In written submissions, the plaintiff claims he was not on notice until January or February 2007 as to the cause of the problem, and this was the first time he became aware of ""the potential connection"" (written submissions, paragraph 3.12) between the representation when in fact the tanks were older than had been described.

43I am satisfied that if such representations had been made, there was no reliance upon them. The plaintiff had already decided to lease the premises, based on his own inspection and information from Mr Davis.

44This brings me to the question of whether there was in fact any loss.

Was there any loss?

45Although I have found that the representations were not made, were not misrepresentations or fraudulent, and were not relied upon by the plaintiff, I also set out my findings as to whether the plaintiff can establish loss flowing from the representations. 

46The plaintiff's written submissions provide me with only one sentence in this regard, namely a statement that I should make orders as to damages ""set out in the affidavit of Mr Brett Goodyer"" (page 12 of the plaintiff's written submissions). Mr Autore did not elaborate on these submissions in the course of his address to me. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Mr Goodyer's report did not refer to or contain any of the plaintiff's financial records, and was based on untendered material, anecdotal information and speculation.

47The first problem is that Mr Goodyer's report does not include information about some of the damages claimed, such as an assessment of potential economic loss suffered by the business as a result of damage to customer vehicles that the business had either repaired or paid to have repaired. The report does, however, assert that the business suffered the following potential economic loss:

49These documents were prepared on the basis of third party records of Kel Campbell Pty Ltd and Caltex Australia Limited, provided by the plaintiff for the purpose of this report. Mr Goodyer notes other losses, including the complete loss of the business after the plaintiff walked out of the business on or about 8 September 2011, although this appears to have been regarded by him as a loss of goodwill (for which he accepted the plaintiff's estimate of $20,000). 

50Mr Goodyer states that an interview with the accountant for the business, Ms Leanne Mitchell, as well as a review of the financial statements of the business, indicated that ""the financial statements of the business of the business were not sufficient to determine the potential economic loss suffered by the business in relation to the reduction in fuel sales, mechanical sales or the business goodwill"" (paragraph 6.1 of Mr Goodyer's report).

51Mr Goodyer went on to note that there were no financial records of ""sufficient quality"" (paragraph 6.1) to enable him to perform quantification of economic loss in relation to the mechanical services portion of the business. Essentially, all he had to go on were the third party records of fuel sales and purchases during the period of review.

52This means that the calculation of economic loss was carried out without any regard to the tax returns, profit and loss accounts or other financial records of the plaintiff. Similarly, the estimate of ""goodwill"" for the business of $20,000 (paragraph 6.23) was based upon the plaintiff's statement to this effect. The third party records of Kel Campbell Pty Ltd are not before the court.

53Mr Goodyer's report suffers from the following defects:

(a)He has accepted, without question, information he calls ""anecdotal evidence"", which he says proves substantial loss resulted from a reduced mechanical services revenue, in circumstances where I have no information as to what that loss was, or why it resulted from problems with the tanks, let alone problems with the tanks being more than five or six years old. Anecdotal evidence is no substitute for business records: Re Samir Baini and Commissioner of Taxation [2012] AATA 440 at [161];

(b)It is reliant upon documentation which has not been tendered or made available to the court (Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 (""Makita"") at [85]);

(c)Essential financial records such as the plaintiff's tax returns and profit and loss accounts have not been made available;

(d)As Mr Goodyer acknowledges, what financial records of the business exist are not sufficient to determine the potential economic loss suffered by the business in relation to the reduction of fuel sales, mechanical sales or the business' goodwill (at paragraph 6.1);

(e)Most of the information provided to Mr Goodyer was provided informally by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has elected not to give evidence in this case and this information cannot be tested (Makita at [85]). This is just as much a problem in relation to quantum as it is in relation to liability; and,

(f)Mr Goodyer fails to expose his reasoning process in order to justify opinions expressed on many issues, such as the value of the goodwill (Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) v Rich (2005) 218 ALR 764 at [135]-[136]).

54The manner in which damages for deceit should be assessed has been helpfully summarised by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Auyeung v Chan [1999] NSWCA 417 (""Auyeung""). There should be evidence in relation to causation (Auyeung at [32]-[33]) as well as a careful analysis of financial records demonstrating the loss, unless there are compelling reasons for the unavailability of those documents. I am satisfied that no such evidence has been led here. The evidence of damage to the petrol tanks has no relevance to the age of those tanks.

55In Auyeung, the plaintiff had difficulty establishing precise costs of establishment expenses following the loss of records in a fire and her exclusion from the premises. No such explanation is volunteered here. The defendants' counsel drew my attention to the plaintiff's failure to provide documents on subpoena, which included financial records.

56I have set out in more detail, in relation to the cross-claim, the difficulties a trial judge faces where parties simply tender documents and leave it to the court to analyse them (Chouman v Margules (1993) 17 MVR 144). The onus lies on the plaintiff to establish both causation and the quantum of any loss claimed. The failure of the plaintiff to give evidence and be cross-examined, or to produce adequate financial records in order to establish his loss, or to make good his claim, for example that he was unable to sell diesel fuel for a lengthy period solely as a result of the tanks, means that I must find that the plaintiff has not established any loss arising as a result of the conduct of the defendants.

57The plaintiff accordingly fails in relation to all aspects of his claim for deceit. This brings me to a consideration of the cross-claim, which proceeds by way of assessment only, by reason of judgment having been entered in favour of the cross-claimants/defendants.

The cross-claim

58During the hearing, a schedule of damages served by the cross-claimants was tendered and marked Exhibit 1. There were calculation errors in this document. A revised schedule of damages was marked as MFI 3, with handwritten amendments. 

59Although the contents of the Exhibit 1 and MFI 3 were not challenged by the cross-defendant at the time, it was plain from the face of the document that it contained addition and other errors as follows:

(a)Wrong calculations such as the total figure for item 2 (reduced from $4,865.30 to $4080.26), item 3 (reduced from $21,538 to $15,026.60), repairs (increased from $702.08 to $709.53) and Bunnings costs (reduced from $635.79 to $516.35). 

(b)Inclusion of figures which should not have been there, such as the sum of $4,135 added to both the environmental report and soil removal sections. 

(c)An additional $3,034.35 for matters recently identified. This was added in a handwritten note and was not part of the Scott Schedule when the cross defendant's expert examined the issues raised in the Scott Schedule.

60The hearing progressed on the basis of MFI 3 as amended during the hearing. Mrs Sutera was cross-examined about many of these claims.

61However, after the evidence and submissions were concluded, a document described as ""version 2"" of the schedule of damages was provided, without leave, as an annexure to further written submissions. This document contained:

(a)A statement that legal costs totalling $10,796 were no longer included in the schedule;

(b)An addition to the amount claimed in item 2 resulting in a new total of $4,865.30 in lieu of $4,080.26; and

(c)A significant increase in the sum sought in item 3, namely $20,346.80 in lieu of $9,846.80.

62I have set out below the three different versions of the cross-claimant's schedule of damages.

TOTAL


$79,929.43

64As a result of inclusions and omissions, the sums claimed have varied from $48,297.56 to $79,929.43, the sum claimed in version 2 (provided after the hearing).

65The solicitor for the plaintiff/cross-defendant has not played an active role in endeavoring to ascertain what the correct sum for the quantum is. Although I imposed a timetable for further written submissions in relation to the proposed amendments, the plaintiff did not provide submissions on quantum (except legal costs), and it was necessary to relist the matter for directions on 26 September 2012.

66The parties' submissions on legal costs were in error. When preparing my judgment, it became apparent that the parties had overlooked clause 18(5)(d) concerning legal costs. In addition, the cross claimants had not answered the cross defendant's argument concerning liability to replace the tank (arguably an underground fixture), where the expert evidence was that the tank had failed due to reaching the end of its life rather than because of lack of care or misuse by the cross defendant (clause 18(4)(e)).

Oversights of fact in the conduct of proceedings

67The adversary system used in common law proceedings places the obligation of investigation and presentation of proceedings on the parties, in contrast to ""inquisitorial"" (Sharp v Rangott (2008) 246 ALR 84 at [3]) systems of enquiry by the judge used in civil code systems. If there is an error or oversight in the evidence, such as the mathematical errors in calculation of damages, the judge hearing the application is in a difficult position.

68In Chouman v Margules, supra, neither the parties nor the trial judge noticed that a police report tendered in the hearing referred to an 18 metre skid mark. This skid mark cast doubt on the defendant's claim of brake failure. The Court of Appeal held (by majority) that the oversight by counsel and the judge justified a new trial. Kirby J at 150 stated:

""Having admitted the report into evidence, it was then essential that Garling ADCJ should deal with it in disposing of the case before him. 

Of course, his Honour would ordinarily be entitled to rely upon the parties to direct his attention to matters of relevance in the case and to present, by questions and argument, the issues which arose from it. As it happens, they did not. His Honour did not himself advert to the entry, doubtless for this reason. If the entry were of minimal importance, or equivocal or unlikely to affect the result, this court would not interfere. It would uphold the trial judge's conclusion. It would do so out of deference to the advantages which he enjoyed in conducting the trial; the principle of finality of litigation; and the further principle which binds parties to the way in which their cases are conducted by their legal representatives: cf Devries v Australian National Railways Commission (1993) 67 ALJR 528 at 531; 112 ALR 641 (HC). 

However, in this case I have come to the view that there is a real risk that an injustice has occurred. The appellant was entitled to have the respondent's defence of brake failure properly and thoroughly scrutinised. She, at least, was completely innocent of any fault being a passenger in her son's vehicle and being undoubtedly injured in the impact which occurred. In the circumstances of a collision from behind she had a strong prima facie entitlement to recover damages by reason of negligence on the part of the respondent. His defence of brake failure should therefore have been scrutinised against the one crucial element in the police report which seems to have been overlooked by everybody, namely the record of the 18-metre skid. As that defence was not scrutinised by reference to this evidence and as the evidence was not adverted to at all by Garling ADCJ, it is my opinion that the trial before his Honour miscarried. An error has been shown which requires correction. It is not an error that can be corrected in this court. It requires a retrial so that the appellant may test both the respondent and the police constable by reference to the entry referring to the 18-metre skid which was entirely overlooked during the first trial, including by the trial judge."" [Emphasis added].

69Similarly, in Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council [2007] NSWCA 5 an appeal was allowed on the basis that the trial judge failed to consider relevant evidence. There was no suggestion that submissions had been made on this evidence, but ignored by the trial judge; the failure to address this evidence was a failure by counsel to do so, but the trial judge was criticised for not raising the issues of fact with counsel, or in his judgment, that the Court considered should have been raised.

70The problem of what a judge should do when relevant evidence has not been referred to in the is not one capable of easy resolution. Appellate courts have noted that the focus of common law courts in ascertaining the truth is increasing (Jones v National Coal Board [1957] QB 55 at 63; Sharp v Rangott at [3]; Bassett v Host [1982] 1 NSWLR 206 at 243). However, in Sharp the Full Court stated at [47] that ""a strictly adjudicative role, and absence of inquisitorial power, distinguishes the common law judge from his or her civil counterparts"" in relation to the calling of witnesses and the presentation of evidence. This applies to criminal proceedings as well: R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 576, although oversight in criminal proceedings may, unlike civil proceedings, constitute grounds for a new trial: Teoh v Hunters Hill Council (No 4) [2011] NSWCA 324 at [23] (but cf LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah (New South Wales Court of appeal, Tobias and Young JJA, 4 March 2011, unreported)).

71As these decisions do not set out what a judge should do when parties, for tactical reasons or due to oversight, make fundamental errors such as making, or not noticing, mistakes in the quantum of damages or overlooking a clause in a lease, I initially sought further written submissions. The submissions I received did not resolve the mathematical errors, or the failure to have regard to provisions in the lease. I therefore relisted the matter to invite further submissions, in the manner adopted by the first instance judge in Ford v Nagle [2004] NSWCA 33. There are still some minor mathematical discrepancies (see comments in version 2 of the cross-claimants' schedule of damages above), but I propose to disregard these.

72On 27 September I received further submissions from the cross claimant's solicitor, which can be summarised as follows:


The correct total of 3(a) - (ff) is $39,586.38 and not $59,933.18; it is agreed the sum earlier given is incorrect. 
Items 3(c) and (d) are agreed to be inconsistent with the affidavit of Mrs Sutera and should have been $21,538. 
Reconciliation of the payments for Rossi & Sons show that the sum in (d) is correct but the sum in (c) should be amended to $17,000.80 (being $19,846.80 less item (d) ($2,846). 
This means that the total claimed for (a) - (ff) is $36,240.38 (being $39,386.38 less $3,346). 
Consequently, the ""All items total"" in the document described as version 2 of the Schedule is also amended to $56,236.83. 

73Having noted the history of the changes to the sums claimed, I shall deal with each item in turn.

Item 1 - Mesne profits $11,876.60

74This claim is admitted.

Item 2 - Claim for unpaid outgoings

75These water rates, council rates and land tax payments relate (other than for an amount of $350 for 2007 rates) to outgoings payable under clause 11 of the Lease and item 6 in the reference schedule.

76The cross defendant claimed he was not obliged to pay any of these sums on principles derived from Anshun, supra. This claim is misconceived. First of all, the estoppel claimed arises out of a settlement between the parties of a claim by the cross claimants against the cross defendant. This is not Anshun estoppel, but accord and satisfaction: see the discussion of the relevant principles in National Australia Bank v Pollak [2001] FCA 1408. More importantly, the settlement related to land tax payments only, and for periods prior to the land tax and other outgoings sought by the cross claimants in this action. As the cross defendant conceded, in the course of the hearing, there was no overlap of any kind.

77The cross defendant did not challenge the quantum of these items, and he is liable to pay all these amounts. 

Items 3(a) - 3(h) in version 2

78The costs claimed here are the costs of Executive Electrical & Petroleum Services Pty Ltd replacing the suction line ($1,665.00), the Council application fee for replacing the diesel tank ($668.00), the replacement of the diesel tank ($23,193.60), the environmental report ($1,100), the costs of soil removal ($4,145.35). These costs are the subject of the adjustments set out in paragraph 72 above.

79Mr Connor's report (page 3 of Exhibit B) sets out the following general statements concerning the $1,665.00 claim for replacing the suction line by Executive Electrical & Petroleum Services Pty Ltd:

""The diesel tank allowed the influx of water contaminated to the storage vessel.

Diesel tank was identified as being defective on or before 4 April 2006 as confirmed by the Electrical & Petroleum Services Pty Ltd invoice dated 4 April 2006 (annexure ""J-1"") which reads at second sentence under contained Scope of Works states ""Note the suction line has been previously pressure tested and found to be faculty"".

Subsequent pressure tests obtained by the cross-defendant from Tanknology Pty Ltd dated 12 September 2006 (annexure ""J-2"") reads that a pressure test carried out by Mr Steve Hamer failed as leaks detected to the vessel exceeded EPA required criteria. The author states ""Tank failed due to a water ingress over the course of the test period"".

Subsequent excavation of the diesel tank identified at least four (4) holes to the vessel, ie. not fit for purpose (see photographs ""J-3"", ""J-4"", ""J-5"", ""J-6"", ""J-7"" and ""J-8"").

The vessel had reached the extent of its service life and had corroded to such extent that the vessel had to be replaced.

Specifically, based on these established facts, no breach of Clause 18(4)(e) has been demonstrated.""

80These comments would also relate to the Kiama Council application fee of $668 (item 3(b)).

81Mr Connor has the following to say about the costs of T.V. Rossi & Sons Pty Ltd (items 3(c) and 3(d)):

""Documents are from the installation contractor who excavated, removed, supplied replacement vessel and installed replacement vessel.

Specifically, based on these established facts, no breach of Clause 18(4)(e) has been demonstrated.

In addition, the claimed quantum is not established by the documents served with the claim.

Document ""59"" Tax invoice and receipt rendered by T.V. Rossi & Sons Pty Ltd asserts that only $19846-80 was claimed upon Mr Sam Sutera on 4 February 2007 for works associated with the replacement of the defective diesel storage tank.""

82The earth removal costs are agreed to relate to the fact that the stockpile material was left on site.

83Clause 18(4)(e) of the lease provides:

""LESSEE TO REPAIR LEASED PREMISES

18. (4) In addition to the lessee's obligations under paras 18(2) and 18(3) the lessee shall throughout the term of this lease and notwithstanding any other clauses in this lease (which do not apply to the matters listed in this para 18(4), carry out the following repairs and maintenance:

(e) repair any damage or breakage to the property, to the lessor's fixtures and property in the property, and to services and facilities in the property, caused by lack of care or misuse by the lessee or by its employees or agents.""

84The obligation of the lessee to carry out repairs to underground tanks and pipes for pumping petrol is helpfully set out in a decision of Austin J in RA & K Becker Pty Ltd v Cariste Pty Ltd (2001) 11 BPR 20,111. The facts in that case were similar to the present, namely that underground tanks and pipes installed before the plaintiff entered into possession developed a water problem after the plaintiff entered into the lease, and the question of responsibility for the maintenance of underground tanks, pipes and equipment needed to be construed in accordance with the lease. As was also the case here, there were rust holes in the pipes, water was entering into the petrol tank, and repairs needed to be carried out. The plaintiff commenced proceedings, seeking a declaration that the defendant was obliged to repair fuel tanks and pipes which supplied petrol.

85The relevant clauses of the lease in those proceedings, like the clauses in these proceedings, did not clearly and unambiguously allocate responsibility for the tanks, as both parties note in their further written submissions.

86Austin J noted (at [15]-[17]) that his task was as follows:

""[15] It is obvious from reading these provisions that nothing in the lease clearly and unambiguously allocates responsibility for maintenance of the tanks and pipes to one party or the other. The plaintiff says that when it commenced occupation the tanks and pipes were in place under the shopping centre and were not a part of the demised premises. It was understood between the parties, according to the plaintiff, that the plaintiff would be able to use the tanks and pipes which were connected to the petrol bowsers. On the plaintiff's view, these arrangements implied that the defendant would be responsible for the tanks and pipes. As its solicitor pointed out in correspondence, 'it would seem absurd for an incoming lessee to be responsible for the state of underground pipes for which it cannot obtain access without removing the concrete laid on top of the said premises'.

[16] On the other hand, the defendant maintains that Item 13 of the Schedule (the Equipment) was specifically stated to be 'not applicable', and the plaintiff was informed by the defendant's solicitors before the lease was entered into that no equipment would be provided. This made it clear, according to the defendant, that it was to have no responsibility for the tanks and pipes. In correspondence Mr Roach said:

'This is an independent service station and has the ability to do deals with suppliers regarding the dispensing of products, including but not limited to tanks, bowsers, pipes, pumps, waste etc, all of which can change at the whim of the operator.'

In his affidavit he said:

'The tank system is removable and can be changed in service stations depending on sales volumes of fuels. For example, if demand for a particular brand of fuel increases, a larger capacity tank can be supplied and installed. The recent trend away from leaded fuels is a further example of the necessity to replace or add new tank systems.'

[17] In my opinion, both the plaintiff and the defendant have made some valid commercial points, which could have been used in negotiations had the issue of responsibility for the tanks and pipes been specifically raised. But as far as the evidence goes, it appears that the issue was never raised prior to the execution of the current lease. All I can do, therefore, is to construe the words of the lease in order to decide whether they cover the issue.""

87Austin J's findings were set out at [28]-[31] as follows:

""[28] In my view, the key provision is cl26.15. Cl26 is headed 'Equipment'. It is literally unclear whether the heading is intended to refer to equipment generally, or to 'the Equipment'(the defined term). The heading begins with a capital 'E', suggesting the defined term, but that may be explained by the fact that every heading commences with a capital letter, and the definite article 'the' is missing from the heading. If the correct heading were 'the Equipment', it would be arguable that cl26 has nothing to say about the problem in this case, since the tanks and pipes do not fall within the definition of 'the Equipment'. But the sub-clauses of cl26 are not limited to the subject matter of 'the Equipment', as they deal with specific obligations relating to matters such as records of sales, dips of tanks, reporting the presence of water in tanks, meter readings on pumps, maintenance of stop switches and fire extinguishers and fuses, the cleaning of sumps and drains, and generally the maintenance of plant and equipment. Given the range of subject matter, it seems to me that the heading of cl26 is intended to refer to equipment generally rather than to 'the Equipment'.

[29] Cl26.15 obliges the Lessee to supply, install, repair, maintain and replace all plant and equipment necessary for the conduct of the Premises as a service station. There can be no doubt that if the tanks and pipes fall within the meaning of the words 'plant and equipment', they are plant and equipment necessary for the conduct of the Premises as a service station.

[30] In my opinion, the tanks and pipes are 'equipment', as that word is used in cl26. In support of that conclusion, I rely on my construction of the heading of cl26. Additionally, in a clause that deals with equipment of various kinds, provisions are found dealing with tanks and lines. Further, cl26.3 implies that the tank system can be part of the Equipment, and therefore can be characterised as equipment, and cl26.13 speaks of 'tanks and dispensing equipment', suggesting that tanks are a kind of equipment.

[31] At the time of execution of the lease, the tanks and pipes had been installed and had been used by the plaintiff for some years. In those circumstances the plaintiff contended that the 'plant and equipment' to which cl26.15 refers does not include the tanks and pipes that had been installed so much earlier. In my view, however, cl26.15 applies, in its terms, to equipment already installed at the time of commencement of the lease, as well as to equipment subsequently installed. In the former case, it imposes an obligation to repair and maintain the equipment. In so doing, it literally covers the problem raised by this case.""

88In the present case, the cross claimants relied, during the hearing, upon clauses 18(1) (which they argue constitutes an estoppel against any claim that the petrol tank was not in good repair at the time the lease was entered into), clause 18(2)(4) and clause 18(4)(e). Clause 18(4)(e) requires the lessee to repair ""any"" damage or breakage ""caused by lack of care or misuse by the lessee or by its employees or agents.""

89The problem is that there is no evidence of lack of care or misuse by the cross defendant. Mr Connor states that the tank had reached the end of its productive life and needed to be replaced. The reports from Tanknology are to the same effect. 

90Clause 18(5)(8) obliges the cross defendant to ensure the facilities are regularly inspected, but does not require that the lessee should then pay the cost. Similarly, clause 21(2) only imposes on the lessee the obligation to pay the lessor for work carried out if the work ""should have been carried out by the lessee"".

91In the absence of evidence that the tank failed due to lack of care or misuse by the cross defendant, the cross claimants cannot claim reimbursement for the tank costs. The costs of removal of soil were agreed to relate to removal of the tank, and must similarly be disallowed. This means that the cross claimants are not entitled to claim the items set out in 3 (a) - (h). This also means that the problems in addition which I raised with both parties on 26 September (39,586.38 instead of $59,933.18, and the lack of explanation for the increase from $9,486.80 to $20,346.80) do not need to be resolved.

92Mr Colbron, in his further submissions, argues that the underground diesel tank forms part of the property by virtue of clause 18(1) and can also be categorised as ""services and facilities"". Clause 18(e) requires the cross defendant to repair any damage to services and facilities caused by lack of care (written submissions paragraphs 18 - 21). As the cross defendant accepted the premises were in good order in October 2004 when he took over the lease, he is estopped from warranting that the premises, services and facilities were in good repair and working condition in 2006, when water was found in the tank.

93Mr Autore, for the cross defendant, submits that RA & K Becker turns on its facts, and that a lessee will not always have to repair pipes or other services which are not part of the premises.

94The additional submissions of the cross claimants are essentially a restatement of their original argument. Acknowledgments by the lessee about the state of the premises at the start of the lease do not vitiate the obligations of the landlord (or, for that matter, the tenant) to comply with repair obligations under clause 18 later on during the leaseholding. Whether or not the underground tanks form part of the leased property, the fundamental failure of a tank because it has reached the end of its life is a matter for which the landlord, not the tenant, is liable. The cross claimants are not entitled to claim these amounts. 

Items 3(i) - (ff)

95 Items 3(i) - (ff) can be dealt with globally, as these repairs are all the subject of photographs taken by the real estate agent, Mr Boreland of Laing + Simmons on 7 September 2011. The damaged state of the roll-a-door, shower and toilet is self-evident. What little I can see of the carpets in these photographs makes it clear that they were filthy. While Mrs Sutera could not now recall what the timber ($114.65) was used for, there was missing timber on the balcony, and I am prepared to accept her evidence in relation to this issue and the receipts from Bunnings and Tradelink. These costs are very modest because the cross claimants carried out these repairs themselves. The obligation of the lessee to redecorate within three months of the lease period ""however it ends"" (clause 18(3)) applies.

96According to Mrs Sutera's evidence, these items were not wear and tear; they were the result of the plaintiff/cross-defendant living on the premises, which was a breach of the terms of the lease. The cross-defendant did not deny living there. The state of the premises was poor due to the failure of the cross-defendant to honour his obligation to repair.

97These claims should be allowed in full.

Item 4 - Legal costs

98The cross defendant during the hearing abandoned the claim for the total of solicitor and client costs, but claimed the right to be able to have these bills assessed and to claim the solicitor and client proportion, on the basis that the disputes in the present proceedings have their genesis in events going back to 2006, when both sides sought legal advice in relation to disputes arising under the lease, including the replacement of the tank, the demand for outgoings which resulted in the Local Court proceedings for unpaid land tax, and the complaint by the cross defendant about failure of the landlord to effect repair. Counsel for the cross claimant relied upon general principles discussed in Re Gibson's Settlement Trusts [1981] Ch 179 at 187 and Frankenberg v Famous Lasky Film Service Ltd [1931] 1 Ch 428 at 439 - 40, arguing that the costs order in these proceedings should include these costs, which can now be the subject of a party/party costs order. It was submitted that the costs assessor, when assessing the costs of this litigation, should not be fettered by any restriction upon costs incurred prior to these proceedings being commenced or even contemplated by either party. I received submissions opposing this course from Mr Autore on 26 September 2012.

99In fact, both parties were incorrect in their assumption that the lease did not provide for legal costs. Clause 18(5)(d) specifically requires the lessee to ""indemnify"" the lessor against any expense incurred as a consequence of the breach, including ""legal costs"". This was one of the matters I raised with the parties on 26 September, when I requested further submissions on legal issues about which I required further assistance.

100Mr Colbron, in further written submissions, has set out the basis upon which legal costs are now claimed under clause 18(5). It is submitted that the legal costs were not incurred because of breaches by the lessee but relate to disputes about the matters which led to these proceedings.

101These legal costs relate to the removal of the petrol tank and contaminated soil, matters where I have made findings in favour of the cross defendant. No breakdown of the subject matter of these costs has been provided, and I am not in a position to go through them item by item. Even if some of the costs relate to issues other than the petrol tank and contaminated soil, I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that they relate to issues in this litigation, as I have no evidence to this effect and they relate to exchanges of correspondence 4 - 5 years before proceedings were commenced. Exhibit L, a bundle of legal correspondence at that time, confirms this.

102No allowance has been made for the legal costs claimed.

Item 5 - Cleaning up waste left to accumulate on the property 

103The cross claimants paid $170 to a contractor named Chris to collect rubbish from the property and incurred $50 fees from Shell Harbour City Council.

104Mr Connor states (Exhibit B) that ""the quantum claimed is deceptive and misleading"" as Chris's name on the cheque butt is illegible and the IBAS Dilapidation Report of 6 September 2011 described the condition of the premises as ""reasonable"".

105The photographs taken by Mr Boreland of Laing + Simmons on 7 September include 5 photographs of debris, as well as photographs of broken shelving left in the open, the untidy state of the grounds and oil stains (pages 7 - 11) as well as further photographs of debris and damage on pages 14 - 16. 

106These premises have been in a filthy state for years. The photographs attached to Mrs Sutera's affidavit, which were taken on 1 February and 7 March 2007, show premises covered with rusting cars, rubbish and other detritus.

107An expert has an overriding duty to the court to assist impartially, not to be an advocate for a party (UCPR Schedule 7(2)). Mr Connor's intemperate language, failure to expose his reasoning and inaccurate statements of fact on this issue undermine his credibility on this issue and on items 3(i)-(ff) above.

Item 6 - Other replacement costs

108The claims set out in item 6 were not the subject of report. Mrs Sutera has referred to these in her affidavit at pages 8 - 11. No objection was taken by the cross defendant to the late addition of these matters. Mrs Sutera was cross-examined at some length about the clothes line ($89) but not the other items. 

109The ripped awning (the principal item claimed - $2,265) was photographed by Mr Boreland (page 23) and is clearly in tatters.

110Having regard to the years in which rubbish was stored on the premises, attendance by a pest controller was warranted.

111I allow these items in full at $3034.35.

Summary of cross claim amounts





Item 1:

$11,876.60


Item 2:

$4,865.30


Item 3(a)-(h):

Item 5:

$220.00


Item 6:

$3,034.35


TOTAL:

Concluding remarks

112 There will be judgment on the cross-claim in the sum of $28,800.68. The cross defendants are entitled to damages on the amount awarded and I have granted liberty to apply.

Costs

113The plaintiff has been unsuccessful in his claim and has enjoyed only limited success on the cross-claim. Costs should follow the event. I have awarded costs of the proceedings in favour of the defendants/cross-claimants, but granted liberty to apply.

114I asked the parties for submissions as to whether there should be any special order in relation to the costs of prior hearing dates. These proceedings were listed for hearing three times prior to these sittings. The unreadiness of the plaintiff was the principal cause in relation to the first hearing, and the unreadiness of both parties on the second occasion was substantially a result of the unfortunate history of the proceedings. While the hearing was unable to go ahead on the third occasion by reason of court commitments, the plaintiff's abandonment of Fair Trading Act claims and the setting aside of the default judgment on the cross-claim were matters which required attention. I see nothing in the history of these matters warranting a variation of my order that the plaintiff/cross defendant pay the costs of these proceedings.

		28 August 2014",2012-10-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760209,NM v R [2012] NSWCCA 215,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  After a trial in the District Court before a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of five offences of sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900).  He was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of nine years and six months, comprising a non-parole period of six years and six months and an additional term of three years.
2The appellant, who is unrepresented on appeal, appeals against his convictions on the following grounds:
""1. the verdict is Unsafe and Unsound.
2. Prejudicial directions given to jury during trial and in his honours summery [sic] of trial.
3. Judicial biased [sic] against the Appellant by his honour Judge Ellis.
4. Evidence of Consent to sexual Intercourse given to the Appellant by the complainant not discredited by Crown during the trial"".
3The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence, on the following grounds:
""1. the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
2. That all the offences are one course of conduct and thus the sentences should have been concurrent.
3. The failure of his Honour to take all the mitigating factors into account when sentencing appellant"".
4By leave given at the appeal hearing, the appellant added a further ground of appeal against his sentence:  that the sentencing of the appellant did not conform with the principles stated in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154.  He withdrew ground 3 of his appeal against sentence.
5The appellant was represented by counsel at his trial and by a solicitor at his sentencing hearing.  
THE CROWN CASE AT TRIAL
The complainant's evidence
6The complainant gave evidence that she met and commenced a relationship with the appellant in 2006, when she was about 31 years old.  She and the appellant parted company a number of times before their final separation in March 2009.  The complainant had three children by a previous relationship, including AN who was aged about 13 in 2009.  In April 2009 the complainant was living in a cabin at the back of her parents' house.  After their break-up, she and the appellant continued to communicate, often by SMS texting.  The offences were alleged to have occurred on the night of 30 April 2009.
7At 7.24 pm on 30 April 2009, following earlier exchanges of messages, the complainant sent a text message to the appellant saying:  ""do U just wont to have sex that's it that's all I wont if so come to the cabin then when were dun u can leve SMS if so [sic]"".  The appellant telephoned the complainant shortly before midnight and said ""Do you still want me to come over?"", to which the complainant said ""Yes"".
8The complainant gave the following evidence as to what occurred when the appellant arrived at her cabin about three minutes later:
""Q. And when he turned up at the cabin when you saw him did you notice anything about what he looked like?A. He looked like .. (not transcribable) .. evil.  Didn't look like, didn't sound like he was intoxicated or anything it just sounded like, you'd look at him and it was like black.
Q. I just want to understand what you said.  Did you say it didn't look like he was intoxicated or--A. No, it didn't look like he was intoxicated.  He didn't sound, it just, in his eyes, it was the way he was, it was evil.
Q. So you say you noticed something about his face?A. (No verbal reply).
Q. And when he arrived at the cabin did he say anything?A. Just, no, just took off his clothes the second he came to me and he said, he said words in the effect of 'suck my cock now'.  That's what.
Q. After he said 'suck my cock' did you say anything to him?A. I said 'No, leave, leave'.  I didn't want him there.
Q. And when you said 'No, leave' what happened next?A. He pushed me, he forced me up the back, threw me like, it's like a force that moves you up and pushes you back when he got on top of me. While he was on top of me he asked me to put the condom on. I said 'No' and I asked him to leave.
Q. Was a condom in fact put on?A. He put it on while he had me down on the bed.
Q. And after he put the condom on what happened then?A. Forced it that hard inside me, but it hurt when he put it in"" (Transcript 24 May 2010, pp 3 - 4). 
9This act of penile/vaginal intercourse with a condom was the subject of Count 1 in the Indictment against the appellant.  The complainant then gave evidence of the following non-consensual intercourse that immediately ensued:  penile/anal with condom (Count 2), penile/vaginal without condom (Count 3), penile/anal without condom (Count 4) and penile/vaginal without condom and with ejaculation (Count 5).
10The complainant gave evidence that she scratched the appellant's lower back ""to try and get him off"" and that during the acts of intercourse she was crying ""all the way through"" and ""begging him to stop"".  She said that the appellant ripped her clothing and that after the appellant left she placed the torn items of clothing in a plastic bag and the used condom in a plastic container.  She said that she was bleeding and in pain as a result of the intercourse.  As the appellant left the cabin the complainant saw her daughter, AN, coming from the main house.  
11The appellant said that the following morning she told her friend, RS, that she had been raped by the appellant.  The appellant did not want to report the assaults to the police but RS ""badgered"" her to do so.  Together, they called the police.  As a result, Detective Senior Constable Bradley Boyd and Constable Rebecca Cambridge visited the complainant's home, leading to the complainant being taken by the police to a local hospital where she was examined by Dr Annette Barkey.
The complainant's daughter's evidence
12AN gave evidence that she observed her mother to be in a very distressed condition, with her clothes torn, one arm across her stomach and the other on her mouth and she was shaking and ""couldn't breathe"".  AN also heard a loud, angry male voice speaking words like ""slut"".
Subsequent text messages
13The complainant and the appellant exchanged the following text messages on 1 May 2009 (references in the messages to the names of the parties have been deleted):

Complaint evidence
15The Crown led evidence from RS, Detective Senior Constable Boyd, Constable Cambridge and Dr Barkey of complaints made to them by the complainant.
The electronically recorded interview of the appellant
16The Crown tendered an edited copy of the record of an interview Detective Boyd conducted of the appellant on 3 May 2009.
17The appellant was recorded as giving the following description of what occurred after he arrived at the complainant's home late on 30 April 2006:
""A She told me to come in.  The lights were still out at this time.  I said, 'Do you want me to turn the lights on?'  And she says, 'No, get undressed and get into bed. I want to fuck.'  They were her words.
Q44 O.K.  Yep.
A All right.  We, I think we went for about an hour and she also asked me to have anal sex with her at the same time.
Q45 Yep.
A Like, and I asked where the lubricant was.  She said she had no idea where it was, so we didn't end up using it.  Um, when we were finished, I actually got up and was getting ready to leave.  She turned around and said, 'Yeah, that'll be right.  Come here, fuck me and then just get up and leave.'  
Q46 Ah hmm.
A I said, 'Well that's what you said to me in the message that you sent me.'
Q47 Yep.
A And she turned around and said, 'Yeah, that'll be right. You don't give a shit about me whatsoever.'  I said, 'Look, I'm not putting up with this shit anymore. I'm going.  And please don't ever call me again.'  All right.  I walked out of the cabin then and there and proceeded to walk home"".
The medical evidence
18Dr Barkey gave evidence that she observed redness and tenderness, and an abrasion, in the complainant's genital area.  She also observed a ""narrow anal tear [that] extended from perianal tissue into the anus"" and stated that:
""It was very tender to palpation.  Bright blood was visible along the tear.  A tear is a full thickness penetration of skin layers due to blunt force.  The anal injury had been caused by blunt force.  This could be by penis or other object"" (Transcript 26 May 2010, p 5).
19Dr Barkey said that once the anal injury had occurred ""it would make the continuance of anal intercourse - well, because it would be so painful I think it would be unlikely that the recipient would be able to continue because it would be so painful"" (Transcript 26 May 2010, p 13).
20The Crown called evidence that presumptive tests for blood and semen on the inside, and for semen on the outside, of the condom were negative, whilst a presumptive test for blood on the outside of the condom was positive.  The condom had a very small hole about two centimetres from its tip.  
21Semen matching the DNA profile of the appellant was found in swabs from the vagina, in greater quantity in that from the high vaginal area than in that from the lower vaginal area.  Very few sperm were detected on the perianal swab and only two sperm heads were found on the anal swab.  These sperm heads, it was said, may have been ""picked up"" from outside the anus as the swab was inserted (Transcript 26 May 2010, p 40).
THE APPELLANT'S CASE AT TRIAL
22The appellant did not go into evidence at the trial.
CONVICTION APPEAL GROUND ONE:  THE VERDICT IS UNSAFE AND UNSOUND
23As the appellant's self-prepared written submissions were largely unstructured, it is convenient to adopt the Crown's categorisation of the specific matters that were put by the appellant in support of this ground of appeal.  I shall then turn to the general proposition that the verdict is unsafe and unsound.  
The cabin was pitch black so how could the complainant observe that the appellant's face ""looked evil""
24The complainant's evidence that she observed that the appellant's face ""looked evil"" was not challenged at the trial by the appellant's counsel and there is no reason to assume that there was insufficient ambient street or house lighting, or moonlight, to enable the complainant to see the appellant's face when she opened the door to let him in.
The scratch marks made by the complainant to the appellant's back were barely visible when photographed and there were no other wounds
25That only light scratches were visible in a photograph of the appellant's back taken three days after the alleged offences, and the appellant's lack of other injuries does not detract from the complainant's evidence that she did not consent to sexual intercourse with the appellant.  The complainant did not suggest that she inflicted any injuries to the appellant other than the scratches on his back.  
Text messages sent by the complainant to the appellant were an attempt by her to manipulate the appellant
26Consideration of the text messages exchanged on 1 and 2 May 2009 (see [13] and [14] above) does not support this proposition.  The messages sent by the complainant on 1 May 2009 asserted that the appellant had subjected the complainant to a traumatic experience the previous night:  ""no one has ever mad me feel so scard in my life"" [sic].  Her messages of 2 May 2009 were to similar effect, one asserting expressly that the complainant had raped her.  The appellant's responses contained no denial, seemingly asserting at one point that he did not remember what had happened.
The complainant made inconsistent complaints to RS, Constable Cambridge and Dr Barkey
27There were inconsistencies in these complaints, particularly concerning the number of acts of penile and anal intercourse.  These inconsistencies were, legitimately, the subject of cross-examination and address by the appellant's counsel at the trial.  However, they do not in my view cast doubt on the veracity of the complainant's evidence.  As pointed out by McClellan CJ at CL in Mohamed v R [2008] NSWCCA 45 at [18]:  
""Merely because there are inconsistencies in the evidence of a witness it does not follow that it should be rejected either in whole or in part. There are many reasons why inconsistencies may emerge in an account of an event by a person who has been physically threatened and subject to inordinate stress at the time the events occur. See 'Who is telling the truth? Psychology, common sense and the law.' (2006) 80 ALJ 655; see also R v Tubou [2001] NSWCCA 243 at [38]"".
28The complaints in question each involved allegations of vaginal and anal rape by the appellant but they were made on 1 and 2 May 2009, whilst the appellant was still in a distressed condition, and it is unsurprising that the emotional description given to her friend, RS, may have been unspecific as to the number and type of acts of intercourse and that she may have been confused about details when speaking to Constable Cambridge and Dr Barkey the following day.
The presence of the appellant's semen on the high vaginal swab taken from the complainant was because of the hole in the condom, not because he ejaculated without wearing a condom
29This proposition is inconsistent with the forensic evidence indicating an absence of semen on both the inside and outside of the condom (see [20] above).  That evidence also indicated that the amount of semen found on the high vaginal swab was consistent with ejaculation in that area.  It was not suggested by or to any witness that that semen may have come to be there as a result of it leaching out of a small hole on the side of the condom, rather than ejaculation when no condom was worn.
AN's observation of the complainant's appearance after the appellant left was of marginal probative value given the uncertainty as to when this observation was made
30There was no uncertainty as to when the observation was made as AN placed it on a night two days before the police visited her mother's home.  No suggestion was made to her that such a visit occurred more than once.  Moreover, the complainant's evidence of observing AN after the appellant left in the early hours of the morning on Friday 1 May 2009 confirmed that AN was speaking of the night in question.
The complainant delayed reporting the offences to the police for two days
31The evidence of the complainant and RS explained why there was a two day delay in the assaults being reported to the police:  the complainant was initially reluctant to report them but was persuaded to do so by her friend (Transcript 25 May 2010, p 42).  The appellant's counsel conceded at the trial that the complainant had made a complaint at the first opportunity (the next day) to RS, and that the delay in reporting the offences to the police was adequately explained (Transcript 26 May 2010, pp 54 - 5).
The anal tear was consistent with unlubricated penile/anal intercourse
32As noted earlier, Dr Barkey gave evidence that once the anal injury had occurred ""it would be unlikely that the recipient would be able to continue because it would be so painful"" (see [19] above).  The appellant did not indicate in his description of events, given in his recorded interview, that the complainant spoke of pain, asked him to desist because of pain or, indeed, indicated that she wished to continue with anal intercourse despite the pain.  His version of events was thus inconsistent with the injury and Dr Barkey's evidence concerning it.
33In these circumstances the evidence of the anal tear constituted significant evidence in support of the Crown case.
Whether the verdict is unsafe and unsound
34Having considered the specific points raised by the appellant in relation to this ground of appeal, it is now necessary to consider it in a more general fashion.  
35The ground invokes the power of the Court, conferred by s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to set aside a jury verdict on the ground that it is ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".  The principles applicable in determining such a ground of appeal are authoritatively stated in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.  In accordance with those principles, I have undertaken ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and to its quality"" (at [14]).  As a result I have concluded that this ground should be rejected and that the Crown discharged its onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged.
36The complainant's evidence appears to me, from the transcript, to have been credible, with the inconsistencies in her complaints not sufficient to give me cause to doubt the veracity or reliability of her evidence.  The jury's acceptance of her evidence, implicit in its verdict, indicates that there was nothing in her demeanour which required rejection of the evidence.  Her testimony is supported by the medical evidence concerning injuries to her genitalia.  This evidence, particularly when considered in light of the appellant's recorded interview, pointed strongly against the anal intercourse being consensual.  Further, the exchanges of text messages on 1 and 2 May 2009 strongly supported the complainant's version of events, containing, as they did, complaints of serious misconduct by the appellant, with no denials by him in his responses.  The evidence of AN, Constable Cambridge and Dr Barkey as to the complainant's distressed condition on 1 and 2 May 2009 similarly supported her evidence, as did the existence of scratch marks on the appellant's back.  Moreover, the forensic evidence concerning the high vaginal swab (see [21] above) was inconsistent with evidence of the appellant that he wore a condom at all times.  In my view the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to the appellant's guilt.
CONVICTION APPEAL GROUND TWO:  PREJUDICIAL DIRECTIONS GIVEN TO JURY DURING TRIAL AND IN HIS HONOUR'S SUMMARY OF TRIAL
CONVICTION APPEAL GROUND THREE:  JUDICIAL BIAS AGAINST THE APPELLANT BY HIS HONOUR JUDGE ELLIS
37I shall consider these two grounds together.  The matters put by the appellant in support of them are indicated below.
Judgment
38The appellant challenges the trial judge's decision to grant the Crown leave under s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995 to adduce evidence of a prior consistent statement of the complainant.  As the appellant's counsel did not object at the trial to the grant of leave, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules precludes the appellant from taking this point now unless this Court grants him leave to do so.  Leave should not be granted as there was no apparent error in his Honour's ruling, the appellant's counsel having cross-examined the complainant about prior, allegedly inconsistent, statements.
39Similarly, unless leave is granted, r 4 precludes the appellant now objecting to the admission of evidence of his violence earlier in the relationship, as no objection to that evidence was made at the trial.  No good reason has been given for a grant of leave under r 4.  The evidence was specifically mentioned by the Crown Prosecutor when supporting an application by both parties for a ruling that evidence of the relationship between the parties would not be precluded by s 293 of the Evidence Act.  No objection was taken by the appellant's counsel at that point, nor later when the evidence was led.  The evidence, as led, was of a brief, general nature, and did not refer to any specific incidents.
40The appellant also complains about the trial judge's decision to exclude question and answer number 189 from the tender of his Record of Interview.  I discern no error in his Honour's decision. 
Prejudicial directions
41All directions referred to by the appellant in his written submissions are contained in the trial judge's Summing-Up.  As no complaint about the Summing-Up was made by the appellant's counsel at the trial, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules again applies.  The appellant complains in particular about his Honour's directions concerning assessment of the reliability of witnesses, the significance of inconsistencies in the complainant's descriptions of events and the warning given to the jury pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act concerning the permissible use of the hearsay, complaint evidence.  However, the appellant was unable to identify any error in these directions which appear to have been well-balanced and comprehensive.  Accordingly, there is no basis for a grant of leave under r 4.
42It follows from these remarks that there is no foundation for the appellant's contentions that the trial judge's conduct of the trial manifested bias against him or that the trial judge gave erroneous directions.
CONVICTION APPEAL GROUND FOUR:  EVIDENCE OF CONSENT TO SEXUAL INTERCOURSE GIVEN TO THE APPELLANT BY THE COMPLAINANT NOT DISCREDITED BY CROWN DURING THE TRIAL
43In the written record of the appellant's interview that was in evidence, the appellant described two acts of consensual sexual intercourse (see [17] above).  The point he seeks to make by this ground of appeal is that that evidence was not discredited.  
44As the appellant did not give evidence at the trial, his version of events could not of course be challenged in cross-examination.  Nevertheless, it stood for consideration by the jury along with the other evidence adduced at the trial.  However, for the reasons I have given above, my view is that the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the five acts of sexual intercourse that were the subject of the charges against the appellant occurred and were not consensual.  This conclusion necessarily involves, as did that of the jury, the rejection of the appellant's evidence, given through the Crown's tender of his record of interview, that two acts of intercourse were consensual.
45The appellant further contends that, on the basis of the complainant's text message of 30 April 2009 and their subsequent telephone conversation, he had reasonable grounds to believe that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse that occurred.  He submitted:
""The fact that in the Complainants [sic] own evidence she admits that sending the text message inviting the Appellant over for sex and then agreeing that the Appellant called later that night and asked if it was still alright to come over for sex and the Complainant replying 'yes', this shows that the Appellant had reasonable grounds to think the Complainant was consenting to intercourse ... Any person who has gone to such length to obtain consent from another person, as the Appellant did with the Complainant, must surely be protected under the law from such an allegation [of non-consensual intercourse]"" (Written Submissions [63] and [69]).
46Whilst the complainant undoubtedly led the appellant to believe, prior to his arrival at her home, that the complainant would consent to sexual intercourse, the complainant gave evidence that she made it clear to the appellant upon his arrival, and thereafter, that she had changed her mind.  My, and the jury's, acceptance of this evidence requires the conclusion that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting to the sexual intercourse that occurred after he arrived at her home.
CONCLUSION ON CONVICTION APPEAL
47For the reasons I have given, the appellant's conviction appeal should be dismissed.
SENTENCING APPEAL GROUND ONE:  THE SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE
48A maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years is applicable to each of the offences of which the appellant was convicted.  The sentencing judge, who was also the trial judge, concluded in his Remarks on Sentence of 23 August 2010 that the offences each fell in the middle of the range of seriousness but that the offences charged in Counts 1 and 3 were slightly less serious than those charged in Counts 2 and 4 (being penile/anal intercourse) and Count 5 which involved ejaculation.
49In relation to subjective factors, the sentencing judge took into account the absence of any significant criminal history on the part of the appellant and his reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and of not re-offending.  His Honour also took into account the appellant's ""somewhat problematic"" upbringing, which left him ""poorly equipped for the emotional roller coaster of this particular relationship with the victim"" (Remarks on Sentence, p 9).
50As the appellant had not previously been in custody and the sentences were partially accumulated, his Honour found special circumstances that justified a limited change to the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term.
51He then imposed the following sentences:
Counts 1 & 3: 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5   years to date from 19 May 2010;
Counts 2 & 4: 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5½years to date from 19 November 2010;
Count 5:  8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5years to date from 19 November 2011.
OVERALL SENTENCE: 9½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6½ years to date from 19 May 2010.
52As the imposition of a sentence involves a discretionary judgment, the question for an appeal court where specific error is not shown is whether the sentence is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" or, as it is usually put, manifestly excessive (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).  As pointed out in Markarian, ""a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion"" (at [28]).  
53In my view the objective seriousness of the appellant's offences needed to be assessed in the context of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant.  As noted earlier, they had been together for some three years prior to their final break-up in March 2009.  The complainant's evidence indicated that it was a sexual relationship (Transcript 25 May 2010, p 23), with the complainant at one stage conceiving, but losing, the appellant's child (Transcript 24 May 2010, p 2).  The complainant accepted in cross-examination that after March 2009 all she sought from the appellant ""was the occasional meeting for occasional sex"" (Transcript 25 May 2010, p 24).  This evidence was consistent with the complainant asking the appellant by text message to come to her home on 30 April 2009 for sex and nothing more.  The appellant himself stated that the complainant ""had used text messages to invite him over for sex on several occasions in the passed [sic] even when they were not seeing each other"" (Appellant's Written Submissions [38]).  Psychologist George Dieter, who was asked to provide a psychological assessment of the appellant prior to his sentencing, emphasised the 'casual, sexual' nature of his relationship with the complainant, and the fact that it was ""within this emotional background that the current offence took place"" (Report 21 June 2010, p 2).  Whilst the relationship between the complainant and the appellant was conceded by the complainant to be ""fiery"" and ""on again and off again"" (ibid p 20), her feelings for the appellant must have been strong given that she sent him a text message the day after the sexual assaults, which in part read, ""u know i love you so much that's wot braken my heart im scared moor of loseing the love I have for u"".  
54His Honour does not seem to have attached any significance to the relationship in his reasoning, as he simply noted:
""that this offence was committed against the background of what had originally been a domestic relationship but which was at the time a casual sexual relationship between the victim and the offender"" (Remarks on Sentence, p 5)
55In relation to the significance of ejaculation, his Honour observed:
""I note defence submissions regarding what was said to be the lower level of criminality involved in ejaculation where there was some ongoing relationship, as distinct from a stranger situation.  I am not sure that this is a legitimate distinction to make, but in any event it does seem to me that even in relationship situations the fact of ejaculation without a condom can properly be seen as an aggravating factor"" (p 6).
56The significance in sentencing of a relationship between an offender and a victim was considered by this Court in Bellchambers v R [2011] NSWCCA 131.  In that case, offences under s 61I of the Crimes Act were committed on four occasions over a four year period, commencing a year after a relationship commenced between the victim and the applicant.  The offences were accompanied by force and threats.  In the course of his judgment Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) (with whom Campbell JA and RS Hulme J agreed) said:
""47 There was also a difficulty in his Honour's failure to review the facts, both relating to the circumstances of the offences and in relation to the applicant's personal and medical circumstances. A review of the offences would have revealed that while serious they occurred in a domestic relationship which involved considerable ambivalence on the part of the complainant. Whilst sexual assault even within the confines of a continuing relationship cannot be condoned, that fact and the comparatively low level of violence are matters of relevance to the objective seriousness of the offences. Regrettably, that comment is made against the background of sexual assaults which come before this Court involving very considerable threats and violence. 
...
51 In [re-sentencing] I should record my view that each of the first three offences was, because of the factors I have identified, substantially below the midrange of objective seriousness, albeit not at the bottom of that range. The applicant's persistence in the face of the complainant's greater resistance in the case of the second offence makes that one somewhat more serious than the first.
52 The fourth offence was also appreciably below the midrange although, because it was committed in the context of the threats made on the previous day, more serious than the previous three"".
57The applicant was re-sentenced for the four offences to terms of imprisonment of three, four, four and five years respectively, with non-parole periods of two years for all offences other than the fourth offence for which the non-parole period was three years.  After significant accumulation, no doubt influenced by the two year periods separating the first and second offences and also the second and third and fourth offences, the total sentence imposed was seven years with a non-parole period of five years. 
58The importance of considering the nature of the relationship between an offender and victim was also emphasised in R v Hendricks [2011] NSWCCA 203 at [86], in that case, in the context of consideration of the extent of concurrence of sentences.  That a prior sexual relationship between a victim and an offender may, depending upon the particular circumstances of the case, be an important mitigating factor in sentencing for sexual offences was recognised by the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal in Wiren v R (1996) 89 A Crim R 356 at 360 and following.  See also R v Mason [2001] VSCA 62 at [6] and [7].
59In the present case, the complainant suffered considerable pain as a result of the forced anal intercourse and her text messages of 1 and 2 May 2009 indicate that she suffered considerable emotional trauma as a result of the sexual assaults.  However, in light of her lengthy prior sexual relationship with the appellant and the intermittent sexual relationship that still existed at the time of the offences, I do not consider that the offences can be equated to those involving sexual assaults by strangers, which must almost inevitably give rise to extreme terror and fear in the mind of the victim.  Here, the victim had been prepared until moments before the assaults to have sexual intercourse with the appellant, and the complainant had indeed, only three minutes before the appellant's arrival at her home, invited him over for that very purpose.  My view is that in these circumstances the sentencing judge erred in characterising the offences as falling within the mid-range of seriousness.  They were in my view well below that, although not at the bottom of the range.  
60These comments are in no way intended to suggest that the appellant's offences were not serious.  He committed serious criminal offences deserving of severe punishment.  However, the sentences that the sentencing judge imposed, amounting to an overall sentence of nine and a half years with a non-parole period of six and a half years, were in my view manifestly excessive in light of the particular circumstances of the case.
SENTENCING APPEAL GROUND TWO:  THAT ALL THE OFFENCES ARE ONE COURSE OF CONDUCT AND THUS THE SENTENCES SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONCURRENT
61The principles relating to concurrency and accumulation of sentences were comprehensively summarised by Hall J in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 at [52].  It is sufficient for present purposes to say that those principles require the aggregate of the sentences for multiple offences to reflect their total criminality even though they may have been committed in the course of a single episode.  In my view it was open to the sentencing judge to find that some accumulation was necessary in the present case on the basis that it could not be said that the criminality of each of the offences was completely comprehended by that of the others.  The extent of accumulation was a matter for the sentencing judge and, if I had not been of the view that the sentences imposed were otherwise open to challenge, I would have concluded that the course he adopted fell within the range of accumulation that was reasonably open to him.
SENTENCING APPEAL GROUND THREE:  HIS HONOUR FAILED TO TAKE ALL OF THE MITIGATING FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SENTENCING THE APPELLANT
62This ground was withdrawn.
SENTENCING APPEAL GROUND FOUR:  SENTENCING OF THE APPELLANT DID NOT CONFORM WITH THE PRINCIPLES STATED IN MULDROCK v R
63No criticism of the sentencing judge is implicit in this ground, or in what I say below, as his Honour, quite properly, applied the law as it stood at the date of sentencing.  Nevertheless, the sentences imposed are open to challenge if his Honour's reasoning did not conform with the subsequently published decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154.  That decision has been considered in a number of subsequent decisions in this Court including R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44.  
64Muldrock precludes a sentencing judge from attributing determinative significance to the standard non-parole period.  As the High Court said in that case:
""[28]  Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period"". 
65In my view the sentencing judge in the present case appears to have adopted the approach now proscribed by Muldrock.  Having determined that the objective seriousness of the offences lay in the middle of the range of seriousness, his Honour said:
""S 54B subs (2) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act] permits a court to impose a longer or shorter non parole period even when the standard non parole period applies, that is where an offence is a mid range offence after trial.  Apart from the objective mitigating factors there are a number of subjective factors of a general nature as well as those which fall within s 21A"" (Remarks on Sentence, p 7).
Later, his Honour said:
""The Court notes that sentencing is an intuitive process and not some mathematical formulation and that that is so even when the standard non parole period applies.  That is that the Court does not have to, in determining to shorten a standard non parole period for reasons set out in s 21A or in the common law, propose to nominate a percentage discount or a period of time by which the standard non parole period is reduced by any of the particular objective or subjective mitigating factors"" (ibid, p 9).
66Although there is room for doubt, this reasoning appears to me to attribute greater significance to the standard non-parole period than is permitted, with the result that this reasoning is erroneous.
RE-SENTENCING
67Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, provides as follows:
""(3)  On an appeal under section 5 (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal"".
68It follows from my finding that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive that I consider, as contemplated by s 6(3), that ""some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed"".  I therefore proceed to consider the re-sentence of the appellant.
69Whilst it is appropriate to have regard to the applicable maximum sentence of 15 years and the standard non-parole period of seven years, the appropriate sentences for the appellant's offences should be determined by reference to all relevant factors.  This requires the making of a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all those factors (Muldrock v R at [26] quoting McHugh J in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51]). 
70Taking into account the factors to which I have referred and those referred to by the sentencing judge in his Remarks on Sentence, my view is that the appellant should be re-sentenced in respect of Counts 1 and 3 to concurrent terms of imprisonment of four years, with non-parole periods of three years each to date from 19 May 2010, and in respect of Counts 2, 4 and 5, to concurrent terms of imprisonment of five years, with non-parole periods of three and a half years each, also to date from 19 May 2010.  
71The aggregate sentence that I propose is accordingly a term of imprisonment of five years, with a non-parole period of three and a half years to date from 19 May 2010.  I have not allowed for any accumulation as the additional criminality of the three offences involving anal intercourse and penile/vaginal intercourse with ejaculation (Counts, 2, 4 and 5) is in my view sufficiently reflected in the longer sentences imposed for those offences, which have the effect of lengthening the aggregate sentence.  I am satisfied, in accordance with the principle of totality, that the aggregate sentence reflects the total criminality of the appellant's conduct.  The ratio of the balance of term to the non-parole period in respects of Counts 2, 4 and 5 differs from the statutory ratio but I find special circumstances on the basis that as the appellant has not previously been in custody, an extended period of supervision whilst he is on parole is appropriate.  
ORDERS
72For the reasons that I have given, I propose the following orders:
(1) Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
(2) Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
(3) Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 23 August 2010.
(4) In substitution for the sentences imposed on 23 August 2010, sentence the appellant as follows:
Counts 1 and 3:  concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4 years with non-parole periods of 3 years each to date from 19 May 2010.
Counts 2, 4 and 5:  concurrent terms of imprisonment of 5 years with non-parole periods of 3 years and 6 months each to date from 19 May 2010.
Overall sentence:  imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months to date from 19 May 2010.
The earliest date upon which the appellant is eligible for release on parole is 19 November 2013.
73McCALLUM J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.  It is appropriate to say something about ground 1 in the conviction appeal. As stated by the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493, an appeal on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence raises a question of fact which this Court must decide ""by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"".  In applying that test, I have undertaken my own independent assessment of the evidence.  For the reasons set out in the judgment of Macfarlan JA, which I gratefully adopt, I think that upon the whole of the evidence it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt.   
74GROVE AJ:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2760220,R v Serone [2012] NSWSC 1232,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Rodney Boyd White killed a drug dealer so that he could steal his drugs. Todd Andrew Serone (the offender) helped him to conceal evidence of the killing and today stands for sentence for being an accessory after the fact to murder.

2The offender was tried jointly with White and Jessica Birkensleigh. White was charged with murder and was found guilty. His sentence proceedings have been delayed. Birkensleigh was found guilty of being an accessory before the fact to robbery. She was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.

3Another man, Ricky Humphries, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years. Yet another who was involved, Peter Elefsen, received from the Attorney General an indemnity from prosecution for being an accessory after the fact and gave evidence for the prosecution. 

Facts

4The trial was relatively lengthy and the evidence somewhat complex. However, the facts can be stated quite succinctly.

Relationship between Messrs Serone, White and Zaiter

5The offender lived at West Tweed Heads. He had skills as a mechanic and auto-electrician. He had worked on cars owned by Rodney White and the deceased, Saaid (Sid) Zaiter. He described them as ""good payers"". He regarded himself as being a friend of White whereas the deceased was more of a business associate (T1032; 1086).

6The offender believed that both men were involved in the drug trade and that in some way their respective drug businesses overlapped. He said that the relationship between the two centred on the buying and selling of drugs (T1086). Drugs were transported to the Far North Coast and Gold Coast regions, and motor vehicles that were serviced by the offender were used for this purpose. The offender agreed that, despite this being his understanding of the activities of Rodney White and Sid Zaiter, he was still prepared to associate with them and to have White as a friend (T1087). 

7The offender's automotive business had declined by late 2008. He agreed with the proposition that his livelihood at that point depended very much on the continued business that was being put his way by White and Zaiter (T1089).

The murder of Mr Zaiter

8On Tuesday 16 December 2008 Rodney White lured Sid Zaiter to a cabin in a caravan park at Chinderah on the pretext of doing a drug deal with some buyers from Melbourne. Within that cabin he assaulted him to the point of rendering him unconscious, at least. He then bound him with cable ties and taped over his mouth and nose so that, if he was not dead already, he would die soon after. In the ensuing hours White oversaw the transporting of Mr Zaiter's car to a clearing (it was also referred to as a ""quarry"") just off the Murwillumbah-Kyogle Road at Barkers Vale, where packages of drugs were retrieved from it before it was destroyed by fire. He also arranged for the body to be collected from the cabin at Chinderah and transported ultimately to Pinnacle lookout in the Border Ranges National Park, where it was unceremoniously stripped naked and thrown off into the bush.

9Rodney White later made jokes about the killing of Mr Zaiter. A witness said that he referred to him as ""the bushman"" because that was where his body was, and he referred to Mr Zaiter as having reached ""the pinnacle of his life"".

10Rodney White and Jessica Birkensleigh, who was his girlfriend, quickly left the area and travelled to Victoria. There they established a new life for themselves that was funded with the proceeds of the drugs that had been stolen from Mr Zaiter.

11The offender's involvement commenced after the killing of Mr Zaiter. At White's request, he arranged for Mr Zaiter's car to be towed from Chinderah to Barkers Vale. It was the Crown case that he helped White strip the interior of the car in order to find drugs secreted within it before White set fire to it. He then travelled to Coolangatta airport and hired a car that he used to go to the caravan park, retrieve Mr Zaiter's body, and take it back to where White was waiting on the Murwillumbah-Kyogle Road at Uki. The body was then transferred to the car that White was in. The offender then returned home while White proceeded to dispose of the body.

12A long and difficult police investigation (for which the officers involved should be commended) eventually established what had occurred. The remains of Mr Zaiter's body were located 12 months to the day after the murder. Only 12 bones remained.

The ""defence"" of duress

13The sole issue in the trial concerning the offender was his claim to have acted under duress. He did not otherwise dispute the Crown case. He is to be given credit on sentence for his co-operation in the efficient conduct of the trial: s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

14It was submitted that I should find that Rodney White threatened the offender in the manner described in his evidence before the jury. This, it was common ground, would be consistent with the jury's verdict because it would allow for the possibility that the jury accepted the offender's evidence, but also accepted either, that a reasonable person would not have succumbed to such threats by acting as the offender did, or that the offender could have avoided the effects of the duress by escaping without damage to himself or others. It is a statutory mitigating factor if found on the balance of probabilities, of which the offender bears the onus, that he was acting under duress: s 21A(3)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. See also Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215. 

15It is necessary to review the evidence given before the jury concerning the claim of duress in some detail in order to explain the conclusion that I have reached. 

16I accept that the offender had no knowledge of Rodney White having killed Sid Zaiter until the car that had been retrieved from the caravan park arrived at the quarry at Barkers Vale. According to the offender, it was there that White told him that he had got into a fight with Sid and that Sid was dead (T1045). The offender asked whether he was joking and White replied, ""No, I'm not joking, I am deadly serious"". The offender said that he was shocked when White then set fire to the car. He ran back to the tow truck where his friend, Alan Waters, was waiting and told him, ""Let's get the hell out of here"" (T1046). 

17As Waters and the offender were driving back and were near Murwillumbah, the car in which Rodney White was a passenger indicated to them to stop. Waters pulled the tow truck over. The offender alighted and White approached him. White said, ""These blokes are from Melbourne, they're hitmen. Too many people know what has happened. I need you to go to the airport, get a hire car, go back to the cabin, remove the body or you and your family will be next"" (T1046) meaning ""that me and my family will be dead"" (T1047). The ""blokes"" White referred to were Ricky Humphries and Peter Elefsen, two men who were with White who he had enlisted to help. The offender did not know them. He said he was ""petrified"". He ""freaked out"". It brought back the distressing memory of having found his mother's body after she had been brutally murdered some years before. 

18Rodney White then directed Waters and the offender to give Humphries and Elefsen a lift to Coolangatta airport. He said to the offender, ""Don't speak to these blokes"" or ""Don't look at them and don't talk to them"" (T1047). The four then proceeded in the tow truck to the airport. There was not much conversation on the way. When they arrived Mr Waters dropped them off and left. The offender went with Humphries and Elefsen to the Avis counter. He said that he did the talking; he asked to hire the car. He was told that he would need a credit card. None of them had one. The offender rang Mr Waters and asked him to return and collect them. They then went to the offender's home at West Tweed Heads and Mr Waters returned to his own home to see if his wife could assist with a credit card. 

19The offender sat out the back of his house with the two men. His brother was in the backyard but he did not tell him of his predicament. He went inside to get everyone a glass of water. He said he was ""shaking like a leaf"". 

20Eventually Mrs Waters arrived and she gave the three men a lift back to the airport. Once there, she came inside the terminal with the offender and Elefsen while Humphries watched them from outside. Mrs Waters left once a car had been hired using her credit card.

21The three men got into the hire car and drove towards Chinderah. On the way, the offender claimed that Elefsen said, ""Do you know who we are?"" He replied in the negative. Elefsen told him, ""We're hitmen from Melbourne"".

22Elefsen directed the offender to turn off at a Bunnings store in Tweed Heads where Elefsen purchased a tarpaulin, tape and gardening gloves. The offender said that Elefsen spoke of needing to cut some carpet. The offender, who had some experience with carpet laying, suggested that they buy a Stanley knife.

23They then proceeded to the cabin at Chinderah. Elefsen opened a roller door, directed the offender to reverse in, and then closed the roller door. All three went inside. Mr Zaiter's body was lying in the kitchen with the hands bound. The offender said that he did not want to look. He said, ""It was reliving a nightmare"". Humphries dragged the body into the lounge room. Elefsen directed the offender to cut out a section of blood stained carpet. While he was doing this he glanced at what the others were doing. He said that Elefsen looked at him and ""I just thought there and then that I'm going to be next, that they're going to topple [sic - top me?] here"" (T1053). The offender also gave this evidence:

Q. When it came to the removal of Sid's body out of the cabin, what role did you play thereafter? 
A. I just picked up the box of tape and the gloves and the plastic wrapper and so forth and rolled the carpet up and I carried that out. The other two blokes were carrying the body (T1052-1053).

24The body was placed in the boot of the car. The offender said that he closed the door on the way out. They then drove out to Uki where they met up with Rodney White. Humphries and Elefsen alighted and got into the other car with White. White directed the offender to follow them. They drove a further 10 minutes up the road and turned off down a dirt track and stopped. White got out and directed the offender to reverse the car up and to pop the boot. He did that and the others then transferred the body from one car to the other. White then said ""I'll catch you later"" and drove off with the others. The offender went home.

25The offender's evidence in chief concluded with the following:

Q. Mr Serone, if it weren't for the threats that you you've described that night, would you have done any of the things that you described you in fact did to collect, secure and deliver the body of Sid Zaiter? 
A. No way. (T1065)

Rejection of duress

26In my view it is not hard to understand why the jury rejected as a reasonable possibility that the offender was acting under duress. His evidence on the subject was, in my view, incapable of belief. I say that for the following reasons.

27As a starting point I acknowledge that Rodney White was a devious and manipulative man. I said in sentencing Ricky Humphries: R v Humphries [2012] NSWSC 419 at [41]:

I also have the advantage of having presided over the trial of White and have observed him giving evidence. I have no doubt that he is a most belligerent, arrogant and manipulative person.

28The offender and Rodney White were on friendly terms. So too were Humphries and Elefsen. It does not make sense that it was necessary for White to enlist the offender's assistance by threatening him and his family with death. There had been nothing to indicate to White that the offender, his friend, would not be prepared to co-operate. There was no suggestion of him enlisting the assistance of Humphries and Elefsen by doing any more than simply telling them what he wanted them to do. This is the primary reason why I regard the offender's claim as incredible but there are other reasons that contribute to my conclusion.

29The offender said that when they were stopped in Murwillumbah, and Rodney White directed Alan Waters and himself to take Humphries and Elefsen to Coolangatta airport in order to hire a car, White directed in relation to Humphries and Elefsen, ""Don't speak to these blokes"" or ""Don't look at them and don't talk to them"" (T1047). It is difficult to understand how that could be possible when it was supposedly White's plan that ""these blokes"" were to accompany the offender from Murwillumbah to Coolangatta and then to Chinderah, retrieve a body and then drive it back into the hinterland.

30There were a number of things that the offender said that he did that are inconsistent with the actions of somebody who was reluctant to assist. He was the one who did the talking when the men arrived at the hire car desk at the airport. When they were told they could not hire a car without a credit card, rather than indicating to the others that the situation was hopeless, he took the initiative of arranging with Mr and Mrs Waters for a credit card to be made available. When they were supposedly at the Bunnings store and Peter Elefsen spoke of the need to cut some carpet, it was the offender who made the suggestion that they should purchase a Stanley knife. These are not the actions of an unwilling accessory after the fact.

31The claim that a visit was made to a Bunnings store came only from the offender. Elefsen denied it and appeared completely nonplussed when the proposition was put to him in cross-examination (T420-421). He did not even know there was a Bunnings store in Tweed Heads.

32I have mentioned that the offender was asked what he did as Ricky Humphries and Peter Elefsen carried the body out of the cabin and that he replied, ""I just picked up the box of tape and the gloves and the plastic wrapper and so forth"". He also said that he closed the door of the cabin as he left. It is rather extraordinary that someone concealing evidence of a murder, but only because of duress, would take it upon himself to be so helpful and thorough.

33Another matter that is detrimental to the credibility of the offender is that Megan Waters gave evidence that she went with him to the car hire counter at the airport while the other two men (Humphries and Elefsen) waited outside (T504.40). She was not challenged about that. Her evidence in this respect was consistent with what Mr Elefsen had said (T316). The offender, on the other hand, claimed that Elefsen accompanied them while Humphries waited at the door, watching from a distance (T1050.6). 

34If the version of Mrs Waters and Mr Elefsen was correct, there was a clear opportunity for the offender to have either raised the alarm or to have otherwise thwarted Rodney White's plan. Similar is the failure of the offender to say anything to his brother while he was at home, waiting for the Waters to come up with a credit card; and the failure to take the opportunity to call the police when he went inside the house to fetch glasses of water while Humphries and Elefsen waited in the backyard.

35It did not help the offender's cause, either, that he was forced to admit that he had lied to the jury about making calls to Mr Zaiter's phone in the days following the murder even though he knew that he was dead. He was also forced to concede in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor that he was ""a frequent relentless liar"" in what he had told the police. (T1075 - 1082)

36He also lied when he told the jury ""I don't source drugs or take drugs or sell them"" (T1061.20). The offender well knew that he had been a frequent user of drugs since about 2004. He was to later concede that he was a daily user of up to two grams of amphetamine at the end of 2008 (T1126).

37The issue of duress largely depended upon the evidence of Elefsen on the one hand and the offender on the other. White, of course, denied the offender's claims but his evidence could not be believed on any issue where it was not independently supported. Elefsen impressed as a witness who gave evidence in a straightforward, matter of fact style. His memory as to conversations was obviously hampered by the passage of time. He was an accomplice and the jury were warned as to the potential unreliability of evidence from such a person. However, I did not have any suspicion at any stage of his evidence that he was doing anything other than trying to give an account from an honest recollection of what actually happened. He was a far more impressive witness than the offender.

38Mr Elefsen's account was generally to the effect that it was the offender who directed what was to occur from the time when they left Murwillumbah through until they returned with the body to where Rodney White was waiting. He had no idea that the purpose of their journey was to retrieve a body until they arrived at the caravan park. He had been given to understand by White that the purpose of hiring a car was so that White could travel to Western Australia.

39When asked if there was any evidence that supported the offender's claim of duress, Mr Walmsley SC referred to the evidence of the tow truck driver, Mr Waters. It included that there had been some conversation on the way to the airport about the weather in Melbourne. It was submitted that this supported the offender's account that there had been reference to Messrs Elefsen and Humphries to Mr Waters and the offender as being ""hitmen from Melbourne"". Rhetorically, why else would there have been the reference to Melbourne?

40Clearly, there was some discussion in the tow truck concerning Melbourne. Peter Elefsen gave evidence of it as well. He explained that he and Humphries were not acquainted with the pair in the tow truck. Rodney White had told them before they got into the tow truck, ""Don't tell him where you live"". That was supposedly because White had told either the offender, or Mr Waters, or both, at the roadside at Murwillumbah that he and Humphries were from Melbourne (T311). 

41Mr Elefsen, however, denied in cross-examination that there was any conversation in the tow truck about he and Humphries being ""hitmen"". It was not put directly to Mr Waters that there was such a conversation and he said nothing to support the proposition. 

42Mr Waters also gave some other evidence that, if accepted, could be regarded as supporting the claim of duress (T490). This related to things Mr Waters had said in a statement he made the Friday before the Monday on which he gave his evidence. It is unsurprising that no reliance was placed upon it in the submissions on sentence because it was ultimately left in the trial in a confused and unsatisfactory state (T497 - 501).

43To conclude on this issue, whilst I am prepared to accept that Rodney White was a manipulative and domineering character, I am not prepared to accept that he threatened the offender in the way that has been claimed.

Seriousness of the offence

44The offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder can be committed in a very wide variety of circumstances: R v Farroukh and Farroukh (Court of Criminal Appeal, 29 March 1996, unreported).

45Factors relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of such an offence have been considered: see R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104, cited recently by Davies J in R v Hogden [2012] NSWSC 24 at [50]; R v Ward [2004] NSWSC 420; R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205; and R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408. My assessment of the seriousness of the present offence has been informed by the factors considered in those cases. 

46The assistance provided by the offender in the present case, from the time he became aware of what had actually occurred, comprised (a) accompanying Peter Elefsen and Ricky Humphries to the airport for the purpose of hiring a car to transport the body of the deceased; (b) being proactive in overcoming the obstacle to the hire of the car (obtaining a credit card); (c) accompanying Elefsen and Humphries to Chinderah and retrieving the body; (d) making some endeavour, at an elementary level, to clean up the crime scene; and (e) conveying the body back into the hinterland and transferring it into the possession of the murderer for the purpose of its disposal.

47It is relevant that it has not been shown that the offender was aware of the tasks that lay ahead until he found himself in the quarry at Barkers Vale and later by the roadside at Murwillumbah. He was, in effect, thrust into the situation without prior warning. However, the assistance he provided was considerable; it continued over a period of some hours; and it involved directing the activities of Messrs Elefsen and Humphries.

48The assistance provided was not, as is sometimes encountered, a product of a sense of emotional attachment, but it could be regarded as being motivated by misguided loyalty to a friend with a domineering personality. There was no suggestion of the offender being prompted to act out of a desire for personal advantage. Assisting in the disposal of a body is, however, a feature that elevates the seriousness of an offence of this nature.

49This is by no means the worst example of being accessory after the fact to murder but it is also by no means at the other end of the scale either.

Subjective features

50The offender was born in 1971 and so was aged 37 at the time of the offence and is now aged 41. 

51He has two brothers. His father is in his sixties and is obviously supportive of the offender as he was in attendance in the public gallery throughout the trial and the sentence proceedings. A disgruntled former employee of a family business brutally murdered the offender's mother in 1999. The experience of finding her body has led to him being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) for which he has not received treatment.

52The offender was educated to Year 10 level. He then completed an auto-electrical apprenticeship. He continued in employment for a further three years and then opened his own business in partnership. That business failed when in about 1997 his partner committed suicide after having embezzled a significant sum of money.

53The offender opened another business that traded until about 2007 or 2008. He then worked in the family carpet business until his arrest in March 2010. 

54The offender commenced a relationship in about 1995 and married in about 2000. A daughter presently aged 7 now lives with her mother in Queensland but the offender has maintained contact by telephone. He also has a son aged 5 as a result of another relationship which has broken down. This woman moved with the son to Melbourne and the offender has lost contact.

55Misuse of alcohol and drugs has been an intermittent problem. The offender smoked cannabis from the age of 16 until he was about 22. He abused alcohol in his late teens and early twenties. He then remained substance free until the age of 33 when he commenced using amphetamines. This was in about 2004, around the time of the breakdown of his first relationship and in the aftermath of the trauma relating to the death of his mother. He told Mr Watson-Munro, the author of a psychological report that was tendered on sentence, that he had been struggling with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety and other symptoms of PTSD. 

56Mr Watson-Munro opined that the offender's abuse of stimulants at the time of the index offence affected his judgment. However, Mr Watson-Munro's opinions must be regarded with some circumspection because they proceed upon an acceptance of the offender's account of having acted under duress. 

57It is positive that the offender has apparently abstained from any illicit drug use for the past two and a half years that he has been in custody. He told Mr Watson-Munro that his judgment and insight had improved substantially. He is currently experiencing elevated levels of anxiety and depression but that seems referrable to his conviction and his anticipation of sentence.

58The report of Mr Watson-Munro concludes with an opinion that the offender needs treatment for the broad range of psychological symptoms he is experiencing. One would hope that such treatment might be available to him in the custodial environment or, failing that, while he is supervised under parole. 

59The offender was arrested on 9 March 2010 and has been in custody since. That period has not been solely referrable to this matter. Between the commission of the present offence and his arrest, he became involved in the systematic and regular supply of ecstasy and methylamphetamine, albeit in relatively small quantities. He was charged with two counts of supplying prohibited drugs. He was also charged with possessing a shortened firearm without authorisation or permit. He pleaded guilty to those charges and asked that seven other offences be taken into account; three of possessing prohibited drugs; one of possessing a restricted substance; and three firearms related offences. All of these offences arose from the execution of a search warrant at his home on 6 August 2009. 

60Black DCJ imposed sentence in respect of these matters on 20 May 2011. The total effective sentence was one of 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months. The sentences were specified to commence on 20 May 2011. Entitlement to release on parole occurred on 19 August 2012. The total sentence will expire on 19 November 2013.

61A number of testimonials were tendered at the sentencing hearing last Monday. The offender was variously described as a person who is honest, fair, trustworthy, punctual, hardworking, well-respected, generous, kind, industrious and dependable. There is also confirmation of the deleterious effect of the tragic death of his mother. None of the authors mention anything about the offender's use of illegal drugs but, aside from that, it is clear that he has a number of positive personal qualities. I accept that he has considerable support that bodes well for him upon his eventual return to the community.

62Corrective Services case notes relating to the offender's conduct since coming into custody were also tendered. They confirm that he has been a polite, compliant and industrious inmate. There are repeated comments about his work ethic and the pride he takes in the tasks he is assigned. There is also some concern expressed about his past association with members of outlaw motorcycle gangs. I do not know enough about that so I have put it to one side.

63I accept the submission of Mr Walmsley that the offending behaviour in 2008 and 2009 should be regarded as an isolated period amounting to a ""fall from grace"". The offender's life had been one that was concentrated upon work and family but this began to unravel following the death of his mother, the breakdown of his marriage, and the commencement of his use of amphetamines. His contact with the deceased and Rodney White was partly to do with his working on their cars but his use of illicit drugs must have been a factor as well. 

64The offender has now severed his association with drugs and with the likes of Rodney White. His prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending appear to be good.

Other sentencing considerations

65The maximum penalty for being an accessory after the fact to murder is imprisonment for 25 years: s 349(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

66It is necessary to impose a sentence that takes into account the various purposes of sentencing: s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Of these, general deterrence is particularly important in relation to those who assist murderers to evade justice.

67Another consideration is the need to take into account the period which the offender has been in custody to date. Part of that period has involved serving the non-parole period for the drug supply and firearm offences for which he was sentenced in the District Court. They were entirely distinct offences. I have had regard to the principle of totality and have determined that there should be no period of concurrency. That means that I should specify the commencement of the sentence on a date that is 15 months after he came into custody, that being the length of the non-parole period imposed in the District Court.

68Judicial Commission sentencing statistics were tendered but they are of little utility because the circumstances in which this offence can be committed are so varied. Another factor detracting from their utility is that there are only a small number of cases in the database. I have since had a look at the statistics online. The number of cases in the database has slightly increased from the version tendered before me to 17. I note, however, that of those 17, all but one involved a plea of guilty. Presumably then, 16 of the cases involved a significant reduction of the sentence and, for that reason, reliance upon the statistics in a case not involving a plea of guilty is likely to be misleading.

69I have considered whether there are special circumstances that would warrant reducing the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period. All of the subjective circumstances I have referred to have been taken into account in the assessment of the total term of the sentence. The offender's need for treatment as recommended by Mr Watson-Munro is not something that requires a longer than usual parole period. There is, however, a need to take into account that the offender has been in custody since 9 March 2010. An adjustment of the non-parole and parole periods is necessary so that the latter will be a period that is closer to the usual one-quarter of the total period of incarceration. For this reason alone I find that there are special circumstances.

Victim impact statement

70As a final matter, but by no means least, I wish to acknowledge the victim impact statement by Ms Suzee Nader, the niece of the deceased. Ms Nader wrote of how Saaid had been ""the back bone of our very tight knit family, he was our life line, he was our everything"". She describes the many ways in which the family have suffered immense grief and loss. As is understandable, she acknowledges the practical reality that whatever sentences are imposed upon those who are responsible, they ""will never be enough"". I wish to record my condolences to Ms Nader and all who have been affected by the tragic brutality of the murder of their loved one.

Sentence

71Convicted.

72Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 6 months. The sentence is to date from 9 June 2011. The offender will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 8 December 2014. The total term of the sentence will expire on 8 June 2016.

		12 October 2012",2012-10-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760233,R v Butler [2012] NSWSC 1227,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 4 September 2012, Patricia Mary Butler (to whom I shall usually refer as ""the offender"" in these remarks) was arraigned on an indictment containing two counts. The first alleged that on 31 July 2010 she murdered Brendan Potter (to whom I shall usually refer as ""the deceased""). An alternative count of having committed the manslaughter of the same person was contained in the indictment. The offender pleaded not guilty to the count of murder but guilty to the count of manslaughter. The Crown accepted the latter plea in full discharge of the indictment, on the basis that the Crown could not disprove beyond reasonable doubt the partial defence of provocation. As a result of that process, the offender comes before Court today to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter. 

Approach to findings of fact

2Many of the facts in the matter, whether objective or subjective, are not in dispute. In particular, a document containing agreed facts was tendered, and it reflected extensive concordance between the parties. Furthermore, a psychological report relating to the offender was tendered by her counsel, and, although there was some dispute by the Crown with regard to diagnoses contained in that document, the history provided by the offender to the psychologist was not disputed. 

3With regard to any facts that are in dispute, I am required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any matters adverse to the offender, and to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of any matters that are in her favour: see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270. It may be that there will be some aspects of the matter with regard to which I am unable to come to a firm conclusion. 

The events of 31 July 2010

4Early in the morning of Saturday 31 July 2010, the offender was working as a street prostitute in Kings Cross. The deceased approached her from his motor vehicle, and it was agreed between them that they would travel to a secluded part of Rushcutters Bay, where she would perform oral sex upon him for the sum of $70. They travelled to that nearby suburb, and the offender commenced to perform that act. Whilst she was doing so, the deceased as part of his obtaining sexual gratification, said some things about sexual assault of children. The offender reacted adversely to what the deceased said, but did not bring the arrangement to an end or seek to leave his car. To the contrary, it was agreed between the two of them that they would return to the flat of the offender in Macleay Street Potts Point, where she would perform a further sexual act upon the deceased in return for the sum of $150. 

5They arrived there very early in the morning. The two of them were alone in a room together. The offender complied with a request from the deceased that she dress herself in particular clothes. The deceased had brought a laptop computer with him, and he connected to an interactive site on the internet whereby one can watch so-called ""models"" performing sexual acts in real time in return for money. The offender was in a position to see what was being shown on the computer screen, and she saw that one of the people depicted appeared to the offender to be an 11 or 12 year old girl. That further disturbed the offender.

6Thereafter, the offender performed oral sex on the deceased again. Whilst she was doing so, the deceased made reference to having had sex with her when she was a child. He additionally said something about having placed his penis in the mouth of the younger sister of the offender when she was a little girl and whilst she was asleep.

7Those things were said by the deceased in order to heighten his arousal from what the offender was doing. In fact, they were fantasies, because in truth he had never met the offender or her sister before that night. 

8Tragically, those enunciated sexual fantasies of Mr Potter were to lead almost immediately to his violent death. 

9Unbeknown to the deceased, the offender had been a victim of the crime of child sexual assault for many years. Those offences were committed against her by her stepfather, when she was between the ages of 8 and 15 years. They included many and varied acts of sexual intercourse, and, on at least one occasion, her stepfather saw fit to invite a friend of his to have sex with his stepdaughter whilst he watched. As a defence mechanism, the offender would adopt the strategy of psychologically dealing with these repeated crimes by ""blanking out"" during them; in other words, going into some sort of dissociative state. Furthermore, the stepfather would threaten the offender that, if she told anyone about what he was doing to her, she would be taken from the family, and he would be free to prey upon the little sisters of the offender (in fact her stepsisters). That threat was one of the reasons why the offender did not reveal what was being done to her whilst she was a child. 

10A month or so before her encounter with the deceased, the offender had been sexually assaulted whilst she was working as a prostitute. The way in which that crime had been committed had some similarities with the way in which her stepfather had sexually assaulted her years before. At the time of the commission of that offence, the offender was powerfully reminded of what she had suffered in her childhood. In fact, it was only on the night that she encountered the deceased that the offender had returned to her work as a street prostitute. 

11In short, completely unbeknown to the deceased, the offender had a special sensitivity with regard to child sexual assault, which had been exacerbated some weeks before, and she had an extreme sensitivity to the thought of sexual assault upon her little sister. 

12Immediately upon the deceased referring to the little sister of the offender, she, to use her own words ""sort of blanked out"". In the opinion of a psychologist, which I accept, she entered into a dissociative state in which she was not fully aware of what she was doing. To use the language of the partial defence of provocation, she suffered a loss of self-control that I am satisfied was very profound. She picked up a piece of granite that was in the room for domestic purposes and struck the deceased to the head with it at least 30 times. Thereafter, she came to her senses to at least some degree, although she was still suffering from a loss of self-control. She did not do anything to assist the deceased who must have been by that stage very badly injured, if not close to death. Instead, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me, but probably included a desire to hide what she had done, some fear of retribution from the deceased, and an impulse to complete the violent assault that had commenced when she first lost self-control, the offender grabbed a knife and used it to stab the deceased to the throat three times. Two of the wounds were superficial, but one was over 12cm in depth and perforated the carotid artery of the deceased. 

13At that stage the offender did not reveal what she had done. Indeed it was quite some time before she left the room and told her then-boyfriend, who had been sleeping in a nearby room, what had happened. During the intervening period, she made a primitive attempt to clean up and to hide her acts. When she did confess to her boyfriend, and he insisted that the police be called, she was not keen for that to happen, and expressed a desire not to go to gaol. 

14Eventually police were called to the building and the offender was arrested. She chose to engage in an interview with police without the presence of a solicitor. During that interview she freely confessed her crime. The offender was charged with murder on that day, and has been in custody ever since. 

Objective seriousness of the offence

15The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum term of imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period attaching to the offence. That maximum penalty, combined with the fact that every offence of manslaughter involves the unlawful killing of a fellow human being, demonstrates the gravity of the crime to which the offender has pleaded guilty. 

16Turning to this particular offence, it is well known that, because the legal and factual bases upon which manslaughter may be made out are so varied, it is difficult to create some sort of hierarchy of seriousness. But at the least it can be said that, in this case, there was certainly an intention to kill, both during the attack with the piece of granite, and during the stabbing of the throat of the deceased. Two weapons were used. The offender treated the body of the deceased with callous disdain during her misguided attempt to hide her crime. The fatal ordeal of the deceased was brutal, painful, and terrifying. 

17On the other hand, it may be accepted that almost every member of our community recoils from the thought of child sexual assault, and reacts to it with anger and disgust. Even a person without the special sensitivities of the offender would have regarded the behaviour and words of the deceased as, at the least, offensive. The special sensitivity of the offender made the provocation to which she responded by losing self-control very powerful in its effect. 

18In short, bearing in mind the considerations discussed in R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141, and despite the gravity of the provocation in its effect on the offender, this particular manslaughter cannot be characterised as anything other than of considerable objective seriousness. 

19Having undertaken that analysis, I wish to emphasise that nothing I have said about what happened early on the morning of that day should be interpreted for a moment as suggesting that the deceased deserved to meet this violent death, or that the offender was in any way justified in what she did. In truth, if she was offended by what the deceased said to her in the car at Rushcutters Bay or in the flat at Potts Point, she should have put an end to the arrangement, left him in the car or ordered him out of the flat, and perhaps called the police with regard to what she saw on the laptop. As she herself said to the police after she was arrested, she had no right whatsoever to do what she did. 

Subjective features

20Although the plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter was accepted by the Crown on the day on which the trial was listed to commence, the offender had in fact offered to plead guilty to that offence very much earlier. Indeed, she had done so even before she was committed to this Court. Senior counsel for the offender submitted that a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea of guilty should be 25 per cent, and the Crown Prosecutor did not submit that such a discount was not open. Pursuant to what was said in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 and subsequent cases, I have discounted the sentence accordingly. 

21I am also satisfied that the offender is deeply remorseful for what she has done. I come to that view for a number of reasons. First, although it is true that on the morning of her crime she made an extended but rudimentary effort to hide her acts, I am satisfied that that was the result of panic and shock at what she had done. On the same morning, when the police did arrive, she was frank with them about her crime. Secondly, as I have said, she offered to plead guilty at a very early stage. Thirdly, she expressed her remorse to the psychologist, and he observed that at the time she did so she was sobbing. Fourthly, she gave evidence before me and in the presence of members of the family of the deceased as follows: 

""Q. You said to the police that you sort of blacked out?
A. I did and I am so sorry.

Q. What are you saying you're sorry about?
A. I feel so bad for what's happened and I can't change it. I'm so sorry for his family I'm so sorry.""

During that part of her evidence, and indeed during the majority of it, the offender was sobbing more or less uncontrollably. I by no means interpreted that as being solely referable to her own situation. Fifthly and finally, during the reading of the victim impact statement by Mr Potter's sister, I noted that the offender was crying in the dock as well. That was in sharp contrast to the behaviour of many offenders whom I have observed during that painful process in other proceedings on sentence. In short, for a plethora of reasons, I am satisfied that the offender deeply and bitterly regrets what she has done, and has come to understand the enormity of it. 

22The offender was born in October 1982. Accordingly, she was aged 27 as at the date of the offence, and as at today has just turned 30. Her background is hardly a privileged or happy one, quite apart from the crimes of which she was victim to which I have already referred. The offender was the product of a brief sexual encounter between her mother and father, and her mother was aged 15 when the offender was born. Her parents never married or lived together. She grew up in a family home with her mother and her stepfather and a number of stepbrothers and sisters. Her family changed residences frequently, the offender changed schools as a result, and she was not a good student. She had few friends, and was often suspended from school. Quite apart from the sexual abuse, her upbringing was characterised by other forms of violence, and the abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs by, at least, her stepfather. 

23The offender left school prior to Year 10 and left home at around the same time. She became a prostitute at the age of 18 years. By that stage she was already abusing alcohol, cannabis, MDMA, and amphetamines. By the age of 25, she was addicted to heroin. By the time of the offence, she had been a drug dependent street prostitute for many years, and I am prepared to infer that that state of affairs involved a great deal of degradation, poverty, and sadness. It is noteworthy that not a single person from outside of gaol, whether family member, romantic partner past or present, or friend or acquaintance, was prepared to come and give oral evidence in support of the offender, or even to write a reference in her favour. 

24Although I accept her longstanding drug problems, and despite the fact that she may have ingested some drugs in the afternoon and evening before, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender was affected by illicit drugs to any substantial degree as at the time of the offence.

25The psychologist who saw her a month or so ago diagnosed her as currently suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder arising from sexual and emotional abuse, a dependence on drugs, and anxiety and depression, and I accept those diagnoses. 

26The criminal record of the offender is virtually unblemished. It records her as having been fined in 2001 for having taken part in prostitution in a vehicle in February of that year, when the offender was only 18 years old. That offence is entirely consistent with the history provided to the psychologist, and which I have accepted. In 2009, she was convicted of having goods in custody with no penalty being imposed. Again, I regard such a matter as entirely consistent with the petty criminality that attaches to the life of a drug dependent prostitute working in Kings Cross. Her criminal record certainly entitles her to some leniency, and it is noteworthy that there is no hint of violence contained in it. 

Aggravating and mitigating factors

27I do not propose mechanistically to recount the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I trust that my findings as to the objective and subjective features of the matter sufficiently elucidate the aggravating and mitigating features that I have found to exist. I indicate that I have considered the written and oral submissions of both counsel on this issue. I have also referred myself to the section, whilst taking care to avoid the obvious danger of double-counting that exists in such a case. 

Prospects for the future

28As I have said, the offender was taken into custody on the day of the offence, and she has remained there until today. Her response has been generally very positive. She is free of illicit drugs and has received counselling with regard to avoiding a relapse in the future, she is being treated for depression, she has undertaken education in gaol, and she is keen to continue it by focussing on studies in business management or in real estate. It seems that whilst in custody she illicitly obtained a single tablet from another prisoner in a foolish attempt to deal with the stress of her court proceedings, but I do not regard that as greatly adverse in the circumstances. The chaplain of the prison in which she is being held has spoken very highly of her. All in all, her progress has been very promising, and bodes well for the future. 

29Having said that, it is noteworthy that the dissociative state in which the offender committed this crime was neither a unique event nor a new one. As I have recounted, she told the psychologist she would enter such a state when she was being sexually assaulted as a child. Not only that, when she spoke to the police on the morning of the offence, she said:

""Q132 
O.K. When you, when you say that you hit him repetitively, but you didn't know that you were doing it - - - 
A
I black out sometimes. I get so angry that I black out, and sometimes it's longer than others, but, and it's usually like just a few minutes or something.

Q133
And what happens when you black out?
A
I, like, for instance if you and I were having an argument, O.K. and something happened, just triggered me off, I sort of go blank and then I just attack like, I don't, I don't know what, why or what it is, but it's happened to me since I was a small kid. I don't know if it's like a defence mechanism or what, but - - -""

Furthermore, I note that, even whilst being interviewed by the psychologist, there was some suggestion of her entering such a state there and then. 

30This tragedy having occurred whereby the offender committed an act of fatal violence whilst in such a state, it seems to me imperative that that aspect of her personality be addressed to ensure that it does not happen again. Certainly, the evidence would not lead me to make an adverse finding as to future dangerousness as discussed in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 that could lead to a lengthening of the sentence. However, as I have said, in light of the fact that the offender has been prone to such states since she was a child; in light of the fact that, according to what she said to police, it has a connection with anger and arguments, and can lead to ""attack""; and in light of the fact that such a state on that morning had disastrous consequences, it seems to me that it is imperative that the offender be called upon to address it, both in custody and in the community. 

Comparative cases

31Although each case turns on its own facts, both counsel helpfully referred me to a number of decisions of this Court, both at first instance and in the Court of Criminal Appeal, specifically with regard to sentences for manslaughter founded on the partial defence of provocation. I have no doubt that sentences for manslaughter have increased to a substantial degree over the past 25 years, and sentences for manslaughter founded on provocation are not excluded from that phenomenon. I have had particular regard to the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Goundar v R [2012] NSWCCA 87 and Forrest v R [2009] NSWCCA 11, and the recent sentences imposed at first instance by Fullerton J in R v Won [2012] NSWSC 855 and McClellan CJ at CL in Singh v R [2012] NSWSC 637. 

Special circumstances

32Senior counsel for the offender has accepted that not only is a sentence of imprisonment inevitable, but also there must be some further time in custody pursuant to a non-parole period. However, she did submit that special circumstances exist that could permit a variation of the usual ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The Crown Prosecutor did not oppose such a finding with any force. I am satisfied that special circumstances exist, on the basis of the undoubted longstanding psychological problems of the offender, her need to deal in particular with a dependence upon drugs that has existed for many years, and the fact that, after she is released, it will be a very substantial adjustment for her not only to return to the community, but also to avoid her previous way of life. She will need a great deal of help in avoiding returning to the corner of William and Bourke Streets. In short, I propose to adjust the non-parole period to a small degree. 

Victim impact statement

33As part of the Crown case, Brendan Potter's sister, Ms Tammy Foy, read out a victim impact statement that she had prepared. That process starkly revealed the severe effects that the violent death of her brother had had upon her and their extended family. To lose any family member, even one who is old and frail, is a painful process. To lose one who is in the prime of life and who dies violently and suddenly at the hands of another is, I have no doubt, devastating. On behalf of the criminal justice system, I extend my condolences to those who are grieving, and will continue to grieve, the criminal loss of the life of Brendan Potter. It goes without saying, that nothing that can happen in this Court today will make good that loss, although the end of this process may provide some closure to those who are suffering. I have approached the victim impact statement in accordance with well-established principles of law: see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 

Aspects of sentence

34I wish to make three things clear both to the offender and the members of the community present about the sentence that I will impose in a moment. The first is that the sentence is substantially shorter than the one that would have been imposed if the offender had been convicted of murder as opposed to manslaughter. I trust that it is well understood that manslaughter, although a very serious offence, by its nature reflects a lesser culpability than the crime of murder, and has played that role for hundreds of years. The second is that the sentence has been reduced to reflect both the early offer to plead guilty of the offender and her remorse. The third is that her release will be by no means automatic at the end of the non-parole period that I impose. If she does not continue with the commendable progress she has made in custody, there is no guarantee of release before the entirety of the head sentence. 

Imposition of sentence

35Patricia Mary Butler, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to date from 31 July 2010 and expire on 30 January 2015. I impose a parole period of 2 years 6 months, to date from 31 January 2015 and expire on 30 July 2017. 

36Accordingly the head sentence is a period of imprisonment for 7 years to date from 31 July 2010, with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. I indicate that, but for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the head sentence would have been imprisonment for 9 years 4 months.

2760237,R v Hendra [2012] NSWDC 198,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Security guards at licensed premises are part of the solution to the problem of drunken violence, but, as the events which led to the conviction of the offender on a charge of assault have demonstrated, security guards can also be part of the problem. 

2Mr Nicholas Barsoum went to the Ivy one evening. No doubt he was hoping to have a good time. In the early hours of the following morning he was punched by an exgirlfriend. He did nothing to provoke this. Quite understandably he got cross and grabbed his exgirlfriend as she ran away. This led to the intervention of security guards. They told him to leave and escorted him out of the premises. Security camera footage showed what happened. Mr Barsoum remonstrated with the security guards, wagging his finger at them. One might be forgiven for thinking that most of us in his position might have done something similar. Mr Barsoum, I repeat, did nothing to provoke the attack upon him by his exgirlfriend. He was entitled to be at least disappointed at the situation which saw him being ejected from the Ivy in those circumstances. It is important to understand that there is no suggestion at all that Mr Barsoum was in any way violent towards those who were escorting him off the premises. Despite that, one of the security guards, probably a man by the name of Paul Fenukitau, punched him in the face as he was leaving. This was not captured on CCTV but no doubt it occurred. This punch caused a significant injury; it caused Mr Barsoum to be bleeding heavily from his lip, an injury which later required stitching in hospital. Mr Barsoum sent a text message to his friends. They assembled outside the Ivy and began walking towards the security guards, including the violent Mr Fenukitau, who were controlling access to the Ivy. The evidence of Mr Barsoum and his friends was that they wished merely to find out which security officer had hit Mr Barsoum and make a complaint.

3What happened thereafter is captured on closed circuit television. It is difficult to decide whether violence first came from the security guards or Mr Barsoum and his friends but given what happened to Mr Barsoum later it simply does not matter. Within a very short space of time the security guards had isolated Mr Barsoum. He was then set upon by a number of guards upstairs outside the Ivy where he was beaten savagely. He was kicked, he was punched and he was stomped on. Many people were passing by and many people gave evidence about what they saw. Two witnesses recorded footage on their mobile telephones. Unfortunately one of those witnesses accidentally deleted what she had recorded before it could be shown to police. But the jury and I saw the other footage. It showed significant violence being inflicted on a man who was held down and helpless. The distress on the part of the passersby who were watching this occur was obvious. It was appropriate. The conduct of staff from the Ivy, including people who were not charged, appeared to be concerned more with preventing passersby seeing the violence than stopping the violence. 

4I want to emphasise that this offender was not responsible for anything which occurred upstairs outside the Ivy. I mention these facts because of the condition Mr Barsoum was in when the security guards decided to take him downstairs so that he could be beaten further. (I have no doubt that that was the intention of at least some of the security guards who dragged Mr Barsoum downstairs.)

5A lot of witnesses gave evidence of seeing Mr Barsoum as he was taken from upstairs, where he had been beaten, through the doorway to the area downstairs. One of those witnesses described Mr Barsoum's face being swollen so that it resembled a balloon. I will quote at some length what he said, because it is important to know what Mr Barsoum looked like when Mr Hendra kicked him a little while later. This is what the witness said:

""His face was like, I've never seen anything like his face. He was just, I couldn't even see his eyes, like it was like somebody literally drew a line, like just a thick line on his face and that was his eyes. Like, he was just like a balloon. His face was like, blown up like a balloon and there was blood all over him. I couldn't even recognise what nationality he was, anything.""


6The CCTV footage taken from downstairs in the basement reveals a man who had been beaten so much he was barely able to sit upon a stool. He was covered in blood and had already been severely mistreated by the time Mr Hendra decided to get involved. So what did Mr Hendra then do to this helpless young man? The footage clearly showed the offender kicking him whilst he was seated on a stool. Mr Hendra kicked him once, apparently to his stomach or chest area. It is this kicking which forms the basis of the charge for which he must now be sentenced. Mr Barsoum was beaten by others as well after Mr Hendra kicked him and Mr Hendra, who was secondincharge of security that night, and nearby, did nothing to intervene.

7It was the evidence of Mr Hendra at his trial that he had been acting in self defence when he kicked Mr Barsoum. It was his evidence that as he approached Mr Barsoum to assess him for the purposes of firstaid, Mr Barsoum spat blood at him. The offender said that he reacted to defend himself against further similar actions by Mr Barsoum. 

8Not only do I, consistent with the jury's verdict, reject the idea that that kicking was in self defence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that if Mr Barsoum did spit blood it was only in response to one of the other security guards spitting at him, as Mr Hendra well knew had occurred. Mr Hendra was not acting in defence of himself or anyone else. He was an aggressor, a person who had lost his temper, at least partly because Mr Barsoum had had the temerity to become involved in a violent incident with Mr Fenukitau, an incident which had left Mr Fenukitau with a swollen eye. Mr Hendra had no thought of helping Mr Barsoum that night, he simply wanted to help his fellow security guards.

9Let me complete the story as regards Mr Barsoum. Having been hit by his exgirlfriend, having been ejected from the Ivy, having been punched by Mr Fenukitau on the way out, having been beaten by a gang of security guards upstairs and a gang of security guards downstairs, when the police arrived the security guards told police that Mr Barsoum was an offender and he found himself arrested. He did not have a good night. Fortunately it was not long before police realised their mistake and began arresting the real criminals, the security guards.

10It is important to remember that Mr Hendra was not responsible for many actions of other security guards that night. In particular, he was not involved in any of the violence upstairs nor was he acting as part of a joint criminal enterprise with any of the offenders downstairs. But in kicking a man who was already suffering from significant injuries is a very serious act of violence indeed. As I began these remarks on sentence, Mr Hendra was in an occupation where he should have been controlling violence for the benefit of others, not inflicting it for his own purposes.

11Part of the submissions today have addressed the issue as to the factual basis on which I should sentence Mr Hendra. Mr Hendra was found not guilty of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. Given the clear evidence that Mr Barsoum had suffered actual bodily harm downstairs I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hendra was in company when he inflicted the violence that he is responsible for on Mr Barsoum. But that does not mean that I should ignore what occurred afterwards. Mr Hendra, as I said, was second in charge that night. Having kicked Mr Barsoum, no feelings of remorse came upon him. He did not do a single thing as Mr Barsoum was savagely beaten again. He looked after Mr Fenukitau and Mr Vacic, ignoring what was happening to Mr Barsoum a short distance away. 

12This lack of remorse has continued to this day. Indeed, Mr Hendra's attitude towards his criminality is, I have to say, remarkable. He sees himself, it appears, as the victim in this matter. He said to a psychologist that the case was a political one and not treated as a normal incident. He questioned whether the police officer in charge of the case had political allies and was being primed for bigger things. He accurately told the author of the presentence report that he felt no remorse. This, as I said, is remarkable. Mr Hendra committed a very serious crime, one he simply fails to acknowledge. 

13Mr Hendra was born in New Zealand. He is now thirty five years of age. His upbringing was difficult, at least from the age of about eleven, when his father began to become increasingly violent towards him. Things got so bad that he left home at the age of fifteen, specifically to get away from his father's violence. He retains the support of his mother who is currently in the process of divorcing his father. He has no contact with his father. He is in a relationship with a young woman who supports him and, he has had other relationships in the past. 

14He left school about the age of seventeen and has being an industrious worker since then. He began working as a fisherman, then qualified as a personal trainer, work which led him eventually to act as a security guard. 

15A number of testimonials were tendered to me today and they all speak very highly of the offender. These are people who know the offender well and they all describe the actions of the offender as being out of character. At trial Mr Hendra gave evidence of the work that he had done and his ability to diffuse potentially violent situations without resorting to violence. The testimonials also speak about the offender's good works, particularly at the time of the Brisbane floods of 2011 when the offender gave up his own time and organised other people to drive to Queensland and assist people who had been harmed through the floods. There is obviously much that the offender is entitled to be proud of. 

16He has no criminal convictions, and it is one matter to get to the age of sixteen or seventeen without committing a crime but the fact that the offender is now being dealt with for his first offence at the age of thirty five says a lot about his underlying good character. It makes his decision to commit this offence and the lack of remorse for it even more puzzling.

17Of course, a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the offender's conduct is required. It was a single blow but the video evidence showed that it was a significant one and as I have repeatedly said, it was a blow inflicted on a man who was already exhibiting the signs of terrible injuries. To say that Mr Barsoum was defenceless is an understatement. Of course there is no evidence that the kick, for which Mr Hendra was responsible, caused any actual injury, something that Mr Thomas who appears for the offender today relies on. It is, however, not a matter of mitigation that the more serious offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was not committed. 

18Of course this offence was not planned, at least as far as Mr Hendra was concerned. He did not go to work that evening planning on inflicting violence upon someone and his decision to kick Mr Barsoum appears to have been made only fairly shortly before he inflicted the blow. 

19The question concerning the likelihood that Mr Hendra will commit offences in the future is not an easy one to determine. In the absence of a plea of guilty and in the absence of any expression of remorse, there is something to be said for the proposition that there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Hendra will act any differently should a similar situation arise in the future. However, I am not going to sentence the offender on that basis. The sentence I am about to impose will act as a personal deterrent to him and in any case it is clear that Mr Hendra will be unable to work as a security guard in the future.

20Sentences of imprisonment are very much sentences of last resort and whilst sentences for common assault rarely involve full time custody, the maximum penalty reserved for a case in a worst category of offending does involve imprisonment. This is one of the worst types of common assault that it is possible to contemplate. I trust that it is not necessary for me to repeat again the circumstances of this offending in order to explain why it is that I have made that finding.

21I am satisfied that a fulltime custodial sentence is required. This will be the offender's first time in prison and so I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour.

22The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months to date from today, 26 October 2012. It will expire on 25 July 2013. I set a period of eligibility for parole of nine months, making a head sentence of eighteen months. The offender is to be released to parole on 25 July 2013.

2760246,R v Fazah [2012] NSWSC 1243,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The accused, Mr Farden Fazah, was arrested on 1 January 2011 and has remained in custody since.  He has been committed to stand trial in this Court on an indictment alleging that he murdered his child and wounded his wife with intent to murder her.  There is an alternative count that he wounded his wife with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm.
2There is a question as to Mr Fazah's fitness to be tried.  That is an issue which is to be determined on the balance of probabilities by the application of the well-known Presser criteria.
3Yesterday and today I have heard and received evidence and submissions concerning this question.
4The Crown relies upon the evidence of Dr Rosalie Wilcox.  She has prepared two reports, dated 16 April 2012 and 1 October 2012.  Annexed to those reports are extensive collections of documents.  I would not do justice to Dr Wilcox if I were to attempt to summarise those reports; they need to be read in full to appreciate the foundation for her ultimate opinion which is that Mr Fazah is fit to be tried.
5A critical aspect of Dr Wilcox' consideration of the issue is the question of whether Mr Fazah is malingering.  Broadly speaking, she has concluded that he is feigning a lack of memory and also feigning mental illness.
6Dr Wilcox was cross-examined yesterday by Mr Winch, counsel for Mr Fazah.  He took her to a number of individual matters which, cumulatively have led Dr Wilcox to her ultimate conclusion.  In respect of a number of those matters, Mr Winch successfully obtained concessions that there was an alternative view that could be taken, or that when seen in the context of other material that Dr Wilcox had not originally taken into account, the matter did not carry the weight that she had at first considered.
7I will cite one example of this.  Within the documents Dr Wilcox reviewed there is a transcript of covertly recorded conversations Mr Fazah had with members of his family on the evening of 7 January 2011 (tab 5 in Exhibit A).  They included a male person saying to him ""You don't remember your state of mind"" and ""you don't know what happened, right"". 
8Dr Wilcox considered that ""it is not uncommon due to the level of arousal or due to dissociation at the time of an offence for someone to later have difficulty recalling aspects of the offence"".  But she noted that ""the period of memory loss is usually quite discrete and there is a clear recollection of preceding events and subsequent events"".  Mr Fazah, however, has claimed a far more extensive lack of memory.  It was Dr Wilcox' view that his reported memory loss does not conform to any known condition.  She did not believe that it was indicative of dissociation.  She thought the ""most obvious reason is that his family told him to act as if he had no recollection of the event"".
9Mr Winch took Dr Wilcox to the statement of Detective Senior Constable Aaron Turner of 25 January 2011 (tab 3 in Exhibit A).  It records an interview with Mr Fazah on 7 January 2011 from 6.01pm to 6.50pm.  It occurred in a hospital setting.  Mr Fazah had been held in police custody in a hospital since his arrest due to him having suffered what are alleged to have been self-inflicted stab wounds.  He responded to many questions by saying he either did not understand or he could not recall.  On a number of occasions he asked to see his family. Further, on a number of occasions he mumbled things that the officer could not understand.  On one occasion he touched his forehead and said, ""In here something wrong"". 
10The covertly recorded conversation with family members, one of the matters relied upon by Dr Wilcox as supporting her opinion, occurred subsequent to this police interview.  When this was drawn to her attention, she offered that because Mr Fazah had been in hospital since his arrest there had been plenty of time for him to have been visited by his family prior to 7 January; implicitly suggesting that the advice to feign a lack of memory had been given prior to the police interview.  However, Mr Winch then drew attention to a portion of the interview (p. 17 of Detective Turner's statement) where it is recorded that the detective indicated that Mr Fazah had not been visited by any family since his arrest. 
11Clearly, the lack of memory claimed by Mr Fazah did not originate with a suggestion from his family.  That is not to say that it is genuine, or otherwise.  It simply serves as an example of a number of matters relied upon by Dr Wilcox that, when more closely examined, do not support at all, or do not support as much, her ultimate conclusion.
12This is not to say that I do not accept Dr Wilcox' opinion that the accused is malingering.  My view is that he probably is.  The extent to which that is so is not possible to be precise about.  However, it does not necessarily follow that he is in fact fit to be tried.
13Dr Wilcox relied upon evidence concerning the accused's life prior to coming into custody.  This included matters such as the fact that he had partially completed a university course in Kabul before he came to Australia.  In Australia he had employment as a security guard.  In the latter context there was evidence that his command of English was far better than he has made out since coming into custody.  Generally, the evidence was inconsistent with him having any previous mental health issues aside from some rather difficult to understand evidence concerning an event which occurred in Afghanistan when he was 14 years of age.
14At the conclusion of her second report, Dr Wilcox said:
He is an intelligent man and I believe that he has the capacity to not only feign memory impairment but to also fabricate mental illness to avoid taking responsibility for his actions.  Therefore based on these conclusions it is my opinion that on the balance of probabilities he is fit to be tried and fulfils the criteria for fitness as specified in R v Presser (1958) as detailed below:
I believe he understands that he is charged with the murder of his daughter (Maria Fazah) and the stabbing of his wife, Rasa Fazah, with the intent to murder her;I believe he is able to plead to the charge and to exercise his rights of challenge;There is no indication that he does not understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charge with;I believe he is able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense;There is no indication that he is unable to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him;I believe that he is able to give any necessary instructions to his counsel and to let his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary tell the court what it is;I believe he has sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and counsel.
15At the conclusion of her evidence I asked her:
Q.  Doctor, can I ask you something about your ultimate opinion.  Which of these two would best reflect what your opinion is:  I'm not satisfied that he is unfit to be tried, therefore he is fit to be tried; or, I'm not satisfied that he is unfit to be tried, therefore, based upon the objective evidence as to what he was like and how he was able to function in the community before going into custody, he should have the mental capacity to be fit to be tried? A.  I suppose the second one.  
Q.  So it's not a case so much of you being affirmatively satisfied he is fit, but you are affirmatively satisfied that he should be fit? A.  Yes, yes.  (15.10.12 at T31)
16The defence relied upon the evidence of Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Katie Seidler.  Reports by Dr Nielssen of 29 November 2011 and 11 October 2012 (Exhibits 1 and 2) and reports by Dr Seidler of 20 August and 17 September 2012 (Exhibits 3 and 4) were tendered.  In addition, there was an affidavit by the accused's solicitor, Ms Amanda Coultas-Roberts (Exhibit 5).
17A very useful comparison of the opinions of the three doctors prepared by the Crown Prosecutor was also tendered (Exhibit C). 
18Ms Coultas-Roberts' affidavit sets out the difficulties she has experienced in explaining the legal process to Mr Fazah since the time she commenced to act for him in February 2011.  She has experienced significant difficulties in obtaining instructions from him.  He seems to be preoccupied in obtaining treatment for his mental health condition; certainly more so than he is interested in assisting Ms Coultas-Roberts to act for him in relation to the charges.
19Dr Nielssen's second report includes his consideration of the opinion of Dr Wilcox (her first report).  He accepts that ""it ... seems likely that Mr Fazah is exaggerating his intellectual impairment and mental illness"".  However, Dr Nielssen remains of the view that a provisional diagnosis was one of probable schizophrenic illness.  He remains of the view that Mr Fazah is unfit to be tried ""as he was again unable to demonstrate that he understood the general nature of the proceedings, how a trial was conducted, that he could follow the proceedings in a general sense, or that he could provide coherent instructions"".
20I note that Dr Nielssen, like Dr Wilcox, took into account the circumstances of the accused's life prior to when he came into custody.
21Dr Seidler's second report includes her consideration of the first reports by Drs Wilcox and Nielssen.  In her first report she opined that Mr Fazah was ""impaired and disordered and in [her] opinion, unfit for the Court process"".  After considering the reports of Drs Wilcox and Nielssen she remained of that view.  She allowed for the possibility that Mr Fazah was ""feigning or exaggerating his illness/condition"".  She did not, however, believe that his presentation was ""completely malingered"".  She concluded her second report with the following explanation for that opinion:
""That is, there is a history in Afghanistan of psychological, behavioural and/or cognitive concerns for Mr. Fazah.  He was then subject to extreme deprivation and torture whilst imprisoned by the Taliban and this, no doubt, further compromised Mr. Fazah's functioning, leaving him a vulnerable and disordered individual.  He coped poorly in transitioning to life in this country and was clearly very reliant on his family.  I accept that Mr. Fazah was violent, aggressive and abusive towards his wife and like Dr. Wilcox, understand the alleged offences within the context of this.  However, I believe that even so, Mr. Fazah was traumatised by the death of his daughter and attempted murder of his wife, which has had a devastating impact on his functioning and to some extent, explains his presentation since that time.  However, given Mr. Fazah's reliance on his family and relative naivety about life in this country, I also accept that it is likely that he has taken the instruction of his family on board and has, to some extent, exaggerated his condition.  Therefore, the answer to this case is seemingly a complex one that reflects both genuine and severe illness and functional disturbance on the basis of a history of probable genetic disorder/vulnerability coupled with unsophisticated exaggeration as a function of naïve reliance on family members that has resulted in Mr. Fazah taking on board their instruction to act as if he does not remember what occurred on the occasion of the alleged offences.  Nonetheless, I do believe that Mr. Fazah is a disturbed, dysfunctional and disordered individual, who copes poorly on a daily basis, is highly traumatised and naïve to the ways of society here that would enable him to participate meaningfully in his defence rendering him unfit"".
22I have found this a rather difficult matter.  In the end, I consider that it is of some significance that Dr Wilcox was unable to affirmatively establish that the accused is fit to be tried.  Her opinion is really to the effect that she was not satisfied that he was unfit, and therefore he should be fit.  Drs Nielssen and Seidler have taken into account that there is an element of malingering involved in the accused's presentation.  Nevertheless, their evidence supports a conclusion of unfitness.
23I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to be tried.
24In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act), I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
25The accused is remanded in custody until the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 16 of the Act be given effect to.
26I direct the court registry to provide the following documentation to the Tribunal within 14 days:

		16 October 2012",2012-10-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760249,R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The respondent, Andrew Robert Windle, was convicted and sentenced for an offence committed on 1 January 2011 of attempting to strangle a fellow inmate at Long Bay Gaol with intent to murder.  He was sentenced to a term of four years and six months, with a non-parole period of two years and six months.  The sentence was fixed to commence on 29 October 2011.
2The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
3The offending falls within a category of conduct which the Parliament has characterised as warranting severe punishment, as demonstrated by the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 10 years.  The circumstances of the offending warranted, in an objective sense, a far heavier penalty than that imposed by the sentencing judge.  However, the mental condition of the offender required serious attention to be given to a lesser sentence than that otherwise warranted, a factor which weighed heavily with the sentencing judge.  While the sentencing judge clearly exposed his reasons for the sentence imposed, in the final analysis the sentence was outside a legitimate range and must be increased.  I would propose a sentence of five years and four months with a non-parole period of four years.
Circumstances of offending4The circumstances of the offending were briefly but sufficiently outlined by Garling DCJ in his judgment on sentence (pp 1-2).  Both the offender and the victim were inmates at Long Bay Correctional Centre, the victim being 39 years of age.  Both were in the shower area, where they had a short and unremarkable conversation.  The victim turned his back on the offender to check the temperature of the water, at which point the offender put a sock around his neck pulling it tight so that he could neither get the sock away from his throat, nor, ultimately, breathe.  The victim lost consciousness and fell to the floor.  When he regained consciousness he called for help from another inmate who in turn brought a prison officer to his aid.
5When both inmates were locked in their respective cells, the offender called out to the victim asking whether he was ""still going to charge"" the offender.  When the victim said yes, the offender asked why.  The victim replied ""because you haven't even apologised yet.  Why did you do it?"".  The offender answered ""I don't know"".
6The statement of facts prepared by the Director continued:
""On the morning of 2 January 2011, senior Corrective Services Officers spoke with Windle.  Windle indicated that he had followed [the victim] into the shower area and then, after [the victim] undressed, he (Windle) put a sock around [the victim's] neck and tried to kill him.  Windle indicated that he did not know why he did it, he 'just had to do it'.  Windle indicated that he stopped strangling [the victim] because he thought [the victim] was dead.  Windle indicated that he continued to strangle [the victim] when [the victim] collapsed to the ground.  He continued to strangle [the victim] while [the victim] was on the ground, then [the victim] 'shook a bit' then 'urinated himself'.  Windle indicated that he then thought [the victim] was dead so he walked out of the shower area with the sock, put the sock on a nearby shelf with other clothes, and then began to 'walk laps outside'.""
7Even though the expressed intention was not fulfilled, strangling a person to a state of unconsciousness is capable of producing serious and permanent consequences, such as brain damage resulting from loss of oxygen.  That did not happen in the present case.  As the statement of facts reported:
""As a result of the incident, [the victim] had a sore throat and neck.  He had a red mark on his throat where the sock had been.  Two days after the incident, he still felt pain when swallowing.""
8In addition to frankly stating his intention to Corrective Services officers, the offender also pleaded guilty to the offence at the first reasonable opportunity.
Judgment on sentence9The sentencing exercise involved four discrete elements, namely:
(a) determining the appropriate sentence by way of a ""starting point"", subject to any discount;(b) evaluating the guilty plea and allowing a discount of 25% on that account;(c) identifying that there were ""special circumstances"" allowing departure from the statutory relationship between non-parole period and balance of sentence, and(d) identifying the commencement date of the sentence.
10The starting point of the sentence, after an assessment of a range of factors which will be discussed below, was identified as six years.  The 25% discount for the early guilty plea resulted in a term of imprisonment of 4.5 years.  The variation of the proportion for the non-parole period, pursuant to the finding of special circumstances, allowed for a non-parole period of 2.5 years, giving a balance of term being 80% of the non-parole period, the required proportion being no greater than 33.3% in the absence of special circumstances: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 44(2).  
Issues on appeal11The grounds of appeal identified by counsel for the Director focused upon the first stage of assessing the overall sentence: grounds 1-4 and 6.  In addition, there was a challenge to the finding of special circumstances: ground 5.  Because, in both respects, the appeal should be upheld, it will be necessary for this Court to resentence the offender.  For that purpose, it will also be necessary to identify the appropriate date for the commencement of the sentence.  As it was not challenged on appeal, it is convenient to note first why the date adopted by the sentencing judge should be accepted.
(a) date of commencement of sentence12The sentencing judge directed that the sentence commence on 29 October 2011.  That date was not selected arbitrarily: the offender was, at the time of sentencing, serving a term of four years imprisonment dating from 30 April 2009 and expiring on 29 April 2013.  The sentence was subject to a non-parole period of 18 months which expired on 29 October 2010.  That date was before the date of the offending and he was therefore serving his parole period at the time of the offence and, indeed, at the time of sentencing (on 15 December 2011).  The sentencing judge noted that the offender ""was not released to parole and the next available date for him to have consideration for parole was 29 October 2011"": judgment, p 6.  He therefore concluded that the appropriate date for the commencement of the further sentence was the date when the offender could have been further considered for parole, albeit a date two months before the date of sentencing.
13Generally, a sentence will commence on the date on which it is imposed, subject to certain exceptions, not relevant for present purposes, and subject to any direction otherwise: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 47.  The Court may direct that a sentence be taken to have commenced on an earlier day (sub-s (2)(a)) or on a later day (sub-s (2)(b)).  In backdating a sentence, the Court is required to take into account ""any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence"": sub-s (3) and s 24(a). 
14Both ss 24 and 47(3) thus impose an obligation on the Court to take into account any period for which the offender has been held in custody ""in relation to the offence"" for which sentence is being imposed.  There has been no clear opinion expressed in the case law as to whether the phrase ""in relation to"" is limited to custody referrable solely to the new offence and whether custody is referrable solely to the new offence in circumstances where parole was revoked because the person was charged with or convicted of the new offence.
15It may seem curious that the scope of a mandatory obligation should be unclear and unresolved.  There are, however, two factors which explain why that is so.  The first is a legal consideration, namely that, although such custody must be taken into account, the Sentencing Procedure Act does not specify how it should be taken into account.  Case law demonstrates that there is no fixed rule as to how it is to be taken into account: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 (Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing).  The second factor which partly explains the established practice, is that circumstances may differ and the Court may not have precise information as to the circumstances in a particular case.  For example, if a person were held in custody following arrest, it might be necessary to consider whether the arrest was solely in respect of the offence for which the person was being sentenced, or whether there were other offences involved.  Similarly, where parole has been revoked, the court may not know whether it was revoked solely because of the further offence, or for that and other reasons, or for entirely separate reasons.
16The sentencing judge did not explain why he backdated the sentence to the point at which parole was presumably (whether it occurred or not was not noted by the sentencing judge) first considered after the fresh offending.  There was no necessary error in taking such a course and, as neither party sought to challenge the approach taken, this Court should adopt the same commencement date in resentencing.  
(b) discount for guilty plea17The Court should also adopt the discount of 25% for the early guilty plea, which was manifestly correct.
(c) whether sentence manifestly inadequate18The question of the inadequacy of the sentence and the challenge to the finding of special circumstances involved consideration of similar factors.  It is convenient to deal with the substance of the challenge to the inadequacy of sentence first.
19The primary judge noted and took into account the following considerations which were directly relevant to determining the starting point for the sentence calculation:
(a) the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period (judgment, pp 3-4);(b) the fact that a severe deterrent sentence was appropriate for crimes of violence committed whilst in custody (p 4);(c) the significant criminal record of the offender acquired over some five years between the ages of 17 and 22, including break and enter, assault, assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty and the specially aggravated offence of entering a dwelling with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, committed in April 2009 (pp 2-3).
20In considering the nature of the offence and the manner in which it might be dealt with on sentencing, his Honour had regard to the reasons given in R v Bell [2005] NSWCCA 81 and Munn v R [2009] NSWCCA 218: judgment, p 6.  All of these considerations supported a sentence well in excess of that imposed.  There were two critical countervailing factors, namely:
(a) the mental illness of the offender, and(b) the voluntary disclosure of the offending and, in particular, the intent with which the assault was carried out.
21It is the factors favouring a lower sentence which require careful consideration.  
(d) mental illness22The Director did not submit that the offender was not suffering from a serious mental illness, nor that that was not an appropriate consideration to be taken into account.  Although the Court was referred to the remarks of Spigelman CJ in R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 at [22], to the effect that some mental conditions, whilst qualifying as psychiatric illnesses, might not justify less weight being given to general deterrence, it was not suggested that the mental condition suffered by the offender fell into such a category.  Alternatively, if that inference were intended, it should not be accepted.
23The sentencing judge had before him a report of a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, dated 8 May 2011.  It is clear that he accepted Dr Furst's opinions.
24Dr Furst knew the offender from an earlier assessment in June 2009.  Dr Furst was asked to consider whether he thought that Mr Windle was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the 2011 offence.  He concluded:
""Your client has a history of severe personality disturbance; however I did not think that the intrusive thoughts he harboured at the time of the alleged offence were driven by defect of reason or were the product of a disease of the mind.  He does not appear to have the mental illness defence available to him.""
25Dr Furst was also asked to advise as to fitness to plead.  Again, he concluded that the offender was fit to plead and to stand trial.
26More generally, Dr Furst noted that Mr Windle was 21 years of age, and had been in custody in a number of correctional centres since his arrest in 2009.  He had had an unfortunate childhood, not knowing his biological father, and having witnessed and been exposed to frequent domestic violence at the hands of a de facto father.  He had left school in Year 8 at 13 years of age and was in trouble with police from the age of 15.  Mr Windle was diagnosed with depression in 2005 whilst in juvenile detention and developed a paranoid psychotic illness in 2007, with symptoms of paranoia that lasted for about three-six months.
27In January 2009 he reported having ""unusual thoughts in his head"" and decided to cut off part of his ear.  He cut off part of the other ear about two months later.  Dr Furst further reported:
""When assessed in 2009, he told me that he often felt depressed, did not feel like talking to anyone, was isolative, slept 'on and off', and had mood swings.  ...  He also told me that he has ongoing thoughts of hurting himself, however he has nothing to harm himself with and said 'I can't do it because they're watching me.'
He said that his tendency to self-harm continued, including cutting parts of his ear off between October and November 2009.  He also had urges to harm his cell mate at Junee in February 2010, telling me that he cut the leg of his cell mate with a razor blade whilst he was asleep on the floor.  Mr Windle said, 'I can't explain it.  I don't hear voices or get messages ... the thought comes in, like 'I've got to hurt this guy'.""
28In April 2010, he cut his nipple off and later cut his finger ""by accident"".  In December 2010 he cut his penis causing a severe loss of blood.  The event was treated as an attempted suicide.
29His account to Dr Furst of the 2011 offence commenced with him ""walking up and down and doing laps of the yard"".  Dr Furst's report continued:
""He denied hearing voices but described having an intrusive thought, 'I want to strangle this bloke,' in relation to the alleged victim ....  He said, 'It was like I couldn't control it ... I didn't think about the consequences.'  He denied having an argument with [the victim] before the incident, stating 'I was just getting on with my day ... it just came into my mind.  It's like I get stuck on the thought ... I had to do it.'  
He told me that after the act in question he came out of the shower area and did not think about what he had done, feeling 'calm' and 'relaxed' and asking for a cigarette.  He denied feeling distressed.  Mr Windle said that he had no recollection of hearing voices, denied thoughts that the victim was going to harm him, and had no particular disturbance in his mood that day.  He denied feeling angry.  He acknowledged acting on impulse.""
30Dr Furst's conclusions in respect of his psychological state were as follows:
""Mr Windle presents as a 21-year-old male from a troubled and unstable family of origin who had an early onset of drug use and emotional problems.  He seems to have limited intellect, poor coping skills, and an inability to self-regulate his emotional state.  His depressive symptoms are more consistent with a Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder than those often seen in Major Depressive Disorder, however given the history so far, including his period of psychosis in 2007 and his extended period of substance abuse, he should be regarded [as] at a substantially higher risk of developing a major mental illness ... such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in the future.
It would appear that his offending behaviour was the product of an irresistible impulse to kill the inmate in question for no obvious reason apart from his own disturbed and grossly dysfunctional thinking.  There was a compulsive quality to his actions, a lack of affective disturbance, and an apparent indifference to his actions in the period immediately after the alleged offence.  In my opinion, this is of great concern in terms of the risks he poses to other inmates in the criminal justice system and people in the wider community upon his eventual release.  He is also at high risk to himself, especially given his previous suicide attempts with high potential lethality and serious intent.""
31Dr Furst also noted that the offender had been held in a single camera cell for much of his earlier incarceration and had been in the Acute Crisis Management Unit of Long Bay following the offence.  For the first four months of 2011 (and probably continuing) he had been placed on a segregation order within the unit, meaning that he was largely unable to associate with the other inmates.  
32The report indicated that Mr Windle had been treated with Fluoxetine (an anti-depressant medication) and several anti-psychotic drugs since 2009.  He remained on a similar regime after the current offending.  Although Dr Furst was of the view that he was not psychotic at the time of the offence, he did not criticise the drug regime and appears to have accepted that there may have been other brief psychotic episodes during his incarceration.  (The Justice Health medical records from which the inferences were drawn were not available to this Court.)
33Dr Furst's conclusions suggest that the long term prognosis is not good and noted that, whilst in the community, he had been unable to resist the on-going use of amphetamines ""despite negative effects on his mental health, clear legal sanctions and efforts to rehabilitate him through the Youth Drug Court Program.""
34Dr Furst was unable to provide any explanation, rational or emotional, for the attack, which can only be explained as a consequence of his psychiatric condition, albeit that condition was not such as to establish a defence of insanity.
(e) leniency - undiscovered offence35The trial judge noted that the offender was ""entitled to what is commonly referred to as an Ellis discount"": judgment, p 4.  The label ""Ellis discount"" derives from the case in which the principle was stated.  The sentencing judge rightly, if implicitly, dismissed the label and applied the principle.  That is to say, he did not reach a particular starting point and apply a discount, but merely took the principle into account as a basis upon which to accord a degree of leniency.  In R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, Street CJ stated at 604D:
""When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision.  Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge.  It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.
The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing.  Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.""
36An important aspect of Ellis is the distinction between a plea of guilty to a charge which has been laid and disclosure to the police of the fact of the offence, or at least the offender's involvement therein.  Significantly for present purposes, the voluntary disclosure might include:
(a) revelation of an offence not known to the authorities;(b) revelation of the identity of the offender, or(c) revelation of an aspect of the offending not known to the authorities.
In the present case, the victim had reported the offence and the identity of the offender.  It was only the element of intention which, without the offender's confession, might not have been capable of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The extent of the appropriate element of leniency must depend on the extent of the voluntary revelation.
37In Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 all members of the High Court accepted the principle identified in Ellis, described by McHugh J at [15] as ""a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account"".  His Honour continued:
""It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process.  How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.""
38In the present case, the sentencing judge accepted that he had ""only been charged with this offence because of admissions ... that he intended to kill the victim"".  Absent the admission, he would have faced a serious assault charge, but no more, because the victim recovered quite quickly: judgment, p 4.
39In Ryan, Callinan J considered the degree of lenience accorded on this basis could helpfully be stated without interfering with ""the intuitive process that sentencing involves"": at [185].  Such an approach would be consistent with transparency, but is usually eschewed on the basis that a numerical discount may itself be misleading, because it gives an incorrect impression of precision and may, over time, lead to the development of a practice or rule requiring a particular level of discounting.
40In any event, the sentencing judge did not give any numerical indication as to the degree of leniency which he accorded.  The Director did not criticise the sentencing judgment in that respect, but submitted that there was an element of excessive allowance because of the proposed sentence (prior to discount for the guilty plea) of six years.
(f) relevance of mental illness41It is a well established principle that an established mental illness which affects the decision-making capacity of the individual offender is significant because it diminishes the importance of key elements of the sentencing exercise.  For example, it may demonstrate that the offender had little control over his impulses or actions, due to a condition for which he was not in any relevant sense responsible.  Assuming it to be an on-going condition, the importance of personal deterrence may be much reduced.  By the same token, punishment of a person not in full control of his or her conduct may form a poor vehicle for promoting general deterrence.  Even in jurisdictions which retain the death penalty, the execution of the mentally ill or intellectually disabled might be thought, at least by our standards, to demean the law rather than promote acceptance and compliance.  
42In Ryan, McHugh J identified a significant sentencing principle as retribution, ""a notion that reflects the community's expectation that the offender will suffer punishment and that particular offences will merit severe punishment"": at [46].  However, a proper purpose of the criminal law is not to give effect to the irrational prejudices of ill-informed public opinion.  The urge for retribution is, or should be, treated as diminished in the case of the mentally ill.
43The factor which merits consideration in the present case is the appropriate protection of society.  This issue was considered in detail in the seminal judgments in Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465, eg at 476-478.  Mr Veen had a record of homicidal violence.  Hunt J sentenced him to life imprisonment for a second homicide, he having entered a plea of guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, on the basis of brain damage due to alcohol abuse.  In custody, and without access to alcohol, he appears to have been a calm and unthreatening person.  However, the sentencing judge, having found that a life sentence was proportionate to the gravity of the offence, imposed such a sentence, giving weight to the protection of the community.  The High Court divided as to the propriety of that approach, the majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) dismissing the appeal.  Their Honours noted at 476:
""There is an anomaly, however, in the way in which the mental abnormality which would make an offender a danger if he were at large is regarded when it reduces the crime of murder to manslaughter pursuant to s 23A [of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)].  Prima facie, a mental abnormality which exonerates an offender from liability to conviction for a more serious offence is regarded as a mitigating circumstance affecting the appropriate level of punishment.  ...
However, sentencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment.  The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform.  The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case.  They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.  And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter.  These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality. In Veen [No 1] Murphy J alone thought it 'a distortion of the criminal law to sentence people to longer terms because they ... have diminished responsibility'.  As Baroness Wootton points out, if that approach were adopted in culpable homicide the legally insane would be detained indefinitely, those whose responsibility was severely diminished would be released in the shortest time even though they were a grave danger to society, and those whose responsibility was diminished to a lesser extent would be longest detained even though their release would pose little danger to society.  Such a theory of sentencing would prove adventitious in practice and destructive of public confidence in the processes of criminal justice.""
44The anomalies identified by Baroness Wootton (in ""Diminished Responsibility: A Layman's View"" (1960) 76 LQR 224) arise from the use of criminal punishment to protect society from those whose mental illness renders them a danger.  Arguably, that function should be left to laws addressing mental illness.  As noted by Deane J (in dissent with Wilson J and Gaudron J) the problem of those who are mentally ill and dangerous but not legally insane should be addressed by a system of preventative restraint, not by misuse of notions of criminal punishment: at 495.  Wilson J, with whom Deane J and Gaudron J agreed, stated at 488:
""A sentence cannot represent appropriate punishment for the particular offence if by reason of a concern to protect the community it exceeds that sentence which is the maximum the circumstances of the offence, viewed objectively, will bear.  However, later in his judgment [in Channon v R (1978) 20 ALR 1 at p 21] Deane J ... accepted that the protection of the public from an offender with a propensity to commit violent or serious crime may legitimately result in a heavier sentence being imposed than would be the case if such propensity had not been present.  With all respect, I find an ambiguity in such a statement because if the propensity had not been present then it is probable that considerations personal to the offender would justify a measure of leniency and result in a sentence which was less than the maximum punishment which the facts of the offence, viewed objectively, would warrant.""
45In Veen [No 2] Deane J also noted that a propensity to commit serious offences in the future and the protection of the public could preclude any reduction of the full sentence which is proportionate to the facts of the actual crime, but cannot increase that sentence: at 491.  He continued:
""Otherwise, the sentence imposed would conceal two elements: the sentence appropriate to the crime if unmitigated by other factors and a further sentence which, while worded in the language of punishment, is not justified by reference to the gravity of the actual offence but is in fact imposed to procure the protection of the public by the preventive detention of the offender.""
46Arguably, the ambiguity identified by Wilson J remains in the further comments of Deane J and in the reasoning of the majority.  The ambiguity lies in the failure to identify whether the yardstick within which an element of preventative detention can operate (identified as the legitimate purpose of protection of the public), namely the greatest sentence which can be imposed ""proportionate to the gravity of the offence"", includes the element of mental illness.  If it does, and it is difficult to see how it cannot in a case where the mental illness constitutes an element of the offence (in the concept of diminished responsibility), it would be difficult to take the mental illness (now described as a propensity to commit crime) into account in a manner which is set off against the diminished moral culpability, without the sentence being increased beyond the limit imposed by the yardstick of proportionality.  On the other hand, if mental illness is removed from the calculation of proportionality, a critical element central to the assessment of moral culpability is ignored.  When reintroduced, it is offset by the protective element.
47Reliance on a lack of pure logic is to risk unprincipled sentencing.  On one view, Veen [No 2] invites a two stage process to sentencing the dangerously mentally ill.  Whether that is consistent with the reasoning in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 is not entirely clear.  However, to place all the elements into the balance at once is to risk giving effect to a level of preventative detention so as to exceed the appropriate sentence for the offence.
48It may be that a ""pragmatic"" approach to such issues will provide the best practical results.  However, it does so at the potential cost of treating the mentally ill and intellectually disabled as fully responsible and thus warranting punishment to an extent which would otherwise be thought incompatible with the modern understanding of mental illness and intellectual disability.
49This dilemma is acute in the present case: there is no doubt that the offender will be returned to the community within a matter of years, unless a grossly disproportionate sentence is imposed.  Whether the mechanisms are in place to deal with such an event, is unclear.  The question appears to be for how long the criminal courts should delay that event.
50There is in this case a real difficulty in knowing how to assess the need for the protection of society.  In Veen's case the matter was easily resolved: the offender was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment.  In the present case there is no material before the Court to suggest whether there will be any change in circumstances after two, four or ten years.  Thus, to increase the sentence ""for the protection of society"" is to indulge in a degree of speculation leading to an arbitrary result.
Application of principles51The trial judge referred to Munn, a case in which the offender was sentenced for an attempt to strangle with intent maliciously to inflict grievous bodily harm under s 37 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), an offence which, although a lesser offence, carried the same maximum penalty of 25 years, but no standard non-parole period.  The matter went to trial, the principal issue being the intention of the accused.  The attack, committed on a woman with whom he had a somewhat unstable de facto relationship, occurred in a car on the side of the road.  It is not necessary for present purposes to expand upon the circumstances, except to note that, despite going to trial, the offender received a 15% discount for assistance to the authorities, giving rise to the calculation that the sentencing judge's starting point for the offence had been in the order of 10 years, eight months.  The sentence imposed involved a non-parole period of five years, six months and an additional term of three years, six months.  There was evidence of the offender having suffered a traumatic injury at nine years of age and having been sexually abused in his early teenage years.  Although the result involved a diminution of impulse control, and multiple contacts with mental health services, mainly as a result of drug induced psychosis, it was not clear that he suffered from a permanent psychiatric condition insusceptible to treatment.  This Court dismissed a severity appeal.
52The second case referred to by the sentencing judge was Bell, in which this Court dismissed a severity appeal, but in respect of a sentence of imprisonment of four years, with a non-parole period of two years, six months.  The point of similarity with the present case was that the offender made repeated statements to the effect that he had tried to kill his wife by choking her.  The primary ground of appeal was the failure to grant leniency on the basis that he had been charged with a more serious offence than that which the objective circumstances, without the voluntary disclosure, would have supported: at [11].  That ground was rejected, as was a separate ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
53The points of distinction between Bell and the present case are otherwise numerous.  In Mr Bell's case, there was a prior apprehended violence order with respect to his former wife; an apprehended domestic violence order in respect of the victim of the assault, which he had breached on an earlier occasion; an absence of any other prior record; the absence of mental illness and, significantly, a finding that the voluntary disclosure of his intention involved a high degree of remorse.
54In the present case, there were a number of elements favouring a degree of leniency.
(a) The act was clearly impulsive in the sense that it was not planned:  on the other hand, it was not provoked in any way by the conduct of the victim.(b) The harm suffered by the victim was temporary, the discomfort in swallowing being limited to a period of days.(c) The voluntary disclosure of the intention to kill almost certainly resulted in the charging of a more serious offence than would otherwise have been charged.  However, as noted by Grove J in Bell (Spigelman CJ and Bell J agreeing) an entitlement to some leniency for voluntary disclosure of intention ""does not extinguish ... responsibility for commission of that crime and reduce it to something less"": at [17].  Further, there must be care to avoid double counting with respect to the discount for the guilty plea.(d) The likelihood that the offender will serve his sentence with a higher degree of isolation in custody than would usually be the case deserves consideration, although how it will affect him, given his mental state, is less clear.(e) The most significant element favouring leniency, other than the voluntary disclosure of intention, is his level of mental illness.  There can be little doubt that it constituted a major cause of the offence and therefore reduced his responsibility and moral culpability.  That in turn permits reduced relevance to be accorded to general deterrence and, in all probability, to personal deterrence.
55Certain elements which might otherwise warrant a degree of leniency are not present.
(a) The offender cannot rely upon an absence of a significant criminal record: his record, given his age, is troubling, although it is probably in part reflective of his mental illness.(b) Although again probably partly due to his mental illness, there is no expression of remorse, nor insight into the nature of his conduct.(c) Other than treatment for his mental illness, there is little that favours special consideration in respect of rehabilitation.  Indeed, the likelihood of rehabilitation probably depends upon his acceptance of the need for treatment, particularly when eventually released from custody.  There is presently little material to support the likelihood of such acceptance.
These factors reveal that there is nothing warranting a finding of special circumstances in this case, for the purpose of adjusting the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence.
56There are a number of factors which favour a degree of severity.
(a) The seriousness of the offence, including the intention to kill, militates in favour of a significant custodial sentence.(b) The offence was carried out whilst in gaol serving a separate sentence for a specially aggravated offence of entering a dwelling with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.  This Court has noted the importance of maintaining discipline within the prison system and protecting other offenders from criminal assaults by fellow inmates, a matter which is reflected in the general requirement for such offences to be the subject of cumulative sentences: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 56; Regina v Fyffe [2002] NSWSC 751 at [33] (Barr J); Regina v Hoskins [2004] NSWCCA 236 at [60]-[63] (Levine J, Hulme J agreeing; Giles JA also agreeing in principle, considering that total accumulation would have been appropriate).(c) The evidence of mental illness also reveals an element of dangerousness and lack of insight into the causes of the violence revealed by this offence.  Those factors in turn warrant consideration of the need to protect society.  This matter requires further comment.
57In relation to the protection of society at large, the factor is one which, in the circumstances, can be given relatively little weight.  There is no evidence supporting a conclusion that there will be improvement in the immediate future.  Nevertheless, the offence cannot involve an indeterminate sentence and, in any event, the punishment for the crime must not exceed a proper sentence, disregarding the need to protect society.  The offender will have to be released sooner or later.  The appropriate mechanism for protecting society cannot be found in the criminal law; the need for protection arises from mental illness and it is through mental health legislation that such protection as may be available must be sought.  
58There being no basis for a finding of special circumstances, the sentence to be imposed should follow the statutory prescription in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
59The two factors which warrant a significant degree of departure from the sentence which the objective circumstances of the offending would appear to require are, firstly, the serious influence of mental illness on the offending and, secondly, the voluntary disclosure of the intention to kill.  Nevertheless, an appropriate sentence cannot be less than seven years imprisonment.  That figure, reduced by 25% for the plea of guilty gives a sentence of five years, four months (64 months).  That sentence should consist of a non-parole period of four years and a balance of term of 16 months.
60The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed by the District Court on 15 December 2011.
(2) Resentence the offender to a period of imprisonment for five years, four months, being a non-parole period of four years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 16 months.
(3) Direct that the sentence commence on 29 October 2011.
(4) Note that the first date on which the offender will be eligible for release on parole is 28 October 2015.  The sentence will expire on 28 February 2017.
61PRICE J:  I agree with Basten JA.
62S G CAMPBELL J:  I have had the considerable advantage of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft.  With respect, I agree with his Honour's conclusion that the sentence imposed below was manifestly inadequate, and I agree also with the sentence his Honour proposes and the orders set out at [60].  However, as my thinking differs in some respects from his Honour's, I consider it appropriate that I state briefly my own reasons where they differ.
63My view is different in relation to the degree of leniency being due in the case by reference to the principles discussed in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603; and what effect the influence of the offender's undoubted mental illness should have on sentencing.
R v Ellis
64I agree with the legal analysis of the presiding judge at [35] to [39].  With respect, I disagree that without the offender's confession the element of intention might not have been capable of proof to the criminal standard [36].  The evidence at first instance was not extensive, but the objective facts capable of being established without the offender's admission included the considerations that the offender employed a ligature to strangle the victim, that he persisted with the strangulation until the victim was rendered unconscious, prostrate and had urinated himself, and then left him for dead.
65In accordance with the barrister's adage, there is no case that cannot be improved by the introduction of a ""verbal"" (subject to ss 85 and 86 Evidence Act 1995, of course), but the simple, easily provable facts underpinning the offending are, in my judgment, sufficient to prove the offence charged.
66I also accept the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that a possible alternative basis of criminal liability is provided by s 37 covering, inter alia, attempts to strangle a person with intent to commit an indictable offence, which carries the same maximum penalty as attempted murder under s 29 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (imprisonment for 25 years).  It is true that s 37 is not subject to a standard non-parole period under Division 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  That the legislature has prescribed a standard non-parole period for an offence may be relevant to an assessment of its seriousness, but it is [t]he maximum penalty for a statutory offence [which] serves as an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence:  Muldrock v The Queen [2011] 244 CLR 120 at [31], and the cases there cited.  
67To these considerations should be added reference to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v MW [2007] NSWCCA 291 at [43], referred to by the appellant below and on appeal:
There will be varying degrees of criminality in an offence contrary to s 37...  It must be remembered that the offence itself is defined as an ""attempt to choke"".  When that attempt results in the victim becoming unconscious the offence is one of considerable gravity.
The reference the Crown make to S v Regina (2008) 186 A Crim R 505 at 508 [10], in my opinion is also apposite.  Bell JA (as her Honour then was) pointed out that leniency... may be extended in a case in which an offender voluntarily discloses his or her guilt of an offence which he or she was not suspected of committing.  
68At 508 [11], her Honour stated that the applicant was deserving of a discount for his candour in making admissions to the police.  That was a similar case where her Honour formed a view that the admissions provided the basis for preferring a particular charge.  However, she emphasised that it was not to be overlooked that the prosecution were, absent the admissions, in possession of evidence which would have supported the prosecution for a serious drug offence in any event.
Mental illness
69Basten JA regards the offender's level of mental illness as the other, indeed the first, factor warranting a significant degree of departure from the sentence which the objective circumstances of the offending would appear to require [59].
70With respect, I agree with the presiding judge that there can be little doubt that [the mental illness] constituted a major cause of the offence ([54](e)).  Consistently with principle, his Honour said that this factor reduces responsibility, moral culpability, the relevance of general deterrence, and in all probability personal deterrence.
71In a powerful analysis of the judgments in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, his Honour concluded that given the principle of proportionality, the protection of society in the instant sentencing exercise was an unattainable goal, at least if impermissible preventative detention on the one hand, and arbitrariness on the other, were to be avoided.
72I accept on the medical evidence in the case it is of the nature of the personality disorder, or disorders, from which the respondent suffers, and notwithstanding the treatment he has undergone, and will undergo, whilst incarcerated, that he poses risks to other inmates in the criminal justice system and people in the wider community upon his eventual release.  Clearly the prognosis is very poor.  I fully accept the force of the presiding judge's reasoning at [49]-[50]. Where I differ from his Honour, with respect, is, notwithstanding the hard reality identified by Basten JA, in my view the protection of society remains a relevant and valid consideration in arriving at a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed by the respondent.
73It may be that the dilemma thrown into relief so starkly by Basten JA's analysis is, in the end, insuperable.  But for as long as the offender is imprisoned the statutory purpose of the protection of the community from the danger he poses is furthered.  
74It seems to me that there is difficulty with the idea that if the public cannot be protected absolutely from the dangerously mentally ill then the protection of the community can have no place in the instinctive synthesis by which a sentencing court reaches its conclusion.  At the same time, I accept completely that to increase the sentence ""for the protection of society"" [50], beyond that which proportionality will bear, would lead to impermissible preventative detention.  
75The majority Justices in Veen (No 2), as Basten JA points out, recognised this anomaly.  The only answer to the conundrum provided by the majority Justices is that sentencing is not a purely logical exercise.  As their Honours pointed out in the passage quoted by Basten JA: 
The purposes of criminal punishment ... sometimes ... point in different directions. And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter.  These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality.
Sometimes it must follow that the protection of society will outweigh the diminution in an offender's moral culpability.  On balance the process of instinctive synthesis may produce a sentence no less severe than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from mental abnormality.  
76The presiding judge has found that the relevance of personal deterrence in the present case is reduced ([41]; [54](e)).  As Gleeson CJ when Chief Justice of New South Wales pointed out in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68:
...a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.
At 68 his Honour pointed out that no:
...automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. 
And at 71 his Honour re-emphasised the point in this way:
... the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles.  The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case.  For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. 
77However these differences do not lead me to a different result from the orders proposed by the presiding judge: [s]entencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 [46]; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59.  
78I agree with Basten JA that an appropriate sentence cannot be less than seven years imprisonment ([59]), the adjustments his Honour makes and the orders he proposes.

		16 October 2012",2012-10-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760254,R v Winter [2012] NSWCCA 218,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The respondent, Karen Winter, pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter that were committed when she was driving a motor vehicle and collided with, and killed, two pedestrians. The offences, which are contrary to s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, each carry a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
2The respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was afforded a 25% discount by the sentencing judge. His Honour imposed a sentence of 3 years imprisonment in relation to each offence and provided for an accumulation of 1 year. His Honour imposed a single non-parole period of 2 years. In the result the respondent was sentenced to a total of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.
3The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed the leniency of the sentences under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred by finding that epilepsy caused or contributed to the offences and that his Honour failed to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the respondent's driving on the day of the offences. It was further submitted that the sentences are manifestly inadequate.
4The respondent was aged 43 at the time of the offences. She lived at Edgeworth with her 19 year old son and a friend, Anita McCarthy. Ms McCarthy apparently moved in with the respondent in about September of 2010. Not long before Ms McCarthy took up residence the respondent had been involved in an accident in her work vehicle. The respondent told Ms McCarthy that she had ""blacked out"" whilst driving her work van on deliveries and had crashed into a letter box. Ms McCarthy assisted the respondent to find a replacement letter box and deliver it to the owner.
5Ms McCarthy also became aware that the respondent had other medical problems. She understood that the respondent was taking morphine tablets at night for pain and that she suffered from migraine headaches.
6The respondent was employed as a delivery driver. Her usual duties involved the collection and delivery of sanitary bins from various locations in Newcastle and the Central Coast. On the day of the collision, 7 October 2010, she was driving a white Toyota HiAce van. 
7On that day the respondent commenced her rounds at about 7 am. At about 10.30 am she went to the Warners Bay Medical Centre at Warners Bay as part of her rounds. Whilst she was at the Centre she suffered a vasovagal episode and almost fainted when she was completing the exchange of the hazard waste bins. She required medical treatment and was treated by Dr Carruthers at the Centre. She told the doctor that she was suffering from a migraine headache that was causing her severe pain. The trial judge found that she had had this headache for about 24 hours.
8Dr Carruthers prescribed a treatment of 10 milligrams of Maxolon and 15 milligrams of morphine by injection. The nurse who gave the injection told the respondent that she was not to drive her vehicle for the rest of the day. The respondent lied and told the nurse that she had a colleague in her van outside who would be able to drive her home. Instead of complying with the nurse's direction after receiving the injection the respondent left the surgery and went to her vehicle and drove home. She arrived at about 11.30 am and was met by Ms McCarthy. The respondent asked Ms McCarthy to ring the medical centre to tell them that the respondent had arrived home safely and to also tell them that Ms McCarthy had been the driver. Ms McCarthy did as she was asked.
9Ms McCarthy encouraged the respondent to lie down for a while and offered to ring her employer to advise that the respondent would bring the work van back the following day. However, the respondent did not take up this offer. She went to her bedroom and smoked two or three cones of cannabis and, after about 35 to 45 minutes, told Ms McCarthy that she was going to take the van back to her employer. Ms McCarthy asked whether the respondent was feeling alright. The respondent replied ""I'm fine. I feel better."" Ms McCarthy offered to go with the respondent but she rejected the offer saying ""No, it's okay, I'm fine. The sooner I get up there, the sooner I get back."" The sentencing judge found that the respondent left home at about 12.45 pm.
10At about 2 pm the respondent was driving the van east along Main Road, Edgeworth towards the intersection of Main Road and Minmi Road. The speed limit in that area was 70 kilometres an hour. The speed the respondent was travelling is not known. The weather was overcast and the roadway dry.
11At this location Main Road consists of two traffic lanes in each direction with additional turning lanes in each direction for traffic turning from Main Road into Minmi Road. For vehicles travelling east, the Main Road presents a generally level section of roadway with a slight right-hand curve through the intersection. At the intersection there is a dedicated pedestrian crossing controlled by traffic lights. The Edgeworth Tavern stands to the northern side of the intersection and has concrete footpath outside between the tavern and the road.
12As the respondent approached the intersection Ms Janet Sharples and Ms Rebecca Weir were standing on the footpath outside the tavern waiting to cross the road. A witness, Ms Jacqueline Hornery, was also driving along Main Road approaching the intersection. Ms Hornery was travelling east on Main Road in the lane nearest the median strip and was travelling about 50 to 60 kilometres per hour. She saw the respondent's vehicle overtake in the left lane and travel through the intersection while the traffic lights were green.
13At the point where Main Road began to curve to the right the respondent's vehicle continued straight on, colliding with the northern kerb. The front side of the van then collided with the traffic light on the edge of the footpath, knocking it horizontal. It then continued on, mounted the footpath in front of the Tavern and collided with Ms Sharples and Ms Weir. Both Ms Sharples and Ms Weir were severely injured. Ms Sharples died at the scene and Ms Weir a short time later in hospital.
14After colliding with the pedestrians the respondent's vehicle continued on until it hit the wall of the Tavern. The respondent remained in the driver's seat until Mr Raub, a bystander, reached in and turned the engine off. When the vehicle began to roll backwards the respondent put the vehicle into park which stopped it from moving any further. The respondent then spoke to Mr Raub saying ""What's happened?"" Mr Raub responded ""I'm not sure. Are you okay?"" The respondent apparently replied ""Yes, I'm fine.""
15When the respondent was still in the vehicle she was spoken to by Ms Hornery who observed her to be looking straight ahead and shuffling through papers on a clipboard. The respondent looked at Ms Hornery and said ""What's up? What's going on?"" Ms Hornery replied ""You have been in an accident. I want you stay in the car."" The respondent then said ""Did I do this? Did I cause this? Did I hit someone?"" Ms Hornery replied ""People have been hit. I want you to stay in the car.""
16Ms Hornery concluded that the respondent had no idea what had happened. The respondent then alighted from the van and dropped to the ground crying and saying ""Did I do this?"" The respondent remarked that ""I have had a headache all day."" Ms Hornery said that the respondent seemed really strange one minute and panicky about the accident the next and that she ""Didn't seem to know where she was."" When the police arrived the respondent told them that she had a migraine headache. She said that she remembered travelling in the slow lane approaching the traffic lights but remembered nothing further about the accident. She said that ""I always slow down for those traffic lights so I wouldn't have been doing faster than 60 kilometres an hour.""
17The sentencing judge recorded that the respondent denied to the constable who questioned her that she had suffered from blackouts or fainting. When she was asked when she had last seen a doctor she replied ""About two months ago and it was for the flu.""
18The respondent was subjected to a breath test which proved negative. However, when she was later taken to hospital for blood and urine samples she was found to have 0.006 milligrams per litre of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and 0.036 milligrams per litre of delta-9-THC acid in her blood. Metoclopramide was also found in her urine sample. Dr Judith Perl, a forensic pharmacologist, later certified that the respondent was ""under the influence of cannabis to the extent that her driving ability was impaired, but it is also possible that there was additional impairment due to some uncontrolled medical condition capable of producing blackouts.""
19The respondent later spoke to her treating doctor. The doctor recorded that the respondent told her that she could remember approaching the traffic lights and slowing down at the intersection. The respondent said that as she approached the intersection she felt she was going to be sick and planned to pull over after the lights. The respondent told the doctor that she remembered a man opening the door of her vehicle after the collision. 
20A mechanical examination of the vehicle found no mechanical defect that may have contributed to a collision.
21Having found these facts, the sentencing judge turned to consider the extent of the moral culpability of the respondent. He identified the question of concern to him as being ""the extent of her knowledge of her vulnerability to have blackouts.""
22The sentencing judge acknowledged that the agreed facts included the statement that the respondent had a vasovagal episode at the Warners Bay Medical Centre earlier that day during which she almost fainted. His Honour referred to the other events which happened at the Centre to which I have previously referred.
23The sentencing judge found that the respondent had blacked out just before the accident. His Honour rejected evidence given by the respondent that she had not blacked out on any previous occasion. His Honour said: ""I do not believe her. Evidence tendered in reply overwhelmingly demonstrates otherwise."" His Honour referred to hospital notes from the Calvary Mater hospital of 30 June 2010, 4 months before the accident, which include as part of the respondent's history:
""Some months ago collapse in shower, woke on shower floor with black eye, sat on floor for some time, memory poor, saw general practitioner next day.""
24His Honour also referred to the fact that there was a further medical note stating that the respondent had reported dizzy spells and collapsing in public on 8 March 2010. Furthermore, there is a reference to similar episodes in 1998 when the respondent lost consciousness.
25There was evidence before his Honour that after the incident giving rise to the charges the respondent was diagnosed with epilepsy and is now being medicated for it. However, the sentencing judge also found that the evidence ""shows that there was a connection between her migraine headaches and previous losses of consciousness."" His Honour then said:
""Although the episode of 30 June 2010 [a reference to the notes from the Calvary Mater hospital] does not appear to have been preceded by a headache, that is, the one where she collapsed in public, on the day of the accident she told Dr Carruthers that she had had a migraine for the preceding 24 hours. She also felt faint at the premises at Warners Bay, but without a loss of consciousness. After the morphine injection she was advised not to drive. That advice, however, was not given because of a history of a loss of consciousness preceded by headaches as the evidence before me demonstrates, as it was not known to Dr Carruthers. In other words, what Dr Carruthers was treating was her complaint of migraine headache and the warning was given to her as a conventional warning given to all those who receive morphine injections.""
26His Honour then expressed a conclusion that the blackout suffered by the respondent was the ""proximate cause"" of the accident and that that blackout had not been caused by the cannabis smoked by the respondent.
27His Honour then referred to Dr Perl's certificate and made the following finding:
""I find that the offender's culpability is founded upon the fact that she knew that after or when she had migraine headaches she might lose consciousness and that in the hours before this accident she had had a migraine of extended duration. She had become light-headed at least to the extent that she required medical attention and yet she chose to drive the van with the attendant risk that she might lose consciousness whilst doing so and thus cause an accident such as the one which eventuated.""
28His Honour stated that although the respondent had been warned not to drive he did not believe this had a particular role to play in the cause of the accident. His Honour said:
""The reason she blacked out was not because of the morphine injection. The reason she blacked out was because of the underlying medical condition that she endured, and she knew it. She knew that when she had migraines there was a risk that she could lose consciousness and she drove that day knowing that that risk existed.""
29His Honour considered the culpability of the respondent in the context of the decision in the District Court in Gillett [2005] NSWDC 3. His Honour did not conclude that the respondent's culpability was as high as that of Ms Gillett, who had set about to deceive the Roads & Traffic Authority by deliberately lying when she denied that she suffered from epilepsy when applying for the renewal of her licence.
30His Honour went on to conclude that in all probability the respondent's blackouts derived from the fact that she suffered from epilepsy, although that was not diagnosed at the time of the accident. Although he expressed this conclusion he also said ""she did, however, know that she was prone to lose consciousness in circumstances such as those which prevailed in the hours before this accident.""
31His Honour then turned to consider the subjective circumstances of the respondent. He described her as a ""battler"" who had worked as a nurse but left that calling to look after her aging parents. She has a son who lives with her in Department of Housing accommodation but as a result of the accident she has lost that house. His Honour concluded that she had a social network but ""as her referees demonstrate, will need support to re-integrate into the community on her release."" For this reason his Honour found special circumstances.
32His Honour found that although the respondent denied having previous blackouts she accepted responsibility for the present crimes. His Honour concluded that the respondent was genuinely remorseful. His Honour also found that, although the respondent was on a bond at the time of the offence, she nevertheless had good prospects of rehabilitation which will be assisted by her supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. This finding was relevant to his Honour's finding of special circumstances. 
33The sentencing remarks did not express a conclusion in relation to the level of culpability of the respondent. Although his Honour found that it was not as high as that of Ms Gillett he did not otherwise make a finding in respect of that matter. His Honour also indicated that he was mindful of what had been said by this Court in Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 but concluded this was not a case where the offender's driving can be characterised as a flagrant breach of the road rules.
34Although the Crown advanced an argument in this Court that his Honour had erred in finding that epilepsy caused or contributed to the offence, I do not believe that that issue is of any significance. It may be, as his Honour suggested, that the respondent's blackouts are the result of an epileptic condition. However, the respondent's moral culpability is found in the fact that she was aware that when she was suffering from migraine headaches there was a risk that she would lose consciousness. The critical finding that his Honour made was that the respondent drove on the relevant day ""knowing that that risk existed."" 
35Although his Honour did not place any significance in the advice that the respondent had been given that she should not drive because she had received a morphine injection, his Honour found that the respondent ignored that advice. His Honour also found that she smoked cannabis and her blood tests revealed that she was affected to an extent that her driving ability was impaired. 
36Having regard to the findings which his Honour made the significant issue for this Court to determine is whether or not the sentences that his Honour imposed sufficiently reflect the respondent's moral culpability. I am in no doubt that they do not.
37This Court has regrettably on many occasions had to consider circumstances where a person has driven a motor vehicle when, by reason of their knowledge of an existing medical condition or a state of inebriation, this should not have occurred. In Gillett v R [2006] NSWCCA 370; 166 A Crim R 419, which involved the offence of dangerous driving causing death, I said at 437-438 [47]:
""Where, as in the present case, a person takes control of a motor vehicle in circumstances where they know they represent a real risk to others and it is a risk over which they have no control, they must expect that, if the risk materialises, the penalty which will be imposed will reflect the fact that their offending had a high degree of criminality. A licence to drive a motor vehicle is a privilege which carries with it significant obligations. Those obligations require the driver to not only drive safely on the road but also to ensure that by reason of their physical health and capacity they do not endanger the lives of others. If that obligation is not met and injury or death is occasioned to others, a severe penalty will be appropriate in most cases. Every user of the road accepts a risk of injury or death. Those risks are only acceptable if other users of the road do what they can to minimise or avoid identifiable risks.""
38In Woodbridge v R [2010] NSWCCA 185; (2010) 208 A Crim R 503 R S Hulme J examined a number of cases in which an offender was sentenced for manslaughter arising from the use of a motor vehicle. 
39His Honour said at [24]-[35]:
""Sentences imposed in earlier cases also provide some guidance in the case of both offences. The Appellant in R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; (1999) 110 A Crim R 198 was found guilty of one count of manslaughter. The deceased was 16 and a learner driver whom the Appellant had encouraged to drink and drive his car because he was too drunk to drive. His encouragement extended to her driving approximately 35 kilometres over a 3 hour period interrupted by stops to drink more alcohol and at speeds of up to 150 kph. In the car were 2 younger brothers of the deceased who, a number of times urged the deceased to slow down. Ultimately the deceased lost control of the car. She was killed instantly and the Appellant received severe head injuries. The blood alcohol concentration of the deceased was 0.167 and of the Appellant some 5 hours after the collision, 0.103. Expert evidence estimated his range at the time of the collision to have been between 0.13 and 0.178. 
This Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence that included a non-parole period of 7 years and an additional term of 2 years and 4 months. Barr J, with whom Sully and Ireland JJ agreed, said that the case was of such a serious nature as to be seen as falling into the worst category of cases of its kind and that the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. 
In R v Do [2000] NSWCCA 459 the Respondent to a Crown appeal had been found guilty of 2 counts of manslaughter. He had driven his fully laden truck with a gross weight of 21 tonnes along Mona Vale Road. When he reached the top of a hill near where there was a sign that read, ""Truck must use low gear"", the vehicle was seen to accelerate very quickly reaching what Beazley JA described as a ""terrifyingly high speed"". Thereafter, he tried unsuccessfully to put the truck into gear and control it. However, at the bottom of the hill the vehicle mounted the apron of a roundabout, collided with a car killing the driver and then a house killing an occupant.
Beazley JA, with whom Wood CJ at CL and O'Keefe J agreed, said that the evidence did not establish deliberate acceleration on the part of the Respondent and that it was apparent that the basis upon which he had been sentenced was ""that there had been a criminally negligent act at some point, probably at the commencement of the downgrade, involving an 'initial abandonment of responsibility'"". The Respondent was a hard working family man whose subjective factors were referred to as ""substantial"". He was sentenced on each charge to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4 years comprising a minimum term of 3 years with an additional term of 1 year. In dismissing the appeal, Beazley JA observed that the sentences imposed were not manifestly inadequate although ""at the very bottom of the range"". The Crown had not sought to challenge the concurrency of the sentences. 
In R v Ryan (2003) 39 MVR 395 this Court reduced to a head sentence of 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years, a sentence of 7 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 5 years for one count of aggravated dangerous driving causing death. An offence of knowingly failing to stop and give assistance was taken into account and a 25% discount had been allowed for the offender's plea. The principal offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The circumstances of the offence were that in a 60 kph area the offender had been driving at in excess of 135 kph and, after a braking skid that extended for something of the order of 64 metres, ran into the rear of another vehicle stopped at traffic lights, forcing that vehicle into an intersection. He had been observed for some 3 kilometres prior to the collision travelling at speeds estimated at between 90 and 140 kph. The offender had a significant record for driving offences but was otherwise of good character and Grove J, with whom Ipp JA and Shaw J agreed, held that the original sentencing judge had erred in his approach to this. 
...
In R v Cameron [2005] NSWCCA 359; (2005) 157 A Crim R 70, the Respondent pleaded guilty to 3 counts of manslaughter and one count of aggravated driving in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm. Although never licensed, the Respondent had been permitted to drive a powerful 5 litre V8 car in which were 4 passengers including the car's owner. The Respondent drove into a 50 kph area in Parkes at speeds considerably in excess of 100 kph and despite requests by his passengers to slow down. He lost control and ultimately smashed into a telegraph pole splitting the vehicle in two and resulting in the death of 3 passengers and injury to the front seat passenger. 
The Respondent had prior convictions the details of which are not disclosed in the report and was on a 2 years good behaviour bond at the time of the offences, a circumstance that was regarded as a matter of aggravation. When a blood sample was subsequently taken in hospital, the Respondent's blood alcohol content was 0.114. Expert opinion was that at the time of collision it was higher. By the time of sentence he was regarded as genuinely contrite and remorseful. He had been attacked and rendered unconscious in prison and was on protection. 
On each count of manslaughter the Respondent was originally sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. There was partial accumulation of the sentences with the overall period in custody being 4 years with an additional 4 years sentence. In a Crown appeal, this Court held that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and re-sentenced the offender on each count of manslaughter to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance term of 3 years, accumulating those sentences to result in an effective sentence of a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance term of 3 years. The sentence imposed on the grievous bodily harm charge was made concurrent.
Grove J, with whom Hislop J agreed, observed that the Respondent's conduct must be regarded as being of a high order of culpability, and said that the sentence on each manslaughter count imposed by this Court was arrived at after reducing a notional sentence of 9 years that took account of objective and subjective factors by 2 years for the offender's plea and that in re-sentencing the usual restraint in Crown appeals was being applied. McClellan CJ at CL who also agreed with Grove J, observed that those sentences were the minimum that could be imposed and, but for the fact that the proceedings were a Crown appeal and the offender had to be sentenced at the lowest end of the available range, a significantly greater sentence may have been appropriate.
In Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1, the Respondent to a Crown appeal had pleaded guilty to 2 counts of manslaughter. He had been engaged in racing 2 other vehicles along the Great Western Highway at a speed of about 120 kph in a 60 kph speed zone. The Respondent had a blood alcohol reading of 0.031 at the time a blood sample was taken in hospital but the expert Dr Perl thought that his blood alcohol level at the time of the collision was likely to have been 0.063. The blood also revealed the presence of the residue of cannabis, and Dr Perl was of the opinion that there would have been some impairment of driving skill from intoxication both by alcohol and drugs. The vehicle he was driving struck a vehicle that was making a right hand turn out of the highway into a side street, killing the driver and passenger in that vehicle. After a discount of 25% for his pleas, the Respondent was sentenced on each count to imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years on one count and for 7 years including a non-parole period of 4 years on the second. The sentences were partially accumulated such that the effective total term was of 6 years non-parole with an additional term of 3 years. 
The Respondent was 37 and had a criminal record that was regarded as disentitling him to the leniency that a first offender might have received. Although the appeal was dismissed on grounds of parity with a co-offender against whom no Crown appeal had been brought, Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed, said that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and that, had the Court interfered, and notwithstanding the principle of double jeopardy, the very least sentence that could have been imposed was one of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. (It is not entirely clear but it seems to me probable that Howie J was talking of an effective total sentence for the 2 offences.) His Honour also remarked (probably with the concurrence of the other members of the bench), that had he been sitting at first instance he would have imposed more. His Honour also observed that the fact that the racing in which the Respondent was engaged involved 3 vehicles, the potential dangerousness to the public was increased well beyond the criminality considered in R v Cameron. ""
40In Ryan Grove J created a table that set out the details of ten previous cases of aggravated driving causing death. This is of course a lesser offence than manslaughter. It is unnecessary to explore the detail of each case in this judgment. However, it is apparent that the sentence imposed in the present matter is significantly lower than some of the sentences for the offences included in Grove J's table.
41This Court has long recognised the difficulties in identifying the appropriate sentence for the offence of manslaughter. The problems were discussed by the Chief Justice in R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1. Both the remarks of R S Hulme J above and the Chief Justice make plain that critical to the appropriate sentence will be the identification of an offender's moral culpability. This is a complex task in the present case.
42The sentencing judge found that the applicant drove in circumstances when she knew that she could lose consciousness. That risk was not a mere possibility. The respondent knew that she had had a vasovagal episode that morning and had almost fainted. On a previous occasion she had blacked out and lost control of her motor vehicle. Although the sentencing judge believed that it was appropriate to exclude consideration of the fact that the respondent had received morphine, smoked cannabis and been warned not to drive again that day I do not believe that it was open to him to do so. His Honour found that it was only the migraine and the possibility of an epileptic seizure that were the proximate cause of the accident. Even if that was the case, the respondent had been so unwell that she required medical treatment, including a morphine injection, and was told to go home to rest and not drive again that day.
43Although the doctor and nurse who treated the respondent were not aware of the possibility of epilepsy the advice that they gave was sound and, if followed, the tragedy would have been avoided. Of course, not only did the respondent ignore that advice but she increased the risk of an accident by driving the vehicle under the influence of cannabis and morphine.
44The conjunction of these circumstances would, but for one matter, suggest that it is appropriate to conclude that the culpability of the respondent is of a very high order. The reservation that I have is that the respondent did report that after she had smoked the marijuana (and no doubt with a contribution from the morphine) she felt better and able to continue her work for the day. Of course this was a false sense of well being induced by the combination of drugs and could never justify the complete abandonment of her obligations to others by resuming driving. However, no doubt motivated by a desire to fulfil her obligations to her employer, she allowed her apparent sense of wellbeing to prevail as against the obligations she owed to those who may be using or near the roads she travelled.
45I am satisfied that the finding that the respondent's loss of consciousness was the result of the respondent's undiagnosed epilepsy has caused his Honour to diminish the respondent's culpability for the offences, which has in turn led to the imposition of erroneously lenient sentences. Although not of the highest order of culpability, the respondent's determination to return to work in the face of the medical advice she had been given and her own knowledge of her potential to lose consciousness places her moral culpability at a high level. It is important to bear in mind that the respondent was charged with and pleaded guilty to manslaughter rather than to one of the statutory offences concerned with injury or death to others as the result of using a motor vehicle. The offence is accordingly, more serious than the offences considered in the guideline judgments in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 or R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252.
46The respondent submitted that the facts of the present case were unique. As with many other cases of manslaughter there is no case with similar facts of which I am aware. Gillett has some similarity in that in that case the offender falsely denied having epilepsy which would have precluded her from obtaining a licence.
47The respondent emphasised that the sentencing judge had found that the respondent was genuinely remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. The medical evidence before his Honour indicated that it was likely that the respondent would serve her sentence in more onerous circumstances than other prisoners. In particular because the respondent suffers from epilepsy she will require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
48Although his Honour found that there were good prospects of rehabilitation, that finding has a diminished significance when the respondent's record and her circumstances at the time of those offences are considered. The respondent has a criminal history which involves some dishonesty offences. She was sentenced for 11 counts of false pretence in 1988 for which she received a bond. She was also convicted of one count of altering a prescription in relation to morphine in 2009. Again she received a bond. This was the bond that was current at the time of the present offences.
49There was also evidence that the respondent was serving a periodic detention order at the time of the offences, although these offences did not appear on her criminal history. The respondent's driving record included four occasions of exceeding the speed limit. 
50With respect to the issue of remorse it must be remembered that even before the sentencing judge the respondent continued to deny that she was aware that she had previously blacked out when suffering from a migraine. That lie, as his Honour found it to be, is quite inconsistent with a person who is remorseful and accepts responsibility for her offending.
51The sentencing judge found that the respondent will need assistance to reintegrate into the community and accordingly found special circumstances. His Honour reflected this finding by providing an overall non-parole period which is 50% of the total sentence. 
52The finding of special circumstances is not directly challenged by the Crown although, of course, it forms part of the challenge to the overall sentence which is submitted to be manifestly inadequate. This Court is always reluctant to intervene in relation to a finding of special circumstances. The issues were discussed by the Court in R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 by Spigelman CJ (Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) at [31]. However, in the present case I do not believe that a proportion of 50% is appropriate.
53I am mindful of the fact that this is a Crown appeal. The principles appropriate to Crown appeals have been considered in many cases. These cases make plain that such appeals should be rare. As was recently emphasised by the High Court in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at 465 [1], a primary purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D is 'to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons'. This is a primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the court's discretion to intervene in Crown appeals, even where error is demonstrated: see also Griffiths v R (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310 (Barwick CJ). However, as was indicated by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42; (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 the court's power to intervene ""extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand"": see also Everett v R (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [61] and [62] and Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58] and [109]. 
54In my opinion, the sentences handed down by Toner DCJ are so disproportionate to the offences committed by the respondent as to warrant the intervention of this Court. 
55In my opinion the sentences imposed in the District Court should be quashed and the respondent resentenced. In resentencing the respondent, I have taken into account the evidence concerning the respondent's health and treatment in custody, including the affidavits furnished to the Court following the hearing of the appeal. Having regard to all the matters to which I have referred, the appropriate sentence in relation to count 1 is a total sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. A similar sentence is appropriate in relation to count 2. I would provide an identifiable period of custody for count 1 of 2 years.
56Accordingly I would impose an aggregate sentence of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years.
Orders:
1.Uphold the appeal and quash the sentences imposed in the District Court.2.In relation to count 1, sentence the respondent to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 17 November 2011 and concluding on 16 November 2015 with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 16 November 2018. 3.In relation to count 2, sentence the respondent to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 17 November 2013 and concluding on 16 November 2017 with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 16 November 2020. 
57JOHNSON J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
58GARLING J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

2760263,R v Dunn [2012] NSWDC 192,"Judgment

Introduction

1The accused Jack James Dunn was arraigned on an indictment alleging that, on 14 May 2011 in company with others, he had attempted to break and enter premises at Belrose with intent to steal on 14 May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to that charge. In accordance with orders I had made earlier his trial was held without a jury, with me as the judge determining whether the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 

2I heard evidence about the commission of the offence. It is clear that someone attempted to break and enter into the premises at Belrose with the intention of stealing from those premises. I am easily able to find that beyond reasonable doubt. What is at issue is whether the accused was one of the men involved.

3The police had been investigating the activities of a number of people, including the accused, for some time. As part of those investigations a number of types of electronic surveillance were used. In particular, telephones were intercepted and listening devices were installed. Two of the telephones which were intercepted were those of the accused. Over the period that the telephone intercept warrants were in force a large number of voice calls involving the accused's telephones were recorded, something in the order of 3,800. Although at times his telephone was being used by other people, for the majority of the time his voice could be heard on those calls. 

4 A listening device had also been installed in a stolen Mercedes Benz motor vehicle. That device recorded sounds emanating from within and near to the motor vehicle. The motor vehicle was used in the offence and a number of conversations between those involved in the offence were recorded. Those recordings included conversation before the offence was committed and during its commission. Indeed on the recording the sounds of a sledge hammer being used in an attempt to break into the premises could clearly be heard. 

5There is no dispute that the listening device records the voices of people who are guilty of the offence. The issue for me to determine is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one of the voices recorded was that of the accused. 

6The Crown case against the accused is based solely on the recordings. The Crown says that police officers who have listened both to the listening device recording and the telephone intercept recordings have become ad hoc experts in identifying the voice of the accused. They gave evidence that in their opinion one of the voices heard on the listening device recording was that of the accused. The Crown case is that the police officers had become very familiar with the voice of the accused through listening to the results of the telephone intercept warrant and so their opinion should be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown also purports to rely on some of the things said in the conversations recorded on the listening device, in particular those parts of the recording where one of the people involved in the offence used the name of the accused - ""Jack"", a derivation of it - ""Dunny"", or his nickname - ""Crack"".

Preliminary Matters

7I will set out some preliminary matters. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury were this a trial where a jury decided the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

8I will determine all the relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case was made up of what witnesses said in Court and the evidence which has been tendered. I have made no enquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. 

9The most important and fundamental principle of law which I apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. The accused starts from the position that he is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty.

10The accused did not give evidence. I have not used that in any way against him. The accused was entitled to say nothing in Court and make the Crown prove his guilt if it could. The fact that the accused did not give evidence does not effect the fundamental proposition which I must apply - that is that the Crown must prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

11So the silence of the accused in Court is not evidence against him. His election not to give evidence was not an admission made by him. His decision not to give evidence must not be used by me to fill gaps in the Crown case or make up any deficiencies or defects in the Crown's case that might exist.

Identification Evidence

12As I trust I have made clear the issue in this case is whether the accused's voice has been correctly identified. Should I accept beyond reasonable doubt the opinion of those police officers who say that, having heard the accused's voice repeatedly on the telephone intercept recordings, they are able to identify the accused's voice on exhibit 1, the listening device recording?

13Although the directions that a judge gives to a jury when identification is an issue are largely based on the need to impart the experience and wisdom of judges to lay jurors, the fact that this is a trial by judge alone does not obviate the need for me to explain why I have approached this issue cautiously.

14There is a difference between a witness' honesty and a witness' accuracy. Even though it may well be the case that the officers who expressed their opinions about the identification of the accused were doing so honestly, that does not mean that they were necessarily accurate. 

15Identification evidence is evidence which may well be unreliable. I must exercise caution before I accept that evidence. All identification evidence may be unreliable because mistakes are often and easily made and because what is at issue is not the honesty of the witness but the accuracy of the witness' conclusion. Identification evidence can be given in a very persuasive manner simply because of that fact - I repeat it is usually given by an honest witness who genuinely and firmly believes the truth of his or her evidence. 

Voice Identification

16It is important that I bear firmly in mind that all identification evidence may be unreliable but in particular identifying someone by their voice can be very fraught with difficulties indeed. When compared with the act of identification visually there are fewer objective features which can be examined. When visual identification is undertaken an objective comparison can be made of such things as the height of a person, the colour of their eyes, the shape of their nose, whether the person has freckles or not and so on. But those objective criteria are not readily found as one voice is compared to another. 

17The fact that more than one person believes that the voice is that of the accused may simply mean that more than one person has made an honest mistake. After all the voice is either the accused or someone who sounds sufficiently like him as to have his voice mistaken for that of the accused.

18As well as these general matters, in the particular circumstances of this case there are specific factors which effect the reliability of the identification evidence. They include the following:



Whilst the police listened to the sound of the accused's voice repeatedly as it appeared on the various telephone intercepts, the number of utterances of V3 (the person said to be the accused) on the listening device recording is comparatively small. The Crown said, without challenge from counsel for the accused, that there were 32 utterances totalling 119 words. Many of those however were very short exclamations and very few complete sentences were used.



Whilst technology is clearly improving as far at the product of listening devices is concerned, there remained on the listening device recording interference from such things as engine noise, and it appeared that the microphone part of the listening device was inside the car whilst the person said to be the accused remained at all times outside the car. At times the voice of V3 was indistinct.



Just as the accuracy of visual identification can be affected by the circumstance that a person from one culture is identifying a person from another background, so too does that problem arise as far as voice identification is concerned. Those of us not used to strong accents find it more difficult to recognise particular speakers with those accents than those of us who do have familiarity with such an accent. I note that in this case the accused is of aboriginal background. I might be wrong but it did not appear that any of the police officers had a similar background. In any case the Crown did not lead any evidence on this issue.



The police officers were comparing, in almost every case, the product of telephone intercepts with the product of listening devices. I simply do not know the fidelity of the product of the telephone intercepts. No recordings were played to me and I was not able to make my own assessment as to the quality of the sound they produced.



The person said to be V3 was wearing a mask, at least at the time of some of the recordings on the listening device. The evidence established that the persons attempting to commit this offence were seen on CCTV footage wearing masks. Thus there is the possibility that the wearing of a mask has introduced some distortion to the actual voice of the person said to be V3.



The utterances of the accused on the telephone intercepts and V3 on the listening device recordings were clearly said in different circumstances. One could expect that the voice of a person committing an offence might be somewhat different to that same person's voice when they are in a more relaxed frame of mind.



Human beings are very suggestible and they tend to hear what they are told they are going to hear. Instances of this abound in criminal cases around the world. In the present case some of the officers were told, before they had even listened to the listening device product, that other officers had formed the conclusion that V3 was this accused. That circumstance significantly diminishes the weight which I can place on those officers' acts of identification. 



A similar thing applies, to a lesser extent, to other officers. The accused was targeted as part of the operation carried out by police. Thus when those police heard a voice on the listening device they chose from quite a narrow pool of people whom they believed could be speaking. Although one of the officers said he was quite surprised to hear the voice of the accused, it remains the case that the officers would expect that the voices recorded on the listening device all came from people they were investigating. So to a greater or lesser extent there was a sub conscious bias in the mind of every police officer tending to induce them to identify the voice as that of the accused.


19The dangers involved with identification evidence in general, and with the identification evidence in this case in particular, have led me to look carefully to see if there is any other evidence tending to point to the conclusion that the Crown wishes me to draw, namely that the accused's voice was recorded on the listening device. Indeed I can confidently say that in the absence of any such evidence a verdict of not guilty would have been inevitable. Notwithstanding the obvious honesty of the officers who genuinely believe that they can recognise the accused's voice on the listening device recording, the problems with identification evidence generally, and which apply specifically to this case, are such that their opinions alone as to their recognition of the accused's voice would not satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt.

20But there is other evidence. I refer of course to the content of some parts of the listening device recording in which the crown case is that the words ""Jack"", ""Crack"", and ""Dunny"" appear. The accused's name is Jack Dunn and so it is highly likely that he would on occasions be referred to as ""Jack"", and not at all surprising if he was occasionally referred to as ""Dunny."" I recognise immediately that those police officers who listened to the accused's telephone calls did not hear him being referred to as ""Dunny"" on any occasion, but if the context of the utterance is such as to exclude other meanings of the word ""Dunny"", then if that word was used in addressing another person, that would be some evidence that the other person was the accused. As far as the name ""Crack"" is concerned, evidence was given by the police that on two occasions in the intercepted telephone calls the accused was referred to by that nickname. 

21It is therefore appropriate to examine whether the Crown is accurate in saying that the names ""Jack"" ""Crack"" or ""Dunny"" can be heard on the listening device recording and if so, the circumstances in which Mr Petterson and Mr O'Mealey, used those terms. I will return to those issues later.

Other evidence exculpating the accused

22The Crown called evidence from two of the men who were undoubtedly guilty of the offence with which the accused has been charged, Mr Petterson and Mr O'Mealey. Mr Petterson had already been sentenced. Mr O'Mealey was to be sentenced a few days after he was called by the Crown. Whilst he confirmed that he was involved in the offence he said that he would not answer any questions as to who else was involved. The Crown did not ask me to advise Mr O'Mealey that his attitude could be seen to be in contempt of Court and so his evidence was simply left at that. 

23Mr Petterson on the other hand gave evidence that Mr Dunn was not involved in the offence. I must confess at being somewhat surprised that the Crown did not ask Mr Petterson to listen to the listening device recording, in particular the part where the transcript attributes the word ""Dunny"" to Mr Petterson himself, and ask him firstly what he said and secondly what he meant by it. Mr Driels did not ask Mr Petterson those questions either. When I tried to ask what is, after all, an obvious series of questions, I discovered that the Crown prosecutor had not even brought to Court the necessary equipment to play the listening device recording. In those circumstances what Mr Petterson would have said is completely unknown. 

24It is not an exaggeration to say that the resolution of this case may well turn on whether Mr Pettersen did say ""Dunny"" as the transcript records. In Mr Driels submission the transcript was not accurate and the words actually used by Mr Petersen were ""Done, we're just up there"". In the Crown's submission the transcript was accurate. Whilst I can understand Mr Driel's reluctance to ask Mr Pettersen what he said, the same cannot be said about the Crown. The Crown complied with its obligation of fairness by calling Mr Pettersen, but its failure to ask whether he used the word ""Dunny"", and if so, what he meant is inexplicable. It should not have mattered to the Crown whether the answer was supportive of its case or not.

25It is of course a matter very much in the accused's favour that there is evidence from a witness that Mr Dunn was not one of the people present whilst the offence was being committed. 

Is there support for the accuracy of the identification evidence?

26I now return to examine whether the Crown is accurate in saying that the names ""Jack"" ""Crack"" or ""Dunny"" can be heard on the listening device recording and if so, what were the circumstances in which Mr Petterson and Mr O'Mealey, used those terms.

""Crack""

27The circumstances leading up to the commission of the offence included these: Neil Petterson and Sean O'Mealey were together in a stolen Mercedes motor vehicle. This was the car that had the listening device in it. The two men met up with a person, said by the Crown to be the accused, at a location some distance from Belrose where the offence was committed. The other person was driving a second motor vehicle, an Audi. Those in the Mercedes had a scanner with them capable of picking up police radio transmissions. The listening device in the Mercedes recorded the sounds of the scanner from time to time. At one stage police radio transmissions concerning an incident in Auburn can be heard. Petterson and O'Mealey discuss that matter. O'Mealey then says ""I think Crack wanted, wanted this one more than the other one"". Neil Petterson responds with ""hmm, I don't know"" and then ""I wish I was in the other one now its fucking raining. Should be right"". O'Mealey asks ""traction on?"" and Petterson says ""yeah I had it on the whole time"".

28It is clear that the reference to ""this one"" and ""the other one"" are references to the two motor vehicles - ""this one"" being the Mercedes in which Petterson and O'Mealey were travelling and ""the other one"" being the Audi in which someone else involved in the offence is travelling. Thus the statement by O'Mealey ""I think Crack wanted, wanted this one more than the other one"" tends to suggest that someone named Crack would have preferred to drive the Mercedes rather than the Audi. 

29I repeat that uncontested evidence was given in the Crown case that on two occasions on the telephone intercepts the accused was referred to as ""Crack,"" once by a person named Mel and once by his sister. 

30Putting all those circumstances together the use of the name ""Crack"" by Petterson, in the context in which it was used, supports the Crown case that this accused was in the Audi and thus involved in the later attempt to break into the premises at Belrose.

""Jack""

31The transcript prepared by police suggests that at another point on the listening device recording Neil Petterson is heard to say ""Jack probably said let me drive"". As I have just explained an Audi and a Mercedes were used by the offenders with the Crown case being that the accused was in the Audi. If the transcript is accurate then the context in which the name ""Jack"" is used in this part of the recording suggests that a person with that name was in the Audi and from what Neil Petterson knew of him it was likely that he would have wanted to drive that vehicle. This would tend to suggest that the accused was in the Audi as the vehicles travelled towards the location where the offence was committed. 

32However the transcript is not to take the place of the actual recording. Where there is a conflict between what I read in the transcript and what I hear (and don't hear) with my ears then it is the latter which must prevail. 

33In circumstances where the accuracy of the transcript is disputed, as in this case, it is disappointing indeed that the Crown did not initially make the recording available in a format which made it easy to replay, over and over again, discreet parts of the recording. At first I was told that this was not technically possible, but after inquiries were made, during the trial, it appeared that there was in fact no technical impediment to producing a version of the recording which made repeated review much easier. That version, in effect a working copy of exhibit 1, was tendered without objection. It became exhibit 3. The sounds on it were identical to the sounds on exhibit 1, but exhibit 3 was much easier to use.

34I have listened repeatedly to that part of the recording where Petersen purportedly says ""Jack probably said let me drive"" and I simply cannot hear the entirety of that phrase. The word ""Jack"" is very clear and I can make out the words ""probably"" and ""drive"" but the words in between are, to my ears, indistinct. 

35In those circumstances the support the Crown receives from the use of the name ""Jack"" is significantly diminished.

""Dunny""

36Towards the end of the listening device recording Petterson and O'Mealey are heard discussing how the offence of breaking and entering is to be committed. There are sounds consistent with the window of the car in which they are travelling being wound down and then Pettersen says something.

37The transcript records him as saying ""Dunny...just up there"". When the Crown prosecutor addressed me, he told me that Mr Petterson was speaking to someone outside the car. That is a possible interpretation if one relied only on the transcript. But having listened to the recording, rather than just relying on the transcript, it is beyond argument that the Crown Prosecutor's submission is just plain wrong. The volume of the voice is such that someone not in the car could not hear what was said. The volume of the voice is much lower than in later utterances, (where there is a reference to a ""sledgie""), which were obviously directed to a person outside the car.

38On top of that, the question arises as to the whether the transcript is accurate when it attributes the use of a name by which Mr Dunn might well be known to Mr Petterson. Once more I have listened repeatedly to this part of the recording. I simply cannot hear the term ""Dunny"" being used. I am not sure what I do hear, but I think that if I had to choose what I hear, I would say that it is much more likely to be ""Damien"" than ""Dunny"". I repeat - I do not hear the word ""Dunny"". I do not hear the word ""Done"". I hear something quite different, probably the word ""Damien"". I will proceed on that basis.

Conclusion

39So the Crown case comes down to the opinion of four officers who have listened to the accused's voice for many many hours and who each express the opinion that they recognise that voice on the listening device recording. Their opinions are supported in a minor way by the way by the use of the name ""Crack"" but there is nothing else to support the accuracy of their opinions, and the evidence of Mr Petterson was that the accused was not involved. 

40I have set out above the problems that exist with identification evidence generally, more specifically with voice identification, and even more specifically with the evidence of voice identification in the case before me. I cannot exclude the reasonable possibility that those opinions are mistaken. Particularly important in making this finding are the following:



The relatively small number of utterances made by the person said to be the accused on the listening device recording and



The influence of unconscious suggestion that the officers would likely hear either the voice of the accused or at the very least the voice of someone they had been investigating.

41For those reasons I find the accused not guilty.

		17 October 2012",2012-10-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760267,R v Fayda TALEB [2012] NSWDC 269,"Judgment

1Fayda Taleb was the owner of several cars. On 24 December 2010, just before midnight, one of the cars was recorded as exceeding the speed limit going through the Cross City Tunnel. Because Ms Taleb was the owner of the car - or as the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 describes it, its 'registered operator' - a penalty notice was issued to her. 

2Ms Taleb took the option of filling in a statutory declaration. She nominated someone else as driving the car at the time. The form said that ""the person named below was responsible for the offence."" The person she nominated was Hassan Farhat. The person's address she provided as 44 Preddys Road, Bexley. She provided a date of birth and opposite the words provided by the form for a licence number she wrote, ""International Lebanon"". 

3The State Debt Recovery Office prosecuted Ms Taleb claiming that in completing that statutory declaration she had falsely nominated Hassan Farhat as the person who was in charge of her car at the time that it was detected speeding through the Cross City Tunnel. Ms Taleb said she was not guilty of the offence and took the matter to court. 

4It came before his Honour Magistrate Pierce in the Local Court at the Downing Centre on 7 May 2012. His Honour found the offence proved and convicted Ms Taleb. Ms Taleb has appealed against her conviction. 

5When a person appeals to the District Court from a conviction in the Local Court the District Court judge hears the case as a fresh case. The judge is not usually concerned with whether there was any error in the reasoning of the magistrate in making the decision. The case is simply run again before the District Court judge. That is essentially what has happened in this case. 

6The State Debt Recovery Office was represented by Mr B. Hearnden and Ms Taleb was represented by Mr M. A. Sinadinovic and Mr B. Saddiq. 

7The evidence against Ms Taleb presented before his Honour, and before me, relied essentially upon what the Evidence Act 1995 calls coincidence evidence. The prosecutor tendered material which became exhibit C before me. It showed that this was not the first time that Ms Taleb had nominated someone else as driving her car when it had committed an offence which attracted a penalty notice. In fact on 3 previous occasions within about 13 months she had submitted a statutory declaration. On each occasion Ms Taleb nominated a different person as being the person responsible for the offence. In 2 of the other forms the person had the same address as Hassan Farhat. In a fourth form the person lived at an address in Carlton. However, in all 4 forms opposite the words ""licence number"" Ms Taleb had entered the same reference to an international licence issued in Lebanon. 

8There were 2 other important pieces of evidence in Mr Hearnden's case. One was that a search by the Australian Government department responsible for immigration had detected that no person bearing any of the names in the forms had entered or left Australia since 1990. I accept that that cut off date was reasonable. In addition no person bearing any of those names had held a driver's licence in Australia nor had any recorded contact with any of the Australian licensing authorities. 

9Mr Hearnden's case is that the last form - which is the relevant one for this offence - was filled in falsely, specifically concerning the name Hassan Farhat. His proposition is that there was a growing improbability from the time of the first form being submitted until the last (over some 13 months) that each time the same facts had occurred. It was so improbable, he said, as to beggar belief that the same thing had occurred to Ms Taleb on 4 occasions. 

10Mr Sinadinovic, who argued the case in this Court on behalf of his client, made two points in defence. The first concerned the proceedings being issued out of time. The second concerned the evidence not being capable of satisfying me beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of his client. 

11His first point rested on s 181 of the Road Transport (General) Act which provides that proceedings for an offence such as this ""may be commenced within one year after the date of the alleged commission of the offence."" The proceedings commenced on 10 February 2012. The statutory declaration was received on 10 February 2011. It appears to be common ground that if that is the case then there is no defence under s 181. However, Mr Sinadinovic argues that the offence was committed before 10 February 2011, namely on 4 February 2011 when his client completed the statutory declaration asserting that Hassan Farhat was responsible for the offence. 

12The offence, which his client has been convicted of, is created by s 179(7) of the Road Transport (General) Act. It says that a person must not ""in a relevant nomination document supplied under subsection (4), falsely nominate another person as the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence occurred."" Mr Sinadinovic's argument is that the offence was complete (if his client is guilty) when she completed the statutory declaration. He argued that the word ""supplied"", as appears in s 179(7), served as an adjective to describe the document. He argued that the offence is complete in the sense of the actus reus, once the document is signed. He argues that the offence cannot depend upon it being complete only when discovered. He referred also to part of the form of the statutory declaration warning that a person ""who makes a statement"" which they know to be false in a material particular is liable to a fine. The fine coincides with the amount specified in subsection (7). 

13I do not accept Mr Sinadinovic's argument. To my mind an element of the offence created by s 179(7) is that the document be in fact supplied to an authorised officer in accordance with subsection (4). That subsection provides that a person must supply (by effectively a statutory declaration) ""to the authorised officer...the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence occurred."" I accept Mr Hearnden's submission that the word ""supplied"" is part of the definition of the offence and it must have been in fact supplied to the authorised officer. 

14The purpose of the legislation is to enable the relevant authorities to fix liability on the person really responsible for the offence. It is not until the relevant authority is in possession of information that the authority can act. There would be little point, in my opinion, in providing in this legislation for an offence of falsely completing a document or a statutory declaration when such an offence is already dealt with in the Oaths Act 1900. The purpose, in my opinion, of the legislation - or this part of the legislation - is to enable the relevant authority to receive accurate information so that it can pursue the real offenders. In my opinion the court attendance notice was issued within time.

15Mr Sinadinovic's second point is very straightforward. He argues, in his helpful written submissions and also in his oral submissions, that there is a ""reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence"". 

16I should have added earlier that in each of the four cases, the penalty notice was paid by a person whose identity is not the subject of the evidence. Mr Hearnden's argument here relies, as I have said, on coincidence evidence. Mr Hearnden acknowledges that there are three reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence but that none of them is applicable in this case. 

17One is that the drivers had entered into Australia under another name. I am prepared to accept that that is not a reasonable hypothesis. In other words, I accept Mr Hearnden's submission because of the searches undertaken by the Government department responsible for immigration. A second possible hypothesis is that Ms Taleb had mis-recorded the information. I agree that that is not a reasonable hypothesis because of the unlikelihood of the information being mis-recorded in exactly the same way on 4 separate occasions over about 13 months. Mr Hearnden acknowledged that a third possible hypothesis which - he argued was not reasonable - was that the details given by the drivers on each occasion to Ms Taleb, were untruthful. He argued that that hypothesis was so improbable that I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it could be excluded. 

18The hypothesis as developed in argument by Mr Hearnden seemed to come down to this: 4 people on separate occasions within 13 months misled Ms Taleb by asserting that they had international licences issued in Lebanon in circumstances where none of those 4 persons had any Australian licence. 

19Mr Sinadinovic's contrary argument focussed on the terms of the offence which his client is said to have committed. What the prosecutor claimed she was guilty of was falsely nominating another person as the one who was in charge of her car at the time. Mr Sinadinovic argued that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when his client nominated Hassan Farhat on 4 February 2011 in her statutory declaration as the driver of her car when the offence occurred, that she was falsely nominating another person. 

20There is, Mr Sinadinovic argued, a reasonable possibility that Hassan Farhat exists and was driving his client's car at the relevant time so that her nomination of him was not false. An important aspect of his argument is this. The searches undertaken by the State Debt Recovery Office did not include checking whether in this case Hassan Farhat lived at 44 Preddys Road, Bexley. In other words, Mr Sinadinovic argues there has not been excluded the reasonable possibility that if someone went and knocked on the door at 44 Preddys Road, Bexley they may well find that Hassan Farhat lives there. 

21I think there is a good deal of force in that argument. The force is somewhat reduced by the assertions on three previous occasions that a person with an international licence issued in Lebanon drove his client's car. However, given the state of the evidence I do not regard the possibility advanced by Mr Sinadinovic as far fetched or unreasonable. Three of the persons nominated in the forms were said to live at 44 Preddys Road, Bexley. As I said, one of them is nominated living in Carlton. 

22To my mind, the reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence is that Ms Taleb was happy to lend her cars to other people. If they committed regulatory offences, then she would expect that they would pay the fines. As it happened, 4 offences were committed within about 13 months. That is not an unreasonable assumption or an unreasonable scenario because it may be that Ms Taleb regularly lent her car to others. It may be that three of the persons she lent the cars to lived at 44 Preddys Road, Bexley. That has not been excluded as a reasonable possibility because no searches have been undertaken as to whether persons of that name may have lived at that address.

23What is rather extraordinary, and nearly tips the balance against his client, is that none of the persons to whom she lent the car - in the reasonable hypothesis scenario - had any form of contact with Australian traffic authorities. They were all unlicensed. But of course, it may be that that was why they wanted to borrow somebody else's car. I do not regard the fact that the immigration authorities do not disclose any of the persons entering or leaving Australia within the relevant time, as being of great significance. It could be that all of the persons were born in Australia, had the names ascribed by Ms Taleb, lived at those addresses but lied to her about having international licences issued in Lebanon. 

24The extraordinary thing, I repeat, is that none of them had any contact with the traffic authorities. But the important thing, Mr Sinadinovic emphasised more than once, was to focus on the question whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his client, in completing the form on 4 February 2011, falsely nominated Hassan Farhat as the person who was driving her car through the Cross City Tunnel on 24 December 2010. 

25The reasonable possibility that that assertion was true has not, in my opinion, been excluded by the prosecutor and I would therefore acquit Ms Taleb of the offence. In terms of the legislation governing the appeal, under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine this appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction.

26I should add finally that I have been greatly assisted by both Mr Hearnden and Mr Sinadinovic in their careful, helpful and fair submissions.

HIS HONOUR: I am going to add now that it is 4.35pm. The court officer has been here 35 minutes beyond what he expected and so has the monitor, whom we cannot see, and I appreciate that. It has enabled me to dispose of this case which was not straightforward.

HEARNDEN: Your Honour could I hand back the file?

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Hearnden and the exhibits A to F and the two MFI's will go onto the Court file. Again gentlemen, thank you for your assistance.

		13 March 2013",2012-10-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760268,SD v NSW Crime Commission [2012] NSWSC 1642,"Judgment
Introduction
1By summons filed on 16 August 2012 the plaintiff applies for a review by this Court, pursuant to s 19(2) of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 (the Act), of the decision by the New South Wales Commission (the Commission) that the plaintiff is not entitled to refuse to answer questions put to him during an examination hearing on 15 August 2012 The Court is empowered by s 19(4) to affirm, or set aside, the decision.
The background to the plaintiff's application
2The evidence comprised a statement of agreed facts as to the background to the examination of the plaintiff by the Commission. It is not necessary to reproduce the statement in full. The following summary is sufficient to deal with the matter in issue.
3Shootings occurred in Greenfield Park in January 2012. It was alleged that shots had been fired both from, and in the direction of, a Toyota Corolla vehicle.
4On 9 March 2012 the police executed a search warrant at the plaintiff's residence. The warrant was granted on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the plaintiff was involved in an offence pursuant to s 33A of the Crimes Act 1900, namely discharging a loaded firearm with intent. One of the officers who executed the warrant was both a serving member of the NSW Police and a member of staff of the Commission.
5Pursuant to the warrant, the police seized various items including the vehicle alleged to be the Toyota Corolla involved in the shootings. The police informed the plaintiff that they ""consider him a suspect and that they have evidence that he was an offender"".
6On 17 July 2012, the Commission issued a summons pursuant to s 16 of the Act requiring the plaintiff to attend and give evidence before the Commission on 3 August 2012. The summons identified the general nature of the matters about which the Commission intended to question the plaintiff in the following terms:
""...knowledge of the public place shooting incidents in Greenfield Park in 2012""
7The plaintiff sought, and, on 2 August 2012, was refused, a stay of the hearing before the Commission on 3 August 2012.
8The Commission's examination of the plaintiff was adjourned to 6 August 2012. Prior to commencement of the examination, the Commissioner made a non-publication direction pursuant to s 13(9) of the Act as follows: 
""The Commission directs that any evidence given by this witness or tendered or produced in the presence of this witness or any information that might enable this witness to be identified as a person who has given evidence before the Commission shall not be published except in a manner and to such persons as the Commission may specify."" 
9Questions were then asked of and answered by the plaintiff. 
10The plaintiff, by his solicitor, Mr Miralis, sought a direction from the Commissioner prohibiting the publication of the examination transcript to members of the NSW Police or any other investigative body investigating the plaintiff with respect to the matters the Commission was inquiring about. The Commissioner declined to give such a direction.  
11On 15 August, the Commissioner directed as follows: 
""Pursuant to subsection (9) of section 13 of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 the Commission directs that any evidence given before it, the contents of any document or a description of any such thing produced to the Commission in the course of the hearing, any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the Commission, namely, [the plaintiff], to be identified or located or the fact that [the plaintiff] has given evidence at this hearing shall not be published except in such manner and to such persons as the Commission specifies...
I, ancillary to the ... direction just given, I further direct that the following classes of persons are specified as persons to whom the contents of this hearing and the identity of the witness may be published: 
(a) Dennis Miralis, Solicitor;(b) [the plaintiff] himself; (c) The persons appointed to assist the Commission in this hearing and who are present in the hearing room, of whom there are three; (d) Myself; (e) Such lawyers of the Commission employed by the Commission who have carriage of matters related to this hearing; (f) Those persons who are monitoring the audio/visual recording of the Commission and are charged with the responsibility of typing any transcript that is required of it."" 
12The plaintiff, by his solicitor, then sought an order for non-publication to the NSW Police or the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The Commissioner refused his application.
13The examination of the plaintiff proceeded further on 15 August 2012. Questions were asked about a shooting which was said to have occurred in July 2012, which the plaintiff answered. However, the plaintiff refused to answer the following two questions:
""Where were you during the evening of the 11th of January 2012?""
""The Commission has been told that you, [person 1] and [person 2] were seen in a dark blue Commodore outside that house and that two of the occupants of the vehicle discharged a total of 27 shots into the house. What do you say to that?"" 
14The Commissioner ruled that the plaintiff was required to answer these two questions. The ruling was made in the presence of the plaintiff and accordingly s 19(1)(c) of the Act was engaged.
15The plaintiff contended that he was entitled to refuse to answer the questions on the following grounds:
(1)he was a person who may be charged with offences relating to shooting incidents on 11 January 2012 and 12 July 2012; 
(2)no irrevocable non-publication order was made prohibiting the publication of the evidence to members of the NSW Police or the DPP, or any other investigative body involved in investigating the plaintiff for the offences about which he was being questioned; and
(3)he would, accordingly, be deprived of the protections recognised in R v CB; MP v R [2011] NSWCCA 264 (CB's Case) and if he were charged, his right to a fair trial would be prejudiced.
16The Commission decided the claims were not justified and notified the plaintiff of its decisions.
17At the time of the Commission hearings, no charge had been laid against the plaintiff, and that remains the case. 
The statutory framework
18Section 6 of the Act provides in part:
""6  Principal functions of the Commission
(1) The principal functions of the Commission are: 
(a) to investigate matters relating to a relevant criminal activity referred to the Commission by the Management Committee for investigation ...""
19The Act authorises the Commission to hold hearings for the purposes of an investigation: s 13(1). Section 13(9) of the Act relevantly provides:
""(9) The Commission may direct that: 
(a) any evidence given before it,
(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the Commission or seized pursuant to a search warrant issued under section 11,
(c) any information that might enable a person who has given or may be about to give evidence before the Commission to be identified or located, or
(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing,
shall not be published, or shall not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the Commission specifies, and the Commission shall give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.""
[Emphasis added.]
20The Commission accepted for the purposes of the hearing that the plaintiff was a person who ""may be charged"" with an offence within the meaning of s 13(9) and accordingly that it was obliged to make a non-publication order so as not to prejudice any future trial that might take place.
21Section 18 of the Act relevantly provides:
""18  Failure of witnesses to attend and answer questions etc
...
(2) A person appearing as a witness at a hearing before the Commission shall not, without reasonable excuse or except as provided by section 18A or 18B:
...
(b) refuse or fail to answer a question that the person is required to answer by the member presiding at the hearing, or
...
Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.""
22Section 18B of the Act relevantly provides:
""18B  Privilege concerning answers and documents
(1) A witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission at a hearing is not (except as provided by section 18A) excused from answering any question or producing any document or thing on the ground that the answer or production may incriminate or tend to incriminate the witness, or on any other ground of privilege, or on the ground of a duty of secrecy or other restriction on disclosure, or on any other ground.
(2) An answer made, or document or thing produced, by a witness at a hearing before the Commission is not (except as otherwise provided in this section) admissible in evidence against the person in any civil or criminal proceedings or in any disciplinary proceedings.""
23 Section 19 relevantly provides:
""19   Applications to Supreme Court
(1) Where: 
...
(c) a person claims to be entitled to refuse to answer a question put to the person, or to produce a document that the person was required to produce, at a hearing before the Commission,
the Commission shall decide as soon as practicable whether in its opinion the claim is justified and notify the person of its decision.
(2) If the person is dissatisfied with the decision, the person may apply to the Supreme Court for an order of review in respect of the decision.
...
(4) On an application for an order of review in respect of a decision of the Commission under subsection (1), the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, make an order:
(a)  affirming the decision, or
(b)  setting aside the decision...""
The issues to be determined
The nature of this Court's jurisdiction
24The plaintiff's primary submission was that the jurisdiction of this Court to review the decision of the Commission that the plaintiff was not entitled to refuse to answer the questions is a review on the merits and that no error need be shown. The plaintiff emphasised the word ""discretion"" in s 19(4) in support of his contention that the power of this Court is not confined to judicial review of an administrative decision on the basis of error. The plaintiff contended that the point had not been regarded as authoritatively determined by Ganin v NSW Crime Commission (1993) 32 NSWLR 423.
25The plaintiff relied on the following passage from Z v NSW Crime Commission (No 2) [2005] NSWSC 1388 at [34]-[36], per Johnson J:
""Section 19(4) enables the Supreme Court 'in its discretion', to make an order affirming or setting aside the decision of the Commission. The statutory reference to the Court exercising a discretion in this respect tends to support the view that the function being carried out by the Court is not a narrow one. Likewise, the observation of Kirby P in Ganin, above, that the Court may consider whether the person had a 'reasonable excuse' at the time when the person appeared before the Commission, whether that head of 'reasonable excuse' was advanced at that time or not.
In the event, I do not consider that it is necessary to explore this question further to determine the present application. The only evidence which is before me is the material which was before the Commission at the time when it made its decisions on 2 February 2005. There is no additional evidence from the Plaintiff. The arguments which have been advanced to this Court as to 'reasonable excuse' involve the same heads of claim as those made before the Commission on 2 February 2005, although more elaborate legal argument has occurred both in writing and orally before me.
In the circumstances of this case, the function which I am undertaking under s 19(4) NSWCC Act will require a decision, on the material before me, as to whether the Plaintiff had a 'reasonable excuse' for the purposes of the NSWCC Act, on the grounds advanced before me, which entitled him to refuse to answer the questions put to him on 2 February 2005.""
26The defendant submitted it had been authoritatively that these proceedings do not constitute a merits review by reason of what the Court of Appeal said in Ganin at 439, per Kirby P, Meagher JA and O'Keefe AJA agreeing.
27The defendant submitted that the words ""reasonable excuse"" were apt to include an objection on the grounds of relevance, such as for example would occur if a question were asked, the answer to which could not be regarded as ""relating to a relevant criminal activity referred to the Commission by the Management Committee for investigation"" within the meaning of s 6 of the Act. The defendant also submitted that an examinee could also have a ""reasonable excuse"" for refusing to answer a question or providing information or documents if to do so would be oppressive. As another example of a ""reasonable excuse"", the defendant instanced a question being asked after proceedings had already been commenced in circumstances which would amount to an abuse of process.
28The precise ambit of this Court's jurisdiction under s 19 of the Act does not fall for determination in the instant case. Nonetheless, the fact that this Court is empowered only to make either an order affirming, or setting aside, the decision, provides a powerful indication against merits review.
29In any event, the basis on which the plaintiff contends that he had a reasonable excuse for refusing to answer the two questions was that the requirement to answer them infringed his privilege against self-incrimination because there was no safeguard to protect him against derivative use of the answers. This raises a matter of law. If legal error be found, then the decision to require the plaintiff to answer the questions ought be set aside. Whether the derivative use immunity has been abrogated by the Act is a matter of statutory construction and will be considered further below.
Whether the Commission's decision was erroneous
30The plaintiff submitted that once he had been identified as a suspect, he ought to have been charged with an offence or offences and brought to trial. He contended that in circumstances where the evidence that the plaintiff was an offender was available by 9 March 2012 when the search warrant was executed, it was illegitimate for the Commission to require the plaintiff to answer the two questions objected to when the evident purpose of at least the second of the two questions was to obtain an admission from the plaintiff as to his commission of an offence, rather than to investigate the commission of an offence.
31The plaintiff further submitted that the dual status of the police officer who executed the search warrant as a member of the NSW Police and an officer of the Commission indicated the need for the more expansive non-publication order sought by the plaintiff at the hearing. He submitted that the officer would have been obliged to inform the NSW Police of the results of the warrant as part of his duties.
32The plaintiff submitted that unless an irrevocable non-publication order was made preventing the Commission from disclosing his answers to the NSW Police and the DPP, his right to a fair trial would be irremediably prejudiced. This prejudice would arise, according to the plaintiff, because the prosecuting authorities would have access to potentially incriminating answers and could use them derivatively in the prosecution of the plaintiff.
33The plaintiff contended that protection from derivative use of incriminating answers was as much part of the privilege against self-incrimination as protection from direct use of incriminating answers.  He submitted that although his answers could not be tendered in any proceedings, by reason of the prohibition in s 18B(2), this was not sufficient to protect him from their derivative use by the NSW Police or the DPP. He referred to legislation in other jurisdictions where a different approach had been taken to the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination to the one taken by the Act.
34The Commission submitted that this Court ought not engage in speculation as to what might transpire if and when the plaintiff is charged and if and when the plaintiff faces a criminal trial for offences covered by the Commission's investigation. It submitted that there is no present question as to any interference with the administration of justice since that stage has not been reached, and may never be reached. The Commission distinguished R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2012] NSWSC 934 and CB's Case on the basis that those cases considered situations whether the relevant person had already been charged.
35The Commission submitted that the question whether the plaintiff had a ""reasonable excuse"" turned on whether Parliament can be taken to have abrogated the privilege against self-incrimination except in so far as the direct use of incriminating answers is concerned. It submitted that s 18B(1) abrogated all aspects of the privilege against self-incrimination but that s 18B(2) restored a right to the examinee not to have his or her answers tendered in evidence against him or her.
36The Commission relied on Sorby v Commonwealth [1983] HCA 10; 152 CLR 281 (Sorby), in which the High Court considered provisions in the Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth). Section 5(1) of this Act provided that any person served with a summons who fails without reasonable excuse to attend shall be guilty of an offence. ""Reasonable excuse"" was defined by reference to what would amount to the same in a court of law. Section 6 provided that a witness who was summonsed to appear before the Royal Commission and who refused to answer a question was guilty of an offence. Section 6DD provided that a statement made by a witness is not admissible in evidence against the witness in any civil or criminal proceedings in any court. Gibbs CJ said, at 295:
""... in my opinion, the presence of s 6DD in the Royal Commissions Act 1902 was not sufficient to reveal a clear intention to enact that a witness called before a Royal Commission should not be entitled to refuse to answer questions on the ground that the answers might tend to incriminate him. I therefore hold that in September and October 1982, when the plaintiffs were called before the Commissioner, they were entitled to refuse to answer questions put to them under the Royal Commissions Act 1902 if they had reasonable ground to apprehend danger of incrimination if the questions were answered."" 
37The Royal Commissions Act 1902 was amended and a new s 6A was added in the following relevant terms:
""(1) It is not a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-section 3(2) for a person to refuse or fail to produce a document or other thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before a Commission that the production of the document or other thing might tend to incriminate him.
(2) A person is not entitled to refuse or fail to answer a question that he is required to answer by a member of a Commission on the ground that the answer to the question might tend to incriminate him.""
38Of the new provision, s 6A, Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ relevantly agreed, at 305) said, at 296:
""There cannot be the slightest doubt that s 6A of the Royal Commissions Act 1902 as amended (if valid) has the effect that a witness before a Royal Commission conducted under that Act is bound to answer questions if required to do so by a member of the Commission, notwithstanding that his answers might tend to expose him to a criminal charge.""
39Their Honours also considered the material provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1950 (Qld) which relevantly provided some protection to a witness who may incriminate himself in answer to a question by rendering his answer inadmissible as evidence against him in civil or criminal proceedings. The High Court observed that such a provision does not provide protection which is co-extensive with the protection given to him by the privilege. Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ said, at 310:
""This is because the privilege protects the witness not only from incriminating himself directly under a compulsory process, but also from making a disclosure which may lead to incrimination or to the discovery of real evidence of an incriminating character.""
40Sorby has the effect that the proper construction of s 18 and s 18B of the Act is as follows. Section 18B(1) abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination. Section 18(2) restores some protection to a witness from direct use of the witness's answers. It does not, however, prevent or provide any protection against derivative use of the answers obtained under compulsion.
41Parliament has, by enacting these sections, made a similar judgment as was made when enacting s 541 of the Companies (NSW) Code, which was considered in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; 166 CLR 486. Mason CJ said, at 496:
""Of course the section gives no protection to the witness against the use in criminal proceedings of derivative evidence, that is, evidence which is obtained from other sources in consequence of answers given by the witness in his examination... by enacting s 541 without providing such specific protection, Parliament has made its legislative judgment that such action is not required and has limited specific protection to the possible consequences of direct use in evidence of the answers of the witness, thereby guarding against the possibility that the witness will convict himself out his own mouth - the principal matter to which the privilege is directed.""
42Although there are circumstances, which need not presently be envisaged, where the consequence of the Commission's powers might be to affect the conduct of a criminal trial and whether it can proceed, this does not provide a reasonable excuse to an examinee who has not yet been charged for refusing to answer a relevant question put by the Commissioner on behalf of the Commission on the ground that it might tend to incriminate him.
43In Australian Crime Commission v OK [2010] FCAFC 61; 268 ALR 281, the Court was considering an application to restrain the conduct of the Australian Crime Commission (the ACC) rather than a stay of a criminal prosecution. By majority (Emmett and Jacobsen JJ), the Court concluded that the ACC Act permitted an examination to continue on a subject matter directly related to a pending criminal charge so long as the protective prohibitions contemplated by s 25A(3) and s 25A(9) were put in place. Section 25A relevantly provided:
""Persons present at examination
...
(3) An examination before an examiner must be held in private and the examiner may give directions as to the persons who may be present during the examination or a part of the examination.
...
(9) An examiner may direct that:
(a) any evidence given before the examiner; or
(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or
(c) any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or
(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;
must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.""
44In CB's Case, CB and MP were charged with conspiracy to manufacture drugs and MP was also charged with conspiracy to import drugs. Some months after he was charged, CB was examined before the ACC. A transcript of the examination was taken but it was not provided to the DPP. Both CB and MP sought a permanent stay of the charges. The judge at first instance granted a stay in respect of CB but refused one in respect of MP. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the stay. It followed the majority in Australian Crime Commission v OK and considered that since appropriate directions as to confidentiality had been made in relation to the examination of CB:
""he was effectively immunised from any direct or derivative use of the contents of his examination in his pending trial."" (at [110])
45The Court of Criminal Appeal said further:
""Provided the knowledge of the proceedings in the Commission are adequately protected an accused person's entitlement to a fair trial in accordance with the adversarial process will be ensured. The situation is no different whether at the time of the Commission hearing a charge has not been laid or the criminal process has commenced. The right to a fair trial will only be compromised if information relevant to a person's defence in any form, including any derivative information, is available to the prosecution.""
46It does not, in my view, follow from the fact that one of the officers who executed the search warrant was at the time both an officer of the Commission and an officer of the NSW Police that there is a risk that, notwithstanding the directions made by the Commission, the plaintiff's answers on examination will be disseminated to the NSW Police. There is no evidence that any of the persons present at the plaintiff's examination have dual roles. Nor is there any evidence that the directions in their present form are inadequate to prevent information being disseminated to NSW Police.
47Furthermore there is no express provision in the Act which authorises the Commission to make an irrevocable direction. Indeed there is some indication to the contrary since the existence of such a power would appear to be at odds with the Commission's statutory function of investigating relevant criminal activity that has been referred to it: s 6(1)(a).
48If the plaintiff is eventually charged with an offence, it may be that he will have grounds to apply to a stay of proceedings on the ground that he was disadvantaged in his defence because he was required to give evidence under compulsion in the Commission or because his evidence was not in fact kept confidential from the prosecution, as occurred in R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2012] NSWSC 934.  These possibilities do not, in my view, provide this Court with a basis on which to find that the plaintiff was entitled to refuse to answer the questions to which he objected in the Commission.
Orders
49I make the following orders:
(1) The decision of the Commission made on 15 August 2012 that the plaintiff is not entitled to refuse to answer the two questions put to him to which he objected is affirmed.
(2) The summons is otherwise dismissed.
(3) Unless an application for a different order for costs is made within seven days of the date of this order, order the plaintiff to pay the Commission's costs.

2760273,Police v CW [2012] NSWChC 16,"Judgment

Reasons for Decision
1This is a case where a young person is to be sentenced, and the defence is doing everything to convince the court not to order him to serve a period of detention for breaching a suspended control order. The prosecution does not wish to be heard. As this raises some difficult points of law, I have prepared these written reasons for sentence. 

Chronology 
2CW was born on 10 September 1994. 

3On 25 November 2011 he was sentenced to a suspended control order for nine months for two offences of intimidation, and one of assault at another court. The victim was the same in each matter, being a young woman who was engaged to another man. CW was unhappy about this, and threatened her and spat on her. He pleaded guilty to this offence.

4On the same day at the same court CW was sentenced to a suspended control order for nine months for two offences of malicious damage, two offences of intimidate police, and one of assault police causing actual bodily harm, again following a plea of guilty. CW was homeless and without any form of government assistance. He was drunk and the police detained him as an intoxicated person. The police tried to find a responsible adult who would take him in, but were unsuccessful. As a last resort they decided to take him to his mother's place. When police advised CW that he was to be taken home he became abusive and threatening and spat on the upper pants and lower shirt of one of the police. His mother would not have him. He tried to run off, and there was a violent confrontation with the police. Eventually he was sprayed with OC spray and restrained. Two police were injured in the violent struggle, with Sergeant Hamilton receiving bruising to his left little finger, neck and right knee. Senior Constable Turner suffered similar injuries to her right thumb and left index finger. The malicious damage involved urination and scratched paint whilst in the dock. 

5Up until those sentences, CW had been dealt with by the Children's Court for a range of offences including possession of prohibited drugs, breaching an AVO, and goods in custody. Police had also previously cautioned CW under the Young Offenders Act 1997 for possession of a knife as well as property offences. He had not served any terms of custody. He previously completed one Youth Justice Conference. 

6On 16 April 2012 CW entered a kebab store and demanded money that he believed his girlfriend was owed. He then took $280 from the till. On 21 June 2012 when the matter first came before Ballina Local Court, he pleaded guilty to demanding property with menaces with intent to steal and larceny.

7On 1 June 2012 CW was found to be in possession of 0.62 grams of cannabis. He was arrested and taken to Byron Bay police station. He pleaded guilty to this offence on 21 June 2012 when the matter first came before Ballina Court. 

8On 2 June 2012 CW was spoken to by police about his apparent possession of alcohol. He swore at the police. The police arrested him for offensive language. There was a struggle during which Detective Tutt's wrist was bent back. Detective Tutt punched CW in the head. He was handcuffed and then made threats to the police. On 27 July 2012, CW pleaded guilty to the offences of assault police (not occasioning actual bodily harm), resist police and offensive language. 

9It is clear that these three sets of fresh offences occurred during the term of the suspended control order. 

Issues

10The defence submissions were centred on the current subjective circumstances of the young person and s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, despite contra authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cooke; Cooke v R [2007] NSWCCA 184. However, s 98 is not the key provision. The defence submissions were that there are good reasons to excuse the young persons actions given his mental health, and that there are exceptionally strong reasons that he should not be detained at this time. 

11I note that the prosecution did not wish to be heard on those submissions. 

12The issues are:
(1)What are the appropriate statutory provisions to apply
(2)What is the law with respect to adults and breaches of suspended sentences
(3)Is there a difference between the provisions for children and adults
(4)What is the test for children
(5)Applying that test to this situation
(6)The Young Offenders Act option

The Appropriate Statutory Provisions
13CW is to be sentenced under the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Suspended control orders are provided for in s 33(1B):

(1B) If the Children's Court deals with a person under subsection (1) (g), it may make an order: 
(a) suspending the execution of its order under subsection (1) (g) for a specified period (not exceeding the term of that order), and 
(b) releasing the person on condition that the person enters into a good behaviour bond under subsection (1) (b) for such a specified period, 
but only if the person is not subject to any other order under subsection (1) (g) or to any sentence of imprisonment. Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 does not apply to an order under subsection (1) (g) whose execution is suspended under this subsection. 

14Thus, the court must first 'deal' with the young person under s 33(1)(g), a control order. A court is not to sentence a young person to a control order unless it is satisfied that it would be wholly inappropriate to deal with the person by a non-custodial option: s 33(2). 

15Where a suspended control order is thought to be breached, the key provision is s 41A (my emphasis):

41 A Provisions applicable where control order suspended subject to good behaviour bond 
(1) This section applies where the Children's Court has, under section 33 (1B), suspended the execution of an order under section 33 (1) (g) and the person concerned has entered into a good behaviour bond. 
(2) Action with respect to a failure to comply with any such good behaviour bond may be taken under section 41. 
The good behaviour bond is to be terminated unless the court is satisfied that: 
(a) the person's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or 
(b) there are good reasons for excusing the person's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. 
(3) If any such good behaviour bond is terminated: 
(a) the suspension of the execution of the order under section 33 (1) (g) ceases to have effect, and 
(b) Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies to the order under section 33 (1) (g), as if the order were a sentence of imprisonment being imposed following the revocation of the good behaviour bond, and section 24 of that Act applies in relation to the setting of a non-parole period under that Part. 
(4) The conditions of any such good behaviour bond may be varied under section 40 or in proceedings taken under section 41. 

What is the law with respect to adults and breaches of suspended sentences?
16The key legislative provision is s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which is in similar but not identical terms to s 41A:

(3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in Section 12 a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied:(a) that the offender's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature or;(b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender's failure to comply with the condition of the bond.

17Guidance in the approach to be taken in relation to such a breach is found in the decisions of DPP v Cooke and Anor [2007] NSWCA 2 and DPP v Nouata [2009] NSWSC 72. The latter case is authority for the proposition that the mere fact that a section 12 bond may be near to expiry is not relevant to the exercise of discretion pursuant to s 98(3)(b). 

18In DPP v Cooke Howie J found at [12]:

...what the court is required to consider is whether there are good reasons to excuse the failure to comply with the condition of the bond in circumstances where that failure is not trivial in nature. The focus must principally be upon the behaviour giving rise to the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and whether that behaviour should be excused.

19At [15] the Court said that: 

...the subjective circumstances of an offender at the time of proceedings for revocation of the bond are irrelevant to a determination under Section 98(3)(b).

20However the Court did not close the door completely on consideration of extenuating circumstances. Howie J identified examples that might lead to such a conclusion, highlighting at [16] that: 

...if the breach is a further offence the failure to be of good behaviour might be excused because of extenuating circumstances leading to the offending behaviour.

21Howie J went on to state at [23] that: 

There is nothing more likely to bring suspended sentences into disrepute than the failure of the courts to act where there has been a clear breach of the conditions of the bond by which the offender avoided being sent to prison...if offenders do not treat the obligations imposed upon them by the bond seriously and if the courts are not rigorous in revoking the bond upon breach in the usual case, both the offenders and the public in general will treat them as being nothing more than a legal fiction designed to allow an offender to escape the punishment that he or she rightly deserved.

22And further at [26]: 

... the sentence to be imposed for the offence giving rise to the breach cannot be taken into account in determining whether to revoke the bond. The penalty to be imposed for the offending behaviour is simply irrelevant to the determination of whether good reasons exist to excuse the breach.

23In R v Cooke; Cooke v R [2007] NSWCCA 184 the court considered whether any flexibility remains:

26 As a matter of practical reality the qualitative assessment of triviality under s98(3)(a) will invariably impact upon the enquiry into whether there are good reasons to excuse the offender's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond under s 98(3)(b). However, as in this case, where the failure to comply with the bonds is the commission of another and objectively more serious criminal offence that cannot on any view be regarded as trivial, it would be unusual for there to persist good reasons for excusing the failure to be of good behaviour since to make that finding on the question of revocation goes very close to excusing the commission of the offence itself. Any matters merely mitigating, as opposed to excusing the offending, can be accounted for when sentencing for the offence constituting the breach. 27 We were also invited by Ms Francis to find that the penalty imposed for the breach was disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct giving rise to it. In this regard she referred us to an approach taken to the construction of a section not dissimilar to s 98 by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320, an approach to which Hidden J referred in DPP v Burrow and Anor at [25]. In that case his Honour stated: 
[25] Where the offence is relatively minor, it might be appropriate to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond, particularly where the suspended sentence is a long one. 

One of the matters to which King CJ had regard in Marston (at 322) was the ""marked disproportion between the seriousness of the breaching offence and the length of the sentence which is activated by the revocation of the suspension"". (Of course, I am not speaking here of offences which are trivial in their nature, for which separate provision is made in para (a).)
28 In DPP v Cooke and Anor, Howie J did not consider it necessary to form a settled view on whether the approach taken in Marston should be followed when applying s 98(3)(b). We are of the same view. We also agree with his Honour's observations that even assuming that a court could take into account the impact of the revocation of the bond, it would be a rare case where it would be appropriate to do so and such a consideration should not outweigh the legislative intention that significant and relatively inexcusable breach of a s 12 bond will normally lead to its revocation. This is not such a case.

24Thus the superior courts of this state have made it clear that the subjective circumstances of an adult offender at the time of proceedings for revocation of the bond are irrelevant to a determination under s 98(3)(b). Similarly, the outcome of the breach is not a factor to be weighed in determining issues related to 'good reasons'. To the extent that the door is open to a Marston approach, it is open only a sliver. 

25I note that in reality, for adults, there are two other options where a section 12 bond has been breached. Firstly, a person in breach may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be served by Home Detention. This means that they remain at home, and are not actually imprisoned at all. Secondly, a person in breach can be sentenced to an Intensive Correction Order, a combination of home detention, supervision and community service. Again, no prison. Although as a question of law these are deemed to be terms of imprisonment, as a question of practical reality, they do not involve any time behind bars. The sword of Damocles is not particularly sharp except by way of a legal fiction if these options are exercised. 

26Indeed, that was clearly within the contemplation of Howie J in DPP v Cooke (at [20]):

...the impact of the revocation of the bond can be ameliorated in this State by ordering that the sentence that is enlivened by the breach be served by periodic detention or home detention.

27Periodic Detention has been abolished, and replaced with Intensive Correction Orders. Parliament has determined that these 'softer' deemed imprisonment options are not available to children. If a suspended control order is breached there is no other option available except for actual time behind bars. 

Is there a difference between the provisions for children and adults?
28There are no authorities on this point. In my view, the wording of s 41A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, whilst slightly different, is not materially so. I can see no difference between the words ""must revoke"" and the words ""is to be terminated"". Both are directive.

29However, in my view there must be a reason that Parliament has chosen to place the breach section with similar wording in the Children (Criminal Proceeding) Act 1987, and not in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There are other links between the two sections, notably the mechanism for sentencing. Further, there are criminal law provisions which Parliament has elected to apply equally to adults and children - for example the Bail Act 1978. 

30It is a legal principle that legislative provisions are to be interpreted within the context of the Act in which they are placed. Further, it is a legal principle that like provisions should be interpreted in like ways. This is an example of where there is tension between these two principles. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 defines the purpose of sentencing in s 3A, only one of which is rehabilitation and the balance are: adequate punishment, deterrence, protection, accountability, denunciation and recognition of harm to the victim and the community. In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) found at [23] that the principal consideration is the adequacy of punishment: 

This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime...

31Adult sentences of imprisonment must not be imposed unless, having considered all other alternatives, no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate: s 5. This is notably less prescriptive than the ""wholly inappropriate"" test for detention of children. 

32In the case of young people, the emphasis is different. Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides that functions under the Act are to be exercised having regard to the following relevant principles: 

(b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,

(c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,

(d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,

(e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind,

(f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties,

33It is readily apparent that the statutory emphasis is on rehabilitation wherever possible, and is significantly different than those under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the common law as it applies to adults. 

34Of particular concern is subsection (e) above. If CW were an adult, he would have two key sentencing options available to him that may well result in no time behind bars. The penalty regime he is facing should the adult application of s 98 be applied to s 41A, is in reality greater than that which may be imposed on an adult. An adult's chance of being dealt with by one of these two sentencing options may well be assisted by involvement in the MERIT program. Again, this is not available to young people, and even the limited Youth Drug Court has now been abolished. This must influence the manner in which s 41A is to be interpreted, in that I must take into account subsection (e). 

35The courts have for many years found that in sentencing young people there is a greater emphasis given to rehabilitation, and less to deterrence: R v AEM Snr; KEM; MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97] and KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [22]. The latter case also considers the cognitive, emotional and psychological immaturity of young people, which often contributes to offending behaviour. There are of course cases where the 'special attention normally given to rehabilitation' must give way to punishment and deterrence, particularly for crimes of violence and crimes involving adult responsibility: R v King [2004] NSWCCA 444. 

36Given this different context, and that there is no authority to the contrary, in my view in the Children's Court it is appropriate to interpret s 41A so as to have regard to the subjective circumstances of CW in assessing the breach and its consequences. Cooke has limited application to the Children's Court. To find otherwise would necessarily put to one side the principles enunciated in the Act. If there is to be a greater emphasis on rehabilitation, keeping young people at home and at school and reintegration, it is inconceivable to treat the current circumstances of the young person as 'irrelevant'. In particular, I intend to take into account the steps that CW has taken toward rehabilitation since the date of the most recent offences, even though this would be impermissible in the adult court under the Cooke doctrine except in the rarest of cases. Further, given that the real consequences of a breach for a child is time behind bars, and it is not necessarily the case for an adult, then it is appropriate to weigh the consequences of detention with any alternative. 

37In an excellent and detailed paper prepared for the Children's Legal Service Annual Conference 2012 by Slade Howell, he refers to a decision of Cogswell SC DCJ who found that the unavailability of periodic detention or home detention for an adult in a rural area placed the case into the Cooke category of 'a rare case indeed'. In that case the court permitted itself to consider the impact of the revocation: R v Jonathon Michelin [2008] NSWDC 204 at [6].

38In my view it is unrealistic to expect children to have the same recognition of the seriousness of consequences of a breach at the time they enter the bond to be of good behaviour. Slade Howell recounts a typical albeit anecdotal reaction: 

Lawyer: OK, so you've been sentenced to a control order, but the court has suspended that order on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond to be of good behaviour and accept the supervision of Juvenile Justice -
Child: Yep. 
Lawyer: Do you have any questions about that?
Child: Yeah, just one: am I still on curfew?

What should the test be for children?
39In my view the term ""good reasons"" ought be given a wide interpretation, and all the subjective factors affecting the young person ought be taken into account. This should not be limited to those factors that existed at the time of the offence that constitutes a breach. It should extend to all matters relevant to the sentencing discretion. There may be good reasons that excuse the breach, which include the effect that a term of detention may have on future rehabilitation. 

40In other words, the question is, 'are there good reasons to excuse a child's failure to comply'?

41This of course does not mean that the suspended control order just becomes a 'legal fiction' feared by Howie J in Cooke. The presumption is that the suspension will be terminated thus resulting in a term of detention. The defence bears the burden of satisfying the court that there are good reasons for excusing the failure, and that includes the material relating to the young person's current situation. 

Applying that test to this situation
42The evidence by way of reports gives insight into CW's history. CW was sexually abused by his schizophrenic father until he was five years of age. This has not been addressed through counselling. CW's relationship with his mother has been characterized by conflict resulting in several apprehended violence orders and breaches related to the dysfunctional nature of their relationship. CW's mother has refused to participate in counselling and has refused to allow CW to attend counselling. CW commenced smoking cannabis at age nine. At one stage he was smoking 50 to 100 cones per day. He also has had periods of binge drinking. 

43CW was suspended from school in 2008 for cannabis use. Up until very recently he has had very little formal education. 

44CW was removed from his mother's care by DOCS in September 2010, and a pattern of short term returns to his mother's care resumed. 

45Immediately following the most recent offences, CW formed a productive counsellor/client relationship with Jeannie O'Carroll, an experienced youth worker from the Northern Rivers Social Development Council, which has resulted in a remarkable turnaround. CW has in the space of a few short months completed a Certificate III in Horticulture, an OH & S White Card and has commenced Year 12 studies. He has obtained his own accommodation. Again due to the efforts of this youth worker, he has seen a psychiatrist, and has been placed on anti-psychotic medication, which has reportedly made him calmer and more focussed. He has been regularly seeing a drug and alcohol counsellor. CW is now undertaking work experience on a macadamia farm with favourable feedback. 

46The Juvenile Justice report is favourable:

He presents as a very disturbed young person with a history of childhood abuse and family conflict...Previous attempts at intervention have had little success but his successful engagement with the SWITCH program has seen CW obtain and maintain independent accommodation and attend training and work experience.

47Jeannie O'Carroll has written a detailed and helpful report, which gives great hope that with appropriate ongoing support CW has genuine prospects for the future. It is clear that CW trusts Ms O'Carroll and through her intervention is dealing with his past through a variety of therapeutic interventions. She associates the most recent offences as occurring during periods of disturbance, homelessness and turmoil. 

48Dr Foy, a psychiatrist, reports that CW has delusions and is thought disordered. His presentation is consistent with a psychotic illness. He has previously lacked insight into his illness and his need for treatment. 

49In the light of the above, it is clear that the offences were committed during periods of homelessness and most likely a degree of psychosis. The offences breaching the bond are not trivial, and nor can they accurately be described as minor. Since the offences, there has been a fragile but discernable improvement with which I am reluctant to interfere. CW has a supportive team of professionals around him, is taking medication and has pride in his recent educational, employment and accommodation achievements. There are good reasons to excuse CW's conduct, and it would be a tragedy to interrupt this tentative progress with a control order. 

The Young Offenders Act option
50Ms Barker for CW indicated that he was very keen to go through a Youth Justice Conference. In particular, CW is concerned that the victim of the money stealing matter must have been frightened, and he wishes to make amends with her. He also would like better relations with the local police, and an opportunity to show them that he has turned over a new leaf and is able to apologise for his actions. The prosecution does not oppose this course with respect to the assault police matters. 

51In my view the assault police matters ought be dealt with by Youth Justice Conference. This would pay service to s 6(g) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, as well as s 7(a), (e) and (g), and s 34 of the Young Offenders Act 1997. The result of these matters being referred for Youth Justice Conference would be, subject to the outcome plan being approved and completed, a dismissal of the charges: s 57 of the Young Offenders Act 1997.

52Of course this does not, of itself, solve the problem of the suspended control order. Arguably, the dismissal under the Young Offenders Act 1997 does not relieve the court of the obligations under s 41A because CW has not been of 'good behaviour'. The dismissal is not the same, for example, as a dismissal after a defendant hearing, or a determination under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. However, it would add to the reasons for excusing the conduct, given constructive participation in the conference and outcome plan process.

53I agree with the prosecution submissions that the demand money matters ought not be referred to Youth Justice Conferencing for the reasons submitted by Ms Kennedy. The demand money and cannabis matters will be dealt with by way of probation pursuant to s 33(1)(e) for a period of 12 months. Further supervision is appropriate. 

Orders

54I refer the assault police matters to Youth Justice Conferencing. Should CW complete the conference and outcome plans then those matters will be dismissed. He is excused from attending on future occasions (unless otherwise advised) if legally represented. Bail is dispensed with on those matters. 

55I take no action on the breach of the suspended control orders for the reasons given above.

2760279,R v Venios [2012] NSWDC 270,"sentence


1HIS HONOUR: When I sentenced Mervyn Joseph Hickey in May this year I was concerned about the circumstance that I was not sentencing him at the time as his co-offender Mr Venios. The evidence adduced in Mr Hickey's case was that he was the junior partner and that Mr Venios was the person who had led him astray.

2I said this, ""Should Mr Venios ever be sentenced for his part I have little doubt that he will claim that he was led into his involvement by Mr Hickey."" What I predicted has proved to be accurate. Mr Venios, in evidence today, blamed Mr Hickey for leading him astray. I begin these remarks on sentence that way not to suggest that I will sentence Mr Venios on the basis that he was more heavily involved than Mr Hickey, but to demonstrate yet again the importance of co-offenders being dealt with at the same time 

3It was my decision earlier this year to deal with Mr Hickey when I did because at that stage Mr Venios' matter was still in the Local Court and he had not even entered a plea. The result is that I will be sentencing two people on the basis that each of them was less involved than the other. I apologise to Ms McCaffery for this. It is a circumstance that occurs too often in the criminal courts of this State. It is difficult to explain to Ms McCaffery and others why things are done that way. It is nevertheless the ways things have turned out in this case.

4I sentenced Mr Hickey to gaol for six years with a three year non-parole period. That is enough to indicate the objective seriousness of the offence that he committed with Mr Venios. What they did was this. Ms McCaffery was gambling on the poker machines at her local hotel. She had the fortune, or as it turned out probably the misfortune, to win a jackpot. She celebrated with other pub patrons, and was generous in buying them all drinks. She collected her winnings in cash. As the money was handed over, she was watched by Mr Venios. He had come to the pub to drop off his partner and stayed. 

5He was associating at that time with Mr Hickey. Mr Hickey decided that he would rob Ms McCaffery. Mr Venios went along with it. Mr Venios claims that his thinking was somewhat disturbed because of his drug addiction and from the drugs that he had taken that day but it was not so disturbed that he was not able to plan the robbery of Ms McCaffery and put that plan into effect.

6Nicer patrons of the hotel, concerned for Ms McCaffery's welfare, escorted her home. Mr Venios and Mr Hickey watched as that occurred, planning to rob Ms McCaffery as soon as she was alone. Ms McCaffery suffers from difficulties with her eyesight. She wears thick prescription glasses. She was wearing those when the money was handed over to her when Mr Venios was nearby.

7Mr Venios claims that he did not know of Ms McCaffery's problems with her eyesight. It probably does not matter that much because he was certainly aware that she was vulnerable. He believed that she was intoxicated as she walked home and as I have said he and Mr Hickey waited until she was alone. She was thus, as Mr Venios well knew, very vulnerable, even if he may not have known that part of that vulnerability extended to her being unable to see things very well. 

8Once Ms McCaffery arrived home, the two men forced their way inside. Mr Hickey straddled her and removed money from her pockets, whilst Mr Venios stood by waiting. Mr Venios does not get much credit for the fact that it was not he who actually assaulted Ms McCaffery. Both of them had their roles to play in this robbery; one to do the actual work of removing the money from Ms McCaffery's pockets and the other to stand guard. This was a joint criminal enterprise where they each had their role and performed it.

9The harm that Ms McCaffery suffered was significant. Not surprisingly, she has been deeply affected by the experience. Part of the harm she has suffered results from the fact that she had earlier been the victim of an even more serious offence, so this attack by the two offenders, Venios and Hickey, compounded the experience of having been the victim of that earlier, more serious offence. 

10Mr Venios then went away and spent his money on drugs. He was arrested by the police and falsely denied that he was involved in the offence, and when he was shown CCTV footage of him committing the offence, denied that it was him. He gave evidence today that he was remorseful but that those feelings of remorse obviously did not come upon him until after he had been in custody for a while and had come down off the drugs that he was using.

11After two weeks in custody he was granted bail on condition that he attend a residential rehabilitation program. One of the things that Ms Goodwin will ultimately rely on is what she called 'quasi custody' through the offender being required to stay at the residential rehabilitation program.

12Submissions to that effect are often made and usually accepted. In this case however I learned a bit about the conditions of the residential requirement. Mr Venios was able to leave on weekend leave, and spent another day during the week absent from the program. The impact of that form of quasi custody on the sentence that I will ultimately impose on Mr Venios is significantly reduced. Indeed, it was on one of his permitted absences from the program that he got drunk, in breach of the rules of course, fell over, and broke his arm. It was that injury that alerted staff at the program to his intoxication.

13It was for that reason, as well as for another reason that I will shortly describe, that he was discharged from the program relatively recently, on 25 September. The other reason for discharge is that, in breach of rules that he was fully aware of at the time that he entered the program, he formed a relationship with another person at the program. That relationship continues to this day. 

14In circumstances where Mr Venios must have known that he was facing a full-time gaol sentence and that one of the things that might be used to argue that he should not be returned to gaol, was successful completion of a residential rehabilitation program, his decision to breach the rules in those two ways is difficult to understand. The idea that he cannot comply with rules of a residential rehabilitation program speaks in a significant way as to the prospects of him rehabilitating himself.

15I note, however, that the offender has no other criminal history. He is now twenty-one years of age and has in the past been able to work. It was his use of drugs, starting with ecstasy and then moving to ice and cocaine, which led to him working less, and ultimately led to this offence. 

16Were I to sentence Mr Venios today I have little doubt that he would be going back to gaol. He has not, to my mind, demonstrated rehabilitation. What I am concerned about is not so much whether he drinks or not, and even whether he uses drugs or not. That is not of any great moment to me. What I am concerned about is the prospect that he will commit further offences, perhaps while drunk, perhaps as a means of getting his drugs. To put matters bluntly, I do not care really how much he harms himself. What I do care about is whether he will harm others in the community as he has harmed Ms McCaffery.

17Ultimately the main purpose in sentencing is to protect the community and to protect its members from criminal offending. Sometimes that is achieved by the imposition of harsh sentences. On other occasions that is achieved by promoting the rehabilitation of an offender. If, through a Court order, an offender can move from being a person who harms the community by committing offences, to become a person who is productive and worthwhile and most importantly does not harm people by committing offences, then that is a good result.

18Sometimes, as I have said, protection of the community is best achieved by harsh sentences of imprisonment. But that is not always the case. There are some prospects for Mr Venios' rehabilitation. If he is able to demonstrate rehabilitation then that will be an important matter in me deciding, firstly whether to send him back to gaol and secondly, if I do, how long the sentence should be and thirdly, if I do not, what other form of punishment should be imposed upon him. I therefore will be adjourning this matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to 31 May 2013. 

19This will enable Mr Venios to demonstrate to me things he has not yet demonstrated. The gravity of this crime, as is obvious, is enormous, and many in the community - and I am sure Ms McCaffery is one of them - would be thinking that it could only be dealt with by way of a full-time custodial sentence.

20That may well eventuate but I would like to have further information as to Mr Venios' prospects of rehabilitation, as to whether Mr Venios has demonstrated rehabilitation, before I decide on the appropriate sentence.

21The conditions of Mr Venios' remand are these; he is to use no drugs. He is, at his own expense, to arrange urinalysis at least twice a month in order to prove that he is not using drugs. He is to be of good behaviour. He is to make substantial efforts to obtain employment. If he succeeds in getting a job he is not to leave that job voluntarily unless in the most extreme circumstances.

22He is not to approach Ms McCaffery and should there occur a circumstance where Mr Venios finds himself in the same location as Ms McCaffery he is to immediately leave. 

23He is to appear before me on 31 May next year when I will sentence him. I will order a pre-sentence report for that occasion.

24I request a report from the Salvation Army as to Mr Venios' recent stay and any future rehabilitation he may undertake with them. 

25Mr Venios, you more than most, have a lot of work to do. It is in your interests to come back before me on the next occasion, if I can put it this way, with an A grade pass in everything you have done. Some other people who have committed less serious offences might get away with a little bit of rehabilitation. You unfortunately do not have that luxury because your offence was so serious what you have to do now is, as I have said, an A grade pass in everything you do. Do you understand that? 

26OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

27HIS HONOUR: And that includes getting a job, keeping a job, it includes studying if you need to, it certainly includes not using any drugs. If there is the slightest problem in any way with any of those conditions of bail there will be only one result, an immediate and inevitable result and that is that you will be going to gaol for a long time. Do you understand that?

28OFFENDER: Yes.

2760282,R v BUGMY [2012] NSWCCA 223,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:Offences and sentenceOn 17 May 2011 the respondent pleaded guilty to the following charges:
(i) That on 8 January 2011 at Broken Hill did assault Steven Pitt, a Corrective Services Officer, while in the execution of his duty, contrary to s60A(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.
(ii) That on 8 January 2011 at Broken Hill did assault John Donnelly, a Corrective Services Officer, while in the execution of his duty, contrary to s60A(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.
(iii) That on 8 January 2011 at Broken Hill did cause grievous bodily harm to Jason Gould with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years and which has a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
2On 16 February 2012 the respondent was sentenced by Lerve ADCJ as follows:Counts 1 and 2 - Imprisonment for a fixed term of 8 months to commence on 8 January 2011 and expire on 7 September 2011.
Count 3 - Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on 8 April 2011 and expire 7 April 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 7 April 2017.
The effect of the sentence was a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 2 years.  
3The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against that sentence, pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the following grounds:
(1) His Honour failed to properly determine the objective seriousness of the offence.
(2) His Honour failed to properly acknowledge the category of the victim as a serving Prison Officer in the lawful performance of his duties.
(3) The weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
(4) The total sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
Factual Background
4A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered by the Crown and became part of exhibit A.  The following is taken from that Statement of Facts.
5The victim in relation to count 3, Officer Gould, was aged 43 and was a Senior Correctional Officer at the Broken Hill Correctional Centre at the time of the offence.  He had worked there for 11 years.  At that time, the respondent was an inmate of the Correctional Centre, having been remanded in custody on 2 November 2010 with respect to three charges of assault police, two of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty, escape from police custody, intimidate police and causing malicious damage by fire.  He was aged 29.
6Officer Gould's attention was drawn to the respondent when he heard him abusing Officer Caldwell.  When Officer Gould asked the respondent what the problem was, he demanded that gaol visiting hours be extended because his visitors would not arrive before 1pm, after which time visitors were not allowed entry.  Officer Gould undertook to make an inquiry of a senior officer to see whether the hours could be extended.
7Shortly thereafter, the respondent entered the wing office where Officers Gould and Caldwell were standing.  The respondent's presence in that office was prohibited.  The respondent offered to fight Officer Gould and made various threats to him including ""I'll split you open you cunt"".  Officer Gould, fearing a security incident, advised Assistant Superintendent Pitt who was his superior, that the Emergency Team might be required to attend his location.  The respondent then left the office and walked into the exercise yard.
8Some minutes later, A/S Pitt, the victim in respect of count 1, attended the wing.  He and Officer Donnelly, the victim in respect of count 2, went into the yard to speak to the respondent, who was speaking on a telephone.  That telephone call was recorded and in it the respondent told his girlfriend that he would ""split Gould open"".  
9After the respondent had finished his call, A/S Pitt asked ""How did you go?"" to which the respondent replied ""That cocksucker, I'll get him"".  A/S Pitt said ""No, I'm talking about your phone call, how did it go?""  The respondent replied ""Come on, you want a piece of me I'll split you cunts"".  The respondent ran to a nearby pool table and took a number of pool balls in his hands.
10He then threw two pool balls at A/S Pitt and Officer Donnelly, one of which narrowly missed A/S Pitt.  The respondent yelled ""Come on cunts, I'll split youse"".  (These were the facts which gave rise to Counts 1 and 2.)
11A/S Pitt and Officer Donnelly called for assistance on the radio.  Officer Gould went into the yard and saw thrown pool balls coming from the direction of a gateway.  The respondent came into view and began throwing pool balls towards Officer Gould.  The respondent said ""Gould you cunt, I told you I'm going to split you open"".  He then threw two balls at Officer Gould, both of which struck him on the back.  The respondent ran some metres into the yard.
12Officer Gould retreated into the wing office with other officers.  As he attempted to secure the office door, the respondent threw two pool balls at him, one of which struck him in the left eye causing serious injuries to his eye.  (These were the facts which gave rise to count 3.)
13The respondent continued to throw pool balls towards the correctional officers, before climbing onto the gymnasium roof carrying a number of pool balls.  Although he continued to throw balls towards the officers, none of them struck anyone.  Following negotiations, he came down from the roof and surrendered.  After doing so, the respondent expressed ""some joy"" that Officer Gould was injured.  The respondent said that he ""had not finished with Gould"".
14Officer Gould sustained a serious eye injury, including retinal detachment and orbital (eye socket) fractures.  Officer Gould underwent a number of significant operative procedures.  Although the bony structures around the eye were repaired by the use of bone grafts and a metal plate, the doctors were unable to save the sight in his left eye.  Officer Gould lost the sight in that eye.  It was accepted that not only did Officer Gould suffer significant physical harm, but he also suffered psychological damage, developed post traumatic stress disorder and lost his career.
15The matters for which the respondent was being held on remand were dealt with by the Dubbo Local Court on 12 March 2012.  The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 2 November 2010.  As can been seen, except for the period 2 November 2010 - 7 January 2011, that sentence was concurrent with that imposed by Lerve ADCJ, which is the subject of this appeal.  a.
Remarks on sentence
16Having reviewed the factual background, his Honour took into account as an aggravating factor pursuant to s21A(2)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that Officer Gould was a Correctional Services Officer.  His Honour also took into account as a matter of aggravation, pursuant to s21A(2)(g), that Officer Gould had suffered significant psychological injury.  His Honour took into account that the use of a pool ball as a weapon was a matter of aggravation pursuant to s21A(2)(c).  His Honour saw no difference in principle between the use of a pool ball as a weapon and a firearm or a knife.  
17In considering the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour took into account that an offence contrary to s33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 was a ""result offence"".  His Honour was mindful of what Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) said in Ciaron McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94 at [37]:
""37 Malicious wounding is principally a result offence. Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wound was inflicted, the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are irrelevant. The same can be said for an offence involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm: the more serious the harm inflicted the more serious the offence: see R v Mitchell and Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27].""
18In addition to the serious consequences of the offence, his Honour took into account that there was no provocation by Officer Gould.  His Honour noted that although there was no evidence that the respondent intended to blind Officer Gould, it was an element of the offence to which he had pleaded guilty, that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm.
19His Honour accepted that there was no planning of the offence and that the respondent had committed it on the spur of the moment in a fit of anger, when he did not get what he wanted.  His Honour assessed the matter as ""being slightly less serious than the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind"".
20His Honour summarised the respondent's criminal record which was a very poor one.  He had first come to the notice of the courts in February 1994 when he was aged 13.  Between that date and 26 June 2001 when he came before the courts as an adult, he had been convicted of numerous break, enter and steal offences; assaults; resisting police and damage to property for which he had been sentenced to control orders on a number of occasions.  
21From 26 June 2001 his offending had continued in an almost unbroken sequence until the occurrence of these offences.  The offences for which he was convicted included numerous assaults; break, enter and steal; destroy and damage property and resist police.  He received terms of imprisonment for those offences.  He had spent much of the time between 26 June 2001 and the date of these offences in custody.  His Honour took his criminal record into account as an aggravating factor, pursuant to s21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as that term was used in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 55; 66 NSWLR 48.  
22The respondent did not give evidence.  In relation to his subjective case, his Honour had before him a pre-sentence report.  It showed that he was of Aboriginal background and had been exposed to violence and alcohol abuse as a child.  He was educated to year 7 and had poor literacy and numeracy skills.   The respondent commenced using cannabis and alcohol at the age of 12 and developed a high degree of dependency on those substances.  The respondent had not done well when attending community-based drug and alcohol counselling.  He had never attended a long-term residential rehabilitation program.
23There were two reports by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, of 1 August and 11 November 2011 before his Honour.  In the report of August 2011 Dr Westmore concluded:
""Mr Bugmy is a 29 year old man who was born into a large family.  He said as a boy he was frequently in trouble and he told me that he had threatened teachers with knives.  He said he had contact with the police and was placed in boys' homes and Juvenile Justice facilities.  He witnessed domestic violence and said that his father had stabbed his mother.
Mr Bugmy has a history of alcohol abuse and substance abuse.  There was a history of head injuries as well.  He said that he was transferred from a Juvenile Justice facility to an adult prison and since the age of 18 he has not spent one birthday in the community.  He reports that he went downhill following the death of his mother six years ago, although the history would suggest that he has had very serious problems for most of his life.
...
Mr Bugmy frequently indicated that he believes his principal problem is that of alcohol abuse.  He said that he had asked for assistance on numerous occasions without success.  He said he had never attended a detoxification or rehabilitation facility.  He has very negative attitudes towards authority figures, particularly police and I suspect also prison officers.  There may be some family ""cultural issues"" which are also relevant to his negative views.
He describes auditory hallucinations, these are of uncertain origin but may be related to alcohol abuse, although that may also be less likely if he continues to have these experiences many months after he last took alcohol. ...  From a psychiatric perspective Mr Bugmy does require extended counselling for his drug and alcohol abuse problems and he needs regular psychiatric review in view of his reported ""voices"".""
24A supplementary report of November 2011 recorded psychotic symptoms which occurred in 2009, as a result of which the respondent was admitted to a psychiatric institution.  Dr Westmore set out his conclusions in the supplementary report as follows:
""He was identified in 2009 as having auditory hallucinations.  Clinical notes do not consistently refer to a definitive diagnosis but a schizophreniform illness was considered at one stage.  This refers to an illness of a schizophrenic type and, on the assumption that he has not used illicit drugs or alcohol now for an extended period, it would seem likely that his reported psychotic symptoms are of a primary psychotic origin, rather than those symptoms arising from secondary factors such as drugs or alcohol.  It is also possible that his reported psychotic symptoms occur in the context of a Depressive Disorder.""
25His Honour accepted that neither report of Dr Westmore established a link between the mental disorders and the respondent's offending behaviour.  His Honour referred to R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36]; and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  His Honour took note of what those cases said in relation to reducing the effect of general deterrence when an offender suffers from a mental illness.
26His Honour also had regard to the remarks of Wood J in R v Fernando NSWCCA (unreported, 14 March 1992) 76 A Crim R 58 and Kennedy v R [2010] NSWCCA 260 where this Court stated that sentencing decisions should recognise social disadvantage that precedes the commission of a crime.
27His Honour reached the following conclusions in relation to those matters:
""47 Mr Lawrence on behalf of the offender submits that ""significant moderation to the weight to be given to general deterrence is warranted on account of the totality of the psycho-social evidence"".  I am certainly prepared to allow some moderation to the weight to be given to general deterrence because of those issues.
...
52 Clearly the Fernando/Kennedy type issues are present in this matter, and accordingly, I will need to take them into account when considering the subjective case for the offender.
...
59 Clearly enough, in the circumstances, there is that issue of general deterrence to be considered.  However, there is also the issue of the mental health issues suffered by the offender in this matter to be considered.
...
62 Mr Lawrence submits and I agree that there should be a finding of special circumstances in this matter.  The offender is in danger of being institutionalised and there is on the medical evidence a very great need for intensive residential fulltime rehabilitation.  These factors clearly operate very much in favour of a finding of special circumstances despite the substantial criminal history of the offender.  The offender is going to require ongoing intensive and extensive supervision if he is going to rehabilitate himself from alcohol and substance abuse and remain offence free.""
28His Honour allowed a 25 percent discount for the respondent's early plea of guilty and used as his start point, imprisonment for 8 years for the offence contrary to s33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900.
The Crown AppealGround 1 - His Honour failed to properly determine the objective seriousness of the offence.Ground 2 - His Honour failed to properly acknowledge the category of the victim as a serving prison officer in the lawful performance of his duties.
29These grounds of appeal raise the same issue and can conveniently be dealt with together.  Like the other grounds of appeal, their focus is on count 3.
30When assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour expressed himself as follows:
""29 In oral submissions Mr Lawrence put that I would find that the matter is ""well below"" the mid-range of seriousness.  The Crown prosecutor in his oral submissions reminded me of the permanent nature of the injury sustained by Mr Gould and the use of the weapon, namely the pool ball.  As I understand the submissions by the Crown, it was submitted by the Crown that the matter was at or about the mid-range of seriousness for matters of this type.
30 In all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the matter falls within the range of being slightly less serious than the nominal mid-range of objective seriousness of these types of matters that come before this Court.""
31In reaching that conclusion, his Honour appears to have misunderstood the submissions of the parties.  It was conceded in oral submissions by the respondent that the injuries suffered by Officer Gould were ""somewhere between mid-range and somewhere above mid-range"" (Transcript, 15.12.11, p8).  In the respondent's written submissions, the following was said:
""52 Balancing these factors it is submitted that the Court would come to the view that the offence is properly characterised as mid-range.""
The Crown made no specific submission on this issue, other than to say in general terms that it was a serious offence.
32His Honour, of course, was not bound by the submissions of the parties and was required to make his own assessment of objective seriousness.  It is, however, somewhat disquieting that his Honour comprehensively misstated the submissions of the parties.  In view of the concession made by the respondent as to the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 3, one would have expected his Honour to provide some reasons for why he was not prepared to accept it.
33In the circumstances of this matter, the concession by the respondent was correctly made.  The offence was a serious example of offences of this kind.  Being a ""result offence"", the consequences for Officer Gould were relevant.  He suffered a significant injury to the structures surrounding his left eye, which resulted in a number of painful operations.  In addition, he developed significant post traumatic stress and psychological difficulties, lost the sight in his left eye and lost his employment.  
34The surrounding circumstances did not assist the respondent.  There was no provocation and the respondent's motivation appears to have been no more than a fit of anger brought about by a disruption of his visitation rights.  Finally, the use of a pool ball as a weapon is a significant matter of aggravation.  The lack of planning and ""spur of the moment"" nature of the offence does not greatly mitigate those factors.  
35The Crown's second ground of appeal focused upon one of the aggravating features of the offence.  It has, in my opinion, considerable force.  Whilst his Honour acknowledged the application of s21A(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in that Officer Gould was a Correctional Services Officer, thereafter that aggravating feature appears to have played no part in his reasoning.  As the authorities make clear, this was a very important matter of aggravation.  
36In Peter Schneidas (No 1) (1980) 4 A Crim R 96 at 100, Lee J (with whom Street CJ and Maxwell J agreed) said:
""The safety of prison officers lawfully carrying out their duties in a prison is a matter of prime importance to the proper administration of the prison system, and this Court cannot but view as a serious crime an unprovoked attack with a metal bar upon a prison officer.  The assault having taken place within the prison required a sentence in which the deterrent element not only in regard to the appellant but in regard to other prisoners was made manifest ...""
37In Regina v Davis (NSWCCA, unreported, 4.2.1994) Wood J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Meagher JA agreed) said:
""The maintenance of discipline within corrective institutions is a matter of very great importance.  The potential for substantial damage to public property and for serious physical harm, both to prison officers and other inmates, as a result of breaches of gaol discipline, is considerable, particularly in circumstances of unrest or dissatisfaction over matters of policy.  It is a consequence of that fact that sentences for offenders involving attacks on prison officers in the execution of their duty must involve, as a significant component, both personal and general deterrence.  Save in special circumstances, such sentences, in my view, should be accumulated upon any sentence already being served otherwise the sentences loses any sting of personal deterrence.""
38In his sentencing remarks, his Honour at no time made reference to the element of personal deterrence.  In this case, that was an important matter which required consideration.  Similarly, his Honour does not appear to have adequately appreciated the importance of general deterrence in the particular circumstances of this offence.  
39Accordingly, despite the essentially discretionary nature of an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence, I am satisfied that his Honour erred in his assessment of the offence in count 3.  These grounds of appeal have been made out.
Ground 3 - The weight his Honour afforded the respondent's subjective case impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
40The Crown submitted that the respondent's subjective case had few positive features.  It submitted that his Honour failed to take into account the absence of any contrition and remorse on the part of the respondent.  The Crown submitted that nowhere in the reports tendered on his behalf did the respondent accept responsibility for his actions, or acknowledge the injury, loss and damage which he had caused (Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [17] (Fullerton J with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreed)).  I agree with this submission.  Nowhere did his Honour refer to this.
41The Crown submitted that his Honour failed to give adequate weight to the respondent's bad criminal record.  It submitted that apart from these offences and the offences for which he was on remand, he had been convicted of more than 43 offences involving violence.  It submitted that his Honour should have given greater weight to his criminal record in the sentencing process than by simply referring to s21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
42I agree.  The sheer number of offences of violence and other offences of which the respondent had been convicted before these offences is the very circumstance which attracted the observations of the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477 where the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
""The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind."" 
43The Crown submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account the respondent's mental illness so as to reduce the weight to be given to general deterrence.  It submitted that it was conceded by the respondent that his mental illness had nothing to do with the count 3 offence.  It submitted that this was not a case where the respondent lost control of himself because of a pre-existing condition which might demonstrate a diminished capacity for self-control.  The Crown submitted that the other matters identified in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 and more recently in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 to which mental illness may give rise, did not apply here.
44I agree.  In Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreed) said:
""33 Where it is said that an offender suffers from a mental condition or disorder, this may bear upon the question of sentence in a number of different ways, depending upon the circumstances of the case. As Gleeson CJ observed in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 69, it is erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances such as a mental disorder. 

34 Court decisions in this area have identified a number of ways in which the presence of a mental condition or disorder may bear upon the question of sentence. A helpful summary of these factors appears in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]:

""Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203 ; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43]-[51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner:
· Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry at [28].
· It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50-51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].
· It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].
· It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].
· Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23]-[24].""""
45Although the above principles are relatively familiar and have been referred to and quoted in many decisions of this Court, it is useful to keep in mind the rationale behind them and the qualification by Gleeson CJ in Engert.  His Honour seemed to assume that because there was a diagnosis of mental illness, this automatically had the effect that the respondent was to some extent an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.  That was an erroneous approach.
46The rationale behind reducing the weight to be given to general and specific deterrence in the case of mental illness is clear.  If the mental illness or its symptoms were directly involved in the commission of the offence, then clearly that is a special subjective circumstance particular to the offender which would take him or her outside the general population, so that the principles of general and specific deterrence have little or no application.  Alternatively, as the Crown submitted, the nature of the mental illness may be such as to reduce an offender's ability to control his or her actions, thereby indirectly contributing to the commission of the offence.  
47Here, the mental illness identified by Dr Westmore did not give rise to such considerations, nor did it give rise to any of the other matters identified in De La Rosa.  It had nothing to do with any aspect of the offending.  To the extent that Dr Westmore made any diagnosis, it was expressed in general terms and it would involve speculation, rather than inference, to take it into account when sentencing the respondent in respect of the count 3 offence.  Because his Honour did take it into account in that way, he fell into error.
48The Crown submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account the difficult circumstances of the respondent's youth, in particular the prevalence of alcohol abuse and the lack of parental guidance.  The Crown submitted that this consideration lost much of its force when it was raised against a background of numerous previous offences.
49The Crown relied upon the observations of Hislop J (with whom Bell and Howie JJ agreed) in R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202 where his Honour said:""20 In my opinion, the applicant's subjective case is not advanced in reliance upon Fernando's case and the applicant's aboriginality.
21 In any event, it is not every case of deprivation and disadvantage suffered by an offender of aboriginal race or ancestry that calls for the special approach adopted in Fernando (see R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 102 per Howie J at [61]) and the mitigating effect of being an aboriginal person loses much of its force where the offender has committed similar serious offences in the past (see R v Drew [2000] NSWCCA 384 per Newman J at [21]).""
50I agree that with the passage of time, the extent to which social deprivation in a person's youth and background can be taken into account, must diminish.  This is particularly so when the passage of time has included substantial offending.  Nevertheless, it is still a matter of relevance which can properly be taken into account in the sentencing process.  Here, for the reasons set out in Ah-See, the extent to which his Honour could take those matters into account was limited.  They were, however, matters which were relevant to sentencing and it was not an error on his Honour's part to have regard to them.
51The relevant principle was restated in Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 by Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Kirby J agreed) as follows:
""64  As is well established, it is a primary objective of sentencing for criminal offences that the community must be protected from the commission of crimes, by deterring both the particular offender and other possible offenders - referred to as personal and general deterrence respectively. In a case of the character now before the Court, by an offender with this record, the protection of the community requires a substantial period of imprisonment. It is, however, often the case that such considerations of deterrence are properly tempered by considerations of compassion which arise when the Court is presented with information about the personal circumstances which have led an individual into a life of crime.
65  Such considerations are present in the case before the Court. The Respondent has a personal history of deprivation that is, regrettably, far too common amongst young people, particularly Aboriginal youth. 
66  The sentencing principles to be applied by a sentencing court apply in every case, irrespective of the membership of the particular offender of an ethnic or other group. Nevertheless, when imposing sentences courts must take into account, pursuant to those very principles of general application, all of the facts relevant to the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, including facts which may exist by reason of the person's membership of a particular group. (See e.g. Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 326.)
67 Aborigines who commit crimes of violence are not accorded special treatment by the imposition of lighter sentences than would otherwise be appropriate having regard to all of the relevant considerations, including the subjective features of a particular case. An offender is not entitled to any special leniency by reason of his or her Aboriginality.  The principle of equality before the law requires sentencing to occur without differentiation by reason of the offender's membership of any particular racial or ethnic group. Nevertheless, particular mitigating factors may feature more frequently in some such groups than they do in others. (See R v Fernando (1992) 72 A Crim R 58 at 62-63 as further explained in R v Hickey (NSWCCA, 27 September 1994; unreported); R v Stone (1995) 84 A Crim R 218 at 221-223; R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 esp at [29]-[33]; R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156 at [19]-[21].)""
52I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in taking into account what he described as ""Fernando considerations"" and reducing the weight to be given to general deterrence for that reason.  For the reasons already given, however, such a reduction would be modest.
Ground 4 - The total sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
53It is not necessary to deal with this ground of appeal.  Error in his Honour's sentencing process has been identified and the errors are of such a kind that it will be necessary to re-sentence the respondent.
Conclusion and re-sentencing
54Section 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that this Court, on a Crown appeal against sentence, may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as the Court considers proper.
55It follows from my findings of error in his Honour's approach to the objective seriousness of the offence and to the respondent's subjective case, that a more severe sentence should have been imposed on the respondent in respect of count 3.  Taking into account the factors to which I have referred and those referred to by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence, I am of the opinion that the respondent should be re-sentenced in respect of count 3 to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 8 April 2011 and to expire on 7 April 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to expire on 7 October 2018.
56The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) Crown appeal allowed.
(2) Confirm the sentence imposed in the District Court on 16 February2012 in respect of counts 1 and 2.
(3) Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 16 February 2012 in respect of count 3.
(4) In substitution for the sentence imposed in respect of count 3, sentence the respondent as follows:
Count 3 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years to commence 8 April 2011 and to expire 7 April 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to commence 8 April 2016 and to expire 7 October 2018.
57JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
58SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.

		18 October 2012",2012-10-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760285,R v JC [2012] NSWSC 1393,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, whom I shall call JC, has pleaded guilty of the manslaughter of the person I shall refer to as BD. The plea came late. The offender was originally charged with the murder of BD but the jury that tried her on that charge were unable to agree. On the date fixed for her retrial she pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and the Crown accepted the plea in discharge of the indictment. Both sides had indicated to the Court a few days earlier that the matter would be resolved in that way.

2At the time of BD's death he was 16 years old and the offender was 17 years old. The offender was in a domestic relationship with BD's elder brother, whom I shall call SD. They lived together in a flat. The deceased used to visit them and sometimes stayed overnight. 

3This account is adapted from a statement of agreed facts tendered on sentence. During the evening of 6 October 2010 BD, SD and the offender were in the flat. They cooked dinner. BD and SD were drinking beer but the offender did not consume alcohol. BD and SD began arguing with one another and pushing each other around. The commotion they were making disturbed the landlords of the flat, who lived close by. Between 10.00pm and 11.00pm the two were arguing in the street outside the flat. The offender was present. At about midnight the three of them were heard arguing in loud voices. Some time later the voices became louder. The offender was telling someone to get out and another voice asked where he was going to go. The offender's voice was described as very distressed and panicky. She continued to say ""get out, get out"". Doors were being closed and furniture was being moved about. One of the owners of the flat decided to call the police, but while she was doing so SD knocked at the door. He said that his brother was dying. The other owner entered the flat and saw the deceased seated on a chair, bleeding from the neck. The ambulance was called and the deceased was taken to hospital. Those having the care of him did what they could, and he survived until 14 October 2010. On that day life support systems were withdrawn and he died. 

4The deceased died as a result of a stab wound inflicted by the offender. The knife she used belonged to SD. It was a folding knife which he normally kept on his bedside table. The wound inflicted by the knife went through soft tissue for a distance of 2.4 centimetres. It produced massive bleeding. 

5The precise circumstances in which the offender stabbed the deceased are far from clear. The offender herself says that she has no memory of the events. SD says that he saw the offender hug the deceased. He, SD, then left the room and when he returned he saw that the deceased was bleeding. He did not see a knife. He did not know what knife had been used to stab the deceased. 

6A uniformed officer who attended the premises spoke to the offender. He asked her what happened and she said - 

""I am schizophrenic and I blacked out. I don't know what happened. I hate it.""

The officer cautioned the offender and she said -

""I got up from the bed and there was a knife on the floor."" 

The offender told another officer that she did not know what had happened. 

7The offender participated in a recorded interview. She said that she did not know how the deceased came to be injured. She did not have anything to say about a disturbance in the flat during the previous evening. She said that there was no party or anything of that description, that she did not know anything about any fighting in the street, that there was no one else in the flat that night. She said that she and SD went to bed between 2.00am and 3.00am and that she was woken by the deceased. She did not know what time that was. She did not know what happened after that. She had no recollection of seeing the deceased bleeding and she did not know how he came by his injuries. She doubted whether she had stabbed the deceased.

8The offender's mobile telephone records show that there were calls between the telephones of the deceased and SD up to 4.22am. The emergency call, after the stabbing of the deceased, was made at 4.36am. These text messages were sent from the offender's mobile telephone to the deceased - 

""10.34 pm - ""Where are you BRO!? We are worried! Call me NOW!!

10.41pm - ""No we do care u aint goin jail while im alive come home NOW!! We went looking for u we couldn't find u. Were are you???? Are you ok???!!!!!

10.44pm - ""(BD) its pip come to my house ok I care bout u ok""

10.47pm - ""Plz bro ok its pip I love u bro""

10.52pm - Come back bro k fuck every1 else just come bak fuck im not getting locked up 4 no 1 k come now""

10.56pm - ""Thanks (BD) u just made (SD) dump me thanks a lot""

11.01pm - ""No actually he just dumped me. im now on the street walkn past the pools. Thanks a lot. Im not ur sis anymore ask (SD) if u dnt bleve me"".

9Patterns of deposited blood show that the stabbing occurred in the lounge room of the flat close to the bedroom door. 

10The plea of guilty of manslaughter was made by the offender on the basis that her act which caused his death was unlawful and dangerous. Her plea was accepted on the same basis.

11The Court received a psychological report of Professor Susan Hayes and a background report from the Department of Juvenile Justice. It appears from this evidence that the offender had an unhappy childhood. She did not get on well at home. While she was in primary school she was found to be suffering from Crohn's Disease. The symptoms of that disorder caused her continual embarrassment and distress. She had to attend hospital frequently and missed a lot of school. She started off well in high school, but her work there soon began to deteriorate. She was then living in and out of home. She began taking alcohol and illicit drugs. It appears that when she was not at her parents' home she was living in temporary premises or on the streets. She developed bulimia. She left home altogether at fifteen and lived in a refuge. She continued to attend school intermittently. She was dismissed from the refuge because of her use of alcohol and other drugs and had to move to another refuge where she met SD. During these times she was sexually assaulted a number of times. She has had miscarriages. She developed anxiety attacks and now suffers what Professor Hayes calls Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, suffering flashbacks of frightening incidents in her past life. At some stage, exactly when is not clear, she was prescribed Seroquel, a drug used to treat psychiatric illness. In August 2009 she overdosed on Seroquel in an attempt at suicide. Two months later she was admitted to hospital with alcohol intoxication. Over the years she has harmed herself by cutting. It seems that Seroquel was still being prescribed for her at the time of the death of the deceased, hence her remark to the investigating police officer that she was schizophrenic.

12The evidence does not clearly point to a contemporary diagnosis of schizophrenia though Dr. Westmore thought she might have suffered from drug-induced psychosis. 

13By the time she killed the deceased, the offender had given up alcohol. She was craving marihuana. She was taking Seroquel. Evidence of things overheard by others shows that immediately before she stabbed the deceased the offender was angrily ordering him out of the flat. There is no reason to think that the deceased offered any violence or did anything to put the offender in fear. The offender generally liked and respected him. I do not think that the offender had reason to fear injury at the hands of the deceased. It is possible, of course, that she acted out of some unreasonable fear, stemming from her troubled psychological state, but the evidence does not justify such a finding. I accept the evidence of Professor Hayes and Dr. Westmore that when she killed the deceased the offender was probably in a dissociative state, that her acts were voluntary, and that they were not caused or influenced by the prescribed drug she had been taking.

14The offender was born in December 1992. She was almost eighteen years old when she committed the offence and is now almost twenty years old. Professor Hayes interviewed her and administered standard psychological tests. The results placed the offender in the range of average intelligence. Professor Hayes thought that in view of the offender's unfortunate history of disruptive schooling her verbal standard score in the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test was an underestimate of her true ability. Accordingly, Professor Hayes' opinion was that the offender's overall intelligence was above average.

15The offender was arrested on 7 October 2010 and charged with murder. She has been held in custody ever since. She has been detained in a Juvenile Justice Centre. She has participated in various programs, particularly those relating to recreational and gymnasium work.

16The offender's schooling in custody has been through attendance at a school held within the centre where she has been held, as well as by distance education with TAFE. She is committed to her courses and has been commended by the Principal for outstanding service to the school community. She hopes to complete a certificate in beauty therapy and wishes to find an apprenticeship or a job within the beautician or hairdressing field.

17She is well regarded by those who have the care of her. She has learned to stay out of trouble. She acts responsibly. Her family have supported her and have helped her in numerous ways during her incarceration. Her relations with her family are much better than they were during the difficult years I have spoken about.

18She has received treatment for bulimia. 

19Professor Hayes considers that the offender is articulate in her description of her past and present situation and has good insight into her circumstances. Professor Hayes considers that the offender will benefit from counselling and psychotherapy and has good prospects of remaining abstinent from drugs and alcohol and carving out a better life. She has undertaken counselling, including for drug and alcohol misuse and eating disorders.

20There is no suggestion that the offender is now psychotic. She is prescribed Sertaline for anxiety. 

21The serious aspects of the offence are that the offender deliberately used a knife and that her act was done in the presence of the deceased's brother, who was noticeably shaken by the event.

22By accepting the offender's plea of guilty of manslaughter the Crown accepts that the offender did not intend so much as to inflict serious injury on the deceased. I am satisfied that she acted on the spur of the moment, seizing a knife that happened to be close at hand.

23The plea of guilty came late, but nevertheless saved the cost of a second trial. I shall make a modest allowance for it.

24The offender told Professor Hayes that she was remorseful and Professor Hayes accepted her expression as genuine. More importantly, the offender has told her Supervising Officer the same thing, and her officer accepts that she is genuine in her expression. 

25I find that she is remorseful. I have made some reference to the things the offender has done while in custody, the courses she has taken, and the attitude she has displayed. As a result of these matters those who have the supervision of her consider that, though she has shown periods of disengagement at times, she has accepted and engaged in all directed counselling and programs. They think that her prospects of rehabilitation are good. Professor Hayes also considers her prospects good and I find on all this evidence that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are good.

26The offender has no prior record.

27A Victim Impact Statement was received from Gino Pepi, the father of the deceased. The report shows how distressing the death of the deceased has been for Mr Pepi and how he continues to suffer. In imposing sentence, the Court is not permitted to take these matters into account, but the sympathy of the Court goes out to Mr Pepi and his family and to all those who have been affected by these tragic events. 

28When sentencing juvenile offenders, the Court has to have regard to a number of special matters. First, while the Court must consider the interests of the community in the imposition of a sentence that reflects the gravity of the offence, special regard must be paid to the rehabilitation of young offenders. In this respect deterrence is generally given less weight and, to some extent, has to give way to the need to foster rehabilitation. Secondly, when a young offender is undergoing a course of education, as this offender is, it is desirable that if possible the sentence allow that course to proceed uninterrupted. Thirdly, special attention needs to be given to the needs of dependent or immature offenders for guidance and assistance.

29Having in mind the gravity of the offence and the countervailing subjective features, I have come to the view that an appropriate head sentence will be imprisonment for five years and six months. The facts that the offender is still young, has good prospects of rehabilitation and will have particular need on release to parole of supervised treatment and support to help her overcome the serious setbacks she has encountered justifies fixing a parole period that exceeds one-third of the non-parole period.

30Ever since her arrest, the offender has been kept within a Juvenile Justice institution and has turned herself to the special programs made available for her there. She has responded well and has taken the opportunity to prepare herself for a useful and responsible life on her release, though there is still a long way to go. If the offender were moved to an adult correctional institution these programs would not be available to her and that would be detrimental to her prospects of rehabilitation. In that regard I accept the opinion of the authors of the background report.

31I find that special circumstances exist that make the offender eligible to serve her sentence as a juvenile offender, notwithstanding that she has now attained the age of eighteen years. They are that she is vulnerable on account of illness, in particular from bodily malfunction resulting from Crohn's Disease and in that her fragile psychological state is apt to affect her emotions and judgment. In addition, the educational, vocational training and therapeutic programs she needs are available to her only in a detention centre. In my opinion it is only by the continuation of those programs that her prospects of rehabilitation will be best supported.

32JC, for the manslaughter of BD I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years, which will be taken to have commenced on 7 October 2010 and which will expire on 6 October 2013. The balance of your sentence will be two years and six months, expiring on 6 April 2016. The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 6 October 2013. I direct that you serve your sentence as a juvenile offender.

		20 November 2012",2012-10-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760289,R v James [2012] NSWSC 1268,"Judgment

Introduction

1This judgment constitutes my reasons for a determination that the accused, who is charged with murder, is fit to stand trial. 

Chronology

2This recitation is founded on the evidence tendered before me today, including some matters that were agreed by counsel at the Bar table. 

3On 26 May 2011, the body of the deceased was located at a home in Doonside. The accused was arrested on the same day, and charged with murder on the following day, 27 May 2011. 

4On 26 November 2011, Dr Susan Pulman, a clinical neuropsychologist whose expertise I readily accept, saw the accused in custody at the request of his solicitor. She had been asked to address a number of issues, including the fitness of the accused to stand trial. She provided a report of 15 December 2011. To summarise her report very succinctly, she described the accused as having suffered a very adverse background; having engaged in very longstanding abuse of illicit drugs and alcohol; and possessing a level of intellectual functioning that fell within ""the extremely low range with his result falling at 0.4 of a percentile"", including significant difficulties with attention and concentration, information processing, new learning and recent memory, and reading abilities. 

5With regard to the test in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 (to which I shall return in a moment), Dr Pulman considered that the accused was able to understand the charge; understood the meaning of guilty and not guilty; had a rudimentary understanding of the right to challenge; understood the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings; demonstrated basic understanding of the various roles of persons in court; and understood in very simple terms what evidence is. 

6However, Dr Pulman expressed ""considerable concerns"" about the ability of the accused to follow the course of proceedings, based on his level of intellectual functioning. She also considered that his heightened anxiety was likely to further impede that ability. She did not at that stage express a firm opinion as to whether or not the accused was fit to stand trial. 

7In a brief supplementary report that must be of 5 April 2012, Dr Pulman reported having seen the accused again on 28 February 2012 for the purpose of further psychological assessment. In that report, she expressed the opinion that, on the balance of probabilities, the accused was unfit to stand trial. However, she went on to say ""should his anxiety ameliorate considerably within the next 12 months there remains the possibility that his cognitive function will improve and accordingly he may become fit to stand trial.""

8The issue of the fitness of the accused to stand trial was raised formally in this Court, at the latest, on the arraignment of the accused on 1 June 2012. The issue was raised by counsel for the accused. That occurred after she had engaged in a number of conferences with the accused that gave rise to concern on her part and the part of her instructing solicitor as to whether or not the accused was fit to stand trial.

9On 2 August 2012, Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, provided a report with regard to the fitness of the accused to stand trial at the request of the Crown. He had evaluated the accused in his offices on 29 May 2012. Again, I accept the expertise and experience of Dr Allnutt without reservation. 

10Summarising that report, again with great succinctness, Dr Allnutt accepted the level of intellectual functioning discerned by Dr Pulman. He also recorded that the accused had told him that he would sometimes hear ""the voice of Satan"" both inside and outside his head, but Dr Allnutt was more inclined to regard such phenomena as arising from the underlying personality structure and anxiety disorder of the accused, rather than concluding that they were auditory hallucinations. 

11Dr Allnutt recorded that the accused was suffering from a significant problem with anxiety, for which he had been prescribed medication. 

12In short, Dr Allnutt found that ""his [f]unctioning in my view is significantly impaired secondary to his multiple social and psychological problems.""

13Dr Allnutt considered the requirements of the test in R v Presser, and generally found that the accused fulfilled those requirements. In short, Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that, although the accused had the cognitive ability to engage in the trial process, including providing instructions to his solicitor, it was in truth the underlying anxiety disorder that raised the issue of unfitness to stand trial. 

14Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the fitness issue was ""marginal"" based on the assessment at that time, but that it was likely that with support and exposure to the trial process the accused would, on balance, be fit to stand trial. 

15Finally, Dr Allnutt suggested that any trial court might wish to take frequent breaks during a trial, and also ensure that the accused would have regular support available to him during the trial. 

16On 11 October 2012, Dr Pulman provided a further report to the solicitor for the accused. By that time she has seen the accused again, on 12 September 2012, and had also read the report of Dr Allnutt. 

17In short, Dr Pulman considered that the presentation of the accused had markedly improved since the two occasions when she had seen him some months before. Despite the continuing presence of an anxiety disorder and his continuing cognitive issues, Dr Pulman noted that the engagement of the accused in the interview process was increased, and that his responses demonstrated a capacity to comprehend questions, and to reason appropriately when he wished to do so. 

18Dr Pulman also engaged in further questioning of the accused with regard to the test in R v Presser, up until the point when the accused indicated that he had had enough. 

19Dr Pulman concluded her final report by expressing her opinion that on the balance of probabilities the accused is fit to stand trial. She expressed the opinion that his fitness is ""based on the constant availability of a support person during the trial and the provision of frequent breaks to enable Mr James sufficient time to process court proceedings"".

Aspects of hearing

20It is appropriate for me to recount very briefly the attributes of the hearing that I have conducted. 

21I have conducted this enquiry because it appears to me that the question of the unfitness of the accused to be tried was raised in good faith: s 10(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""). 

22In light of the offence with which the accused has been charged, I am certainly not of the opinion that there is any basis for determining not to conduct an enquiry and dismissing the charge and ordering the release of the accused: see s 10(4) of the Act. 

23In accordance with s 11 of the Act, the question of unfitness to be tried has been determined by me sitting alone without a jury. 

24Pursuant to s 11(2) of the Act, it is incumbent upon me to express my findings of fact, and enunciate the principles of law that I have applied to those facts. In light of the state of the evidence to which I have referred, I shall comply with those requirements, but in a suitably abbreviated form. 

25In accordance with s 12(2), the fitness hearing was not conducted in an adversary manner. Nor, in accordance with s 12(3), did I approach the question on the basis that either party bore an onus of proof with regard to the question of the fitness of the accused. 

Findings of fact

26I am satisfied in light of the expert evidence that the issue of the fitness of the accused has been raised in good faith. I say that whether one is focusing on the position of the accused or the position of his lawyers.

27Furthermore, I accept that each of the experts has accurately and diligently recorded his or her findings, including the details of interviews that they conducted with the accused. I also accept their undoubted expertise with regard to the question, and that they have asked themselves the correct question in expressing their opinions. Finally, I accept the correctness of their unanimous opinion.

Applicable legal principles

28The leading case in NSW has for many years been R v Presser. In a well-known passage, Smith J of the Supreme Court of Victoria said ""And the question, I consider, is whether the accused, because of mental defect, fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him.""

29In the next paragraph, his Honour set out the precise requirements of the test: 

""He needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.""

30Although the question of fitness to stand trial has been considered by the High Court of Australia and the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State on a number of occasions since then, the principles enunciated in R v Presser continue to be applicable. So much was explicitly agreed by both counsel before me today. It is appropriate for me to refer briefly to two of those decisions.

31In Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230 the plurality of the High Court emphasised that consideration of the estimated length of the trial is an important part of a fitness hearing. Emphasis was also placed upon the need for an accused to be fit at this time to stand trial throughout the whole of the trial, including at its conclusion. 

32In R v Mailes [2001] NSWCCA 155; (2001) 53 NSWLR 251, the Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised that unfitness is not restricted to being founded only upon a mental illness or disorder, but includes intellectual disability and other matters. Emphasis was also placed on the ""brake"" provided by the requirement of ""good faith"" in s 10(2), Spigelman CJ focussing on the good faith of the accused. Wood CJ at CL stated at [227]:

""while its content is undefined, I would find it difficult for a court to make a finding that a question had been raised other than in good faith, where the material available suggested that there was a real and substantial, or a genuine concern as to an accused's fitness to stand trial, and where counsel, who it may be assumed had much greater contact with the accused than anyone else, had drawn that matter to attention.""


Decision

33As I have said, I am satisfied that the issue of the fitness of the accused has been raised in good faith.

34In light of the fact that two experts of great experience have carefully considered the test to be applied, and are unanimous in their opinion that the accused complies with that test, I accept that the accused does pass the test enunciated in R v Presser. There does not seem to me to be any basis upon which I should reject those opinions. In particular, there is no evidence from the solicitor for the accused, from either in the witness box or in the form of an affidavit, to the effect that he is unable to receive proper instructions from the accused, or that there is any other impediment to the accused engaging properly in the trial, or indeed to the effect that the solicitor has any lingering concerns about that process. 

35Nor is there any other evidence that has been placed before me that would lead me to reject the opinion of the psychologist and the psychiatrist. 

36Applying the test in R v Presser to all of the evidence placed before me in the fitness hearing, including of course the matters that I have received from the Bar table by agreement, I find that the accused is fit to stand trial. That would include a long trial, featuring a variety of detailed evidence, as one might expect on a count of murder. 

37That decision is predicated on the provision of frequent breaks and a support person to the accused, as necessary, and as discussed in the reports of the two experts. 

38In light of my finding, according to s 13 of the Act, the proceedings against the accused are to continue ""in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures"". With the agreement of the parties, I propose to make an order to give effect to that statutory requirement. In light of the fact that I understand that there is an application for variation of bail conditions, I shall deal with that question separately. 

39In short, my formal decision at the end of the enquiry into the fitness of the accused to stand trial is that I find that he is fit to stand trial. 

Order

40The accused having been found fit to stand trial, I order that the proceedings be adjourned to the Arraignments List in the Supreme Court at 10am on Friday 2 November 2012.

2760298,Dowse v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 337,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In the early hours of 11 March 2007 the appellant encountered two police officers near Callan Park in the inner-west of Sydney. During a verbal altercation, he said to the officers ""Come on, do you want to chase me? Fucking chase me through Callan Park"". The officers began to leave the area in their car, but decided to approach the appellant in their car. The appellant began to run from the officers' car, and entered the grounds of Callan Park. The officers saw him again when he was near the entrance to Rozelle Hospital, where they alighted from the car and gave chase on foot. The appellant fell in the grounds of the Hospital, landing on his right elbow, which fractured.

In 2010 the appellant commenced proceedings against the State of New South Wales in the District Court. The action was brought in negligence and trespass to the person. One issue was whether the officers had the necessary suspicion to engage the power to arrest the appellant. The State contended that they had pursued the appellant because they suspected that he had used offensive language in a public place or had entered inclosed land without permission. The trial judge gave judgment for the State.

The appellant appealed to this Court. The State filed a notice of contention suggesting that the power to arrest or detain could also be supported by a reasonable suspicion that the appellant had committed the offence of hinder police, or had drugs or drug paraphernalia on his person.

The issues for determination on appeal were:

(i) whether the power to arrest or detain was supported by a relevant reasonable suspicion, and 
(ii) whether there was a tortious cause of the accident.

The Court held (per Basten JA, McColl and Hoeben JJA agreeing), dismissing the appeal:

In relation to (i)

1. An arrest will not be valid merely because the officer reasonably believes that an offence has been committed, in circumstances where the officer has no intention of charging the person or having the person charged with that offence: [26]-[28]

O'Hara v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [1997] AC 286 applied; State of New South Wales v Delly [2007] NSWCA 303; 70 NSWLR 125; Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 referred to.

2. Any suspicion held by the officers that the appellant had committed the offence of using offensive language in or near a public place could not justify their conduct. That was because the officers' acts and evidence demonstrated that they did not intend to arrest the appellant because he had used offensive language: [24]-[25], [29]

3. Neither officer gave evidence that they sought to arrest the appellant because of a suspicion that the appellant had committed the offence of hindering police in the execution of their duties: [30]

4. The officers' failure to attempt to search the appellant suggested that they did not intend to exercise a power to detain him in relation to possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia. Neither gave evidence that they questioned him about any possible use of drugs, let alone present possession of drugs. The trial judge correctly held that neither had reasonable cause to suspect that he had drugs in his possession: [34]-[35]

5. The commencement of the chase, which occurred when the appellant was on a public street, could not have been justified by a suspicion in respect of an offence under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW): [39]

In relation to (ii)

6. The claim in trespass was properly rejected. Prior to the appellant running onto the grounds of Rozelle Hospital, the officers were not seeking to exercise coercive powers, nor did the appellant think that they were. The appellant's choice to run was not the result of tortious conduct on the part of the officers: [47], [55]

7. The claim in negligence was properly rejected. Given that it was the appellant's choice to run and that he took a route through Rozelle Hospital, the officers did not owe him a duty of care. Once he entered Hospital grounds, the officers had reasonable grounds to suspect he had committed an offence. From that point the chase constituted a reasonable exercise of the power to arrest him: [49], [51]

8. The tort of trespass, available where police officers use excessive force, is sufficient to ensure that officers do not abuse their power of arrest. There is no purpose to be gained by superimposing a duty of care with respect to the exercise of such a power. The imposition of such a duty may create disconformity with the statutory scheme governing the relationship between a police officer and persons who are suspected of having committed offences or are otherwise proper subjects of police investigations: [52]

Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; 207 CLR 562; State of Victoria v Richards [2010] VSCA 113; 27 VR 343 referred to.



			Judgment

1McCOLL JA: I agree with Basten JA.

2BASTEN JA: In the early hours of 11 March 2007 the appellant, Garry Dowse, fell whilst being chased by two police officers through the grounds of Rozelle Hospital in Callan Park in the inner-west of Sydney. He fell, landing on his right elbow, which fractured. Three years later he commenced proceedings against the State of New South Wales alleging liability for tortious conduct of two police officers who chased him, formulated alternatively in negligence and trespass to the person. The State accepted liability, if tortious conduct were established on the part of the officers, pursuant to the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW).

3When the officers and the appellant first encountered one another, the appellant was walking home after a night at his local pub and the officers were questioning two young persons on the footpath on Balmain Road, Rozelle, near the corner with The Boulevarde. The appellant expressed doubts as to the utility of the activity in which the officers were then engaged. They initially treated the appellant as a distraction, but after completing their business with the two young persons, they followed the appellant into Callan Park with the intention of questioning him. When the appellant took to his heels, the officers chased him, being an activity which he had originally proposed. The trial judge in the District Court, Armitage DCJ, gave judgment for the defendant and dismissed the proceedings. 

Issues on appeal
4Although the trial judge gave detailed consideration to the evidence of each individual witness, the critical findings fell within a short compass. They were as follows:

(a) if the officers had the necessary suspicion engaging the power to arrest the appellant, their conduct was lawful;
(b) if that power was engaged, they did not use excessive force in exercising the power;
(c) again, if the power were engaged, the act of chasing the appellant, whilst involving an element of danger both to the appellant and to themselves, did not constitute negligence;
(d) the power was engaged because the officers reasonably suspected the appellant -

(i) had used offensive language in a public place, and
(ii) had entered inclosed land without permission.

5The appellant challenged each of the findings justifying the engagement of the power to arrest. In the absence of such a power he contended that the conduct of the officers involved both a trespass and a breach of duty of care owed to him as a member of the public.

6The respondent filed a notice of contention seeking to uphold the judgment below on two additional bases for the exercise of the powers of arrest, or to stop, search and detain, namely a reasonable suspicion that the appellant -

(i) had committed the offence of hinder police, and
(ii) had drugs or drug paraphernalia on his person.

7Against the possibility that he was in error in dismissing the claim on the basis that no tortious conduct had been established, the trial judge assessed damages under the general law in an amount of $110,187. That figure was accepted by the parties as appropriate if an entitlement to damages for trespass to the person were established. In the event that the State were to be found liable in negligence, an assessment would have been required under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), which was not undertaken.

8For the reasons which follow, both causes of action were properly dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal must fail.

Powers of arrest: legal principles
9Two different statutory powers were invoked by the respondent in its defence of the conduct of the officers. The first was the power to stop, search and detain, found in s 21(1) of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) (""the Law Enforcement Act""), which provides:

""21 Power to search persons and seize and detain things without warrant

(1) A police officer may, without a warrant, stop, search and detain a person, and anything in the possession of or under the control of the person, if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that any of the following circumstances exists:

(a) the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained,
(b) the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control anything used or intended to be used in or in connection with the commission of a relevant offence,
(c) the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control in a public place a dangerous article that is being or was used in or in connection with the commission of a relevant offence,
(d) the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control, in contravention of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, a prohibited plant or a prohibited drug.""

10In the alternative, the State called in aid the power of arrest pursuant to s 99 of the Law Enforcement Act, which provides:

""99 Power of police officers to arrest without warrant

(1) A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if:

(a) the person is in the act of committing an offence under any Act or statutory instrument, or
(b) the person has just committed any such offence, or
(c) the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried.

(2) A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has committed an offence under any Act or statutory instrument.

(3) A police officer must not arrest a person for the purpose of taking proceedings for an offence against the person unless the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to arrest the person to achieve one or more of the following purposes:

(a) to ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence,
(b) to prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence,
(c) to prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence,
(d) to prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence,
(e) to prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence,
(f) to preserve the safety or welfare of the person.

(4) A police officer who arrests a person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law.""

11The Law Enforcement Act deals separately with the use of force by police officers:

""230 Use of force generally by police officers

It is lawful for a police officer exercising a function under this Act or any other Act or law in relation to an individual or a thing, and anyone helping the police officer, to use such force as is reasonably necessary to exercise the function.

231 Use of force in making an arrest

A police officer or other person who exercises a power to arrest another person may use such force as is reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest.""

12It is convenient to focus first on the power of arrest, as that was the power accepted by the trial judge as the basis on which the conduct of the officers was to be justified: Judgment at pp 28 and 32. So far as offensive language and, potentially, the offences of hinder police and enter inclosed lands were concerned, the relevant power was that found in s 99(2) permitting an officer to arrest if he or she suspected on reasonable grounds that the person had committed an offence. That condition involves an actual and honestly held suspicion on the part of the officer for which, in addition, there must be reasonable grounds. As explained by Lord Hope of Craighead in O'Hara v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [1997] AC 286 at 298, referring to similar language in the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (UK), s 12, as to the applicable test:

""It relates entirely to what is in the mind of the arresting officer when the power is exercised. In part it is a subjective test, because he must have formed a genuine suspicion in his own mind that the person has been concerned in acts of terrorism. In part also it is an objective one, because there must also be reasonable grounds for the suspicion which he has formed. But the application of the objective test does not require the court to look beyond what was in the mind of the arresting officer. It is the grounds which were in his mind at the time which must be found to be reasonable grounds for the suspicion which he has formed. All that the objective test requires is that these grounds be examined objectively and that they be judged at the time when the power was exercised.""

Background to accident
13In order to apply these principles in the circumstances of the case, it is convenient to address the actual suspicions held by the officers and the grounds for those suspicions by reference to the events of the evening, briefly stated. Both constables gave evidence that at about 3am on the morning of 11 March 2007 they were speaking to two young persons on Balmain Road at Rozelle, near the intersection with The Boulevarde, when Mr Dowse walked past with a friend. Constable Fraser gave evidence that the appellant said something like ""Are you alright, brother?"": Tcpt, p 264(45). Constable Fraser formed the impression that he was probably intoxicated. The appellant and his friend then crossed The Boulevarde, sat on a brick wall and continued calling out words to the effect ""Let him go"": Tcpt, p 265(27) and (40). 

14When they had finished speaking to the young persons and directed them to move along, the officers walked along Balmain Road towards the appellant and his friend, at which point the appellant got up, ran across Balmain Road in a northerly direction towards Callan Park saying ""Come on, do you want to chase me? Fucking chase me through Callan Park"": Tcpt, p 266(35). Constable Fraser was asked whether he formed the opinion that the appellant had committed an offence and responded (p 267(5)-(25)):

""Yeah. Yes, he was - due to the time, it was night, and his behaviour is, essentially, saying breach the peace by the noise that he was making, and then he's also - he's hindering our - our investigation with - the young person by distracting us. 
...

Well, once he started swearing, then he - he's - he's, you know, his language is becoming offensive, so yes.

Q. What did he say to you when he crossed the road?
A. He continued saying stuff like, 'Come on, chase me. Fucking chase me. Come on.'

Q. And did he say that in a loud voice?
A. Yes.

Q. Was it in an aggressive manner?
A. Yeah, it was - yeah. He was being, you know, he was trying to get a response. Get - trying to get some sort of reaction.
...

Q. Had you said anything to Mr Dowse at that stage?
A. I probably - I believe I told him something like, 'Mate, just shut up and go home'.""

15The evidence of Constable Edwards was a little more detailed, but to similar effect: pp 201(30)-(45) and 205(35)-(45). Referring to the time when the appellant ran across Balmain Road in a northerly direction, Constable Edwards was asked (Tcpt, p 206(5):

""Q. At that stage had Mr Dowse committed any offence?
A. Well hindering [offensive] language and he was just running across the road.

Q. Well running across the road is not an offence?
A. No.""

16Both officers then gave evidence that they had said ""I'm not chasing you, you idiot"" or words to that effect and had returned to their car. The car was facing west on Balmain Road and Constable Edwards did a U-turn and started to go in an easterly direction back towards Balmain Police Station where the officers were then working: Tcpt, p 206(40). The evidence of Constable Edwards continued:

""Q. Why were you going back to Balmain Police Station?
A. It was the - the end of our shift. So we were - we were commencing to head back to work - back to the station and doing events and - 

Q. Did you go back to the Police Station?
A. As we were driving back Constable Fraser and I had a conversation. You know, 'Should we have a look at him? Should we have a chat to him?' We were driving back. We said yes, we should go and have a chat to him as he was running off into Callan Park so I was driving along and we got to the intersection - 

Q. Just let me stop you there. We'll come back to that in a minute. Why did you decide or consider it necessary to go back and have a look at him?
A. Well, I was under the opinion that he was - well, he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of the two.

Q. Why did you form that opinion?
A. Just his behaviour at the time that we were speaking to the two - two young people. It's not normal behaviour to yell out and scream and swear at police just as they're well, talking to two people.""

17Constable Edwards gave evidence that he then turned into Callan Park grounds. When they saw the appellant near the entrance to Rozelle Hospital, Constable Fraser got out of the vehicle and chased after the appellant who ran into the Hospital grounds. Constable Edwards followed. After describing the chase and apprehension, Constable Edwards gave the following evidence at Tcpt, pp 226(45)-227(35):

""Q. When you first observed Mr Dowse within the - I withdraw that - when you first - I withdraw that - when you next saw Mr Dowse when he was adjacent to the sign, the Rozelle Hospital sign, why did you decide to pursue him?
A. Well he was trespassing on the - on the hospital grounds.

Q. Was there any other reason?
A. From speaking to him when we were up on Balmain Road I - I assumed that Mr Dowse was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or a combination of both. I also assumed that he'd still have some drugs on him, he'd have some, you know, drugs or drug paraphernalia on him.

Q. Does that have any significance, that he had some drug paraphernalia on him?
A. Well, yes. Yeah, under the stop, search, and detain powers that if we believe that someone's in possession of drugs or - or something that's been used in the commission of an offence, yeah, we have the power to stop, search, and detain so - and - and generally if someone runs from you and acts in that way it - it's an indication that, yeah, they've got something on them.

Q. What was it that made you form the opinion that he may have some drugs on him?
A. Well I believed he was under the influence of alcohol or another drug and - and he ran from us and ran into the grounds to obviously get away from us.

Q. Did you charge him with any offence?
A. No, we didn't charge him with any offence.

Q. Why didn't you charge him with any offences?
A. We - we used our discretion. We understand he was - he was on his way home. He was running home. He - yeah, he - he - well, he abused us for and yelled at us for whatever reason. We gave him a verbal warning in relation to trespassing.

Q. Well when you say a verbal warning what do you mean?
A. We informed him that he's - that he was trespassing and he shouldn't be, you know, you shouldn't be running home through Rozelle Hospital at - at 4am in the morning, you know.""

18On 19 April 2007 Constable Edwards prepared a report on the incident in response to a request from an Inspector of Police following an allegation from the appellant that he had been beaten with a police-style baton. That report was admitted as Exhibit 13. In substance it was consistent with the evidence the officers gave but described the appellant as ""walking into [the] driveway of the car park of the facility"", which he described as Aldersgate Retirement Village and Nursing Home. It was agreed at the trial that this was intended to be a reference to Rozelle Hospital. The report continued:

""Current intelligent reports suggest that this location is being used for intravenous drug use with syringes and associated paraphernalia being discarded there.""

19Constable Fraser was cross-examined briefly as to why he had chased the appellant after he saw him walking along Wharf Road, which was a public road in the grounds of Callan Park (Tcpt, pp 288(25)-289(40)):

""Q. Why didn't you just let him go?
A. Well as I explained earlier, I had several concerns stemming from his behaviour earlier on on Balmain Road, and I was also concerned that he was entering the grounds of Rozelle Hospital - which was a psychiatric hospital at the time. So I had some concerns for his own welfare and any other persons that may have been in the - in the grounds at the time.

Q. But when you saw him he was just walking down Wharf Road, wasn't he?
A. After we had entered Rozelle Hospital.

Q. But when you saw him he was just walking down Wharf Road, wasn't he?
A. Well when I saw him he started running.

Q. I thought it was when you called out 'Stop' that he started running?
...
HIS HONOUR:
...

Q. - but when you saw him walking down Wharf Road, he was walking down - at least according to the map I have in front of me here - a public street, is that right?
A. That's correct.

Q. He wasn't running in a way that suggested that he was trying to evade anybody at that point, was he?
A. Not at that point.

Q. Well why exactly did you want to stop him in those circumstances?
A. We wanted to speak with him and ascertain why he was - why he had entered the grounds of the - of - or the grounds of the park and the Ambulance training centre and also to - we had - I had some concerns due to his behaviour that - as I said earlier - he could have been affected by drugs and we just wanted to speak with him and - you know, make some enquiries as to what he was doing.

Q. When somebody yells out to you, 'Chase me, chase me', doesn't that make it unlikely that they're carrying drugs or some other illegal substance?
A. It - it - I - I wouldn't know. It may.

BERWICK [Counsel for the appellant]:
...

Q. Once again, why didn't you just let him go?
A. Well my suspicion was certainly aroused and heightened when he began sprinting as soon as he saw our car. So my concerns that I held before were most definitely increased to a point where I was - I wanted to ascertain who he was and why he was - why he was in such a hurry to get away.

Q. Well the answer was pretty obvious, wasn't it? You'd had an encounter with him up on Balmain Road?
A. I wouldn't say it was obvious.

Q. Well it's the most likely conclusion to draw in the circumstances, isn't it?
A. Well he - he hadn't sprinted from us on Balmain Road.""

20In setting out the evidence given by Constable Edwards, the primary judge referred to the belief that the appellant had trespassed on the grounds of Rozelle Hospital and continued (Judgment, p 15):

""It indicates to me that he having so recorded, at a time reasonably proximate to the events in question, and before litigation was contemplated, Constable Edwards was genuinely of the belief, at the time of the chase when the plaintiff fell and suffered the injuries in question, that the plaintiff was trespassing, although I should carefully note that the report does not refer to any belief on the part of Constable Edwards that the plaintiff had committed the offences of using offence language or hindering police in the execution of their duty.""

21Further in recounting the evidence, his Honour continued (p 17):

""Constable Edwards gave evidence that he decided to pursue the [appellant] because he was trespassing on the hospital grounds, and that he also assumed that the [appellant] was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or a combination of both, and also assumed that he would have some drugs on him, and that he may have drugs or drug paraphernalia in his possession.""

22The primary judge rejected that suspicion as not reasonably based but also concluded that Constable Edwards ""was genuinely of the view that the plaintiff had committed the offences of hindering police and using offensive language at that time"": p 17.

No arrest for offensive language
23It is an offence to use offensive language in or near a public place: Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW), s 4A(1). Counsel for the appellant submitted, somewhat flamboyantly, that the language used by the appellant on Balmain Road could not constitute offensive language. It was an issue, he submitted, which raised a point of public importance.

24That submission should be rejected for two reasons. First, as emphatically stated by Bray CJ in Dalton v Bartlett (1972) 3 SASR 549 at 555, in relation to the related offence of indecent language and in respect of similar words, ""whether or not words like these when used in a public place on any particular occasion are indecent is, in one sense, a question of fact to be decided by the application of an evaluatory standard after due consideration of the circumstances and the context"". There are many circumstances in which such language will not contravene s 4A, but that is not to say that there are none in which it can. Secondly, the question for present purposes was not whether it could or did constitute an offence, but whether such language could, in the circumstances and manner in which it was used, provide reasonable grounds for a suspicion that the appellant had committed an offence.

25There are, however, further reasons why those questions need not be further considered. Thus it was tolerably clear that the officers did not carry out, or even attempt to carry out, an arrest based on such an offence. First, they drove away from the scene of the ""offence"" intending to return to the station. Secondly, when they decided to have a chat to the appellant, it was not because of anything to do with offensive language. Thirdly, when they apprehended him, he was not arrested for that reason. Fourthly, the decision not to arrest (if it had ever been intended) was not taken because of some discussion about offensive language, but for different reasons.

26While it is true, as Lord Hope explained in O'Hara, that there are two elements to be satisfied for a warrantless arrest to be valid, namely an honestly held suspicion in the mind of the arresting officer and information in the mind of the arresting officer which when objectively assessed provides reasonable grounds for the suspicion, these are not abstract and independent elements. They justify a deprivation of liberty which in turn is part of an ongoing process by which the person arrested must be taken before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law: Law Enforcement Act, s 99(4). In other words, the arrest is a first step in the process by which the person is to be made answerable for the offence, the commission of which the officer suspects. The same underlying purpose is to be found in s 99(3) which limits the circumstances in which an officer may arrest a person ""for the purpose of taking proceedings for an offence against the person""; it thus assumes that such a purpose must underlie a valid arrest. 

27In other words, an arrest will not be valid merely because the officer believes that an offence has been committed, in circumstances where the officer has no intention of charging the person or having the person charged with that offence. If that were not so, the legal requirement that the person arrested be informed of the true grounds of the arrest would be rendered nugatory: see State of New South Wales v Delly [2007] NSWCA 303; 70 NSWLR 125 at [9]-[11] (Ipp JA), adopting the reasoning of Lord Simonds in Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 at 591-592. As Tobias JA stated at [71], after referring to the provision in force in 1998 empowering an officer to arrest without warrant on the basis of a suspicion with reasonable cause:

""It logically follows that where an arrest which complied with that requirement was effected, the arresting officer was obliged by the common law to inform the arrestee of the nature of the offence which he, the arresting officer, suspects the arrestee to have committed. To arrest a person on the suspicion of that person having committed offence A but to inform that person that the reason for the arrest is offence B, would be a nonsense and contrary to the clear policy which underpins what has been described by Lord Simonds in Christie as a fundamental rule of the common law with respect to the lawful deprivation of a person of his or her liberty.""

28In a passage referred to with approval by Tobias JA, I said that ""[t]he information to be supplied by the arresting officer is his or her reason for carrying out the arrest"": at [102].

29Neither Constable Edwards nor Constable Fraser gave evidence either that when they drove into Callan Park they intended to arrest the appellant, or that they sought to do so because he had used offensive language. Accordingly, the fact that he may have used offensive language could not, in the circumstances of this case, constitute justification for the allegedly tortious conduct.

No arrest for hinder police
30The same reasoning applies to the offence of hindering police in the execution of their duties, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 546C. While it is not in doubt that such conduct constitutes an offence and that the officers may have suspected the appellant of committing such an offence, neither gave that as a reason for seeking to arrest the appellant (on the assumption that they did intend to arrest the appellant, prior to him entering the grounds of the Hospital). Accordingly it is neither necessary nor appropriate to determine whether the trial judge was correct in concluding that there were no reasonable grounds for the officers' suspicions in that regard.

31It is also unnecessary in those circumstances to consider whether the power to arrest was in any event not satisfied because neither officer gave evidence of holding a suspicion that it was necessary to arrest the appellant to achieve one of the purposes specified in s 99(3).

32The only tenable understanding of the officers' intentions, as revealed in their evidence and by their actual conduct, was that they did not in fact intend to arrest the appellant before he entered the Hospital grounds, but rather sought to exercise their powers under s 21 of the Law Enforcement Act.

Suspicion of drug use and possession
33For the reasons already given, it is doubtful that the police officers had any intention of arresting the appellant when they turned to drive into the grounds of Callan Park. Rather, they proposed to ""go and have a chat to him"" as explained by both: Tcpt, p 206(49) (Constable Edwards); Tcpt, p 268(10) (Constable Fraser). In the course of the hearing, reliance was placed upon the power to stop, search and detain a person under s 21 of the Law Enforcement Act: see [9] above. However, that power was limited, relevantly, to circumstances where the officers suspected on reasonable grounds that the person had in his or her possession or control a prohibited plant or drug. 

34The trial judge was not satisfied that Constable Edwards' suspicion ""that the plaintiff was affected by drugs or might have drugs or drug paraphernalia on him was a reasonable one, having regard to the plaintiff's behaviour, as I think this was adequately explained by his obvious intoxication, which he himself admitted as a result of ingestion of alcohol at the Garry Owen Hotel, although to be fair the police officers did not know where the plaintiff had ingested alcohol, as opposed to forming the view that he was drunk"": Judgment, p 17. He therefore concluded that neither constable had reasonable cause to suspect that the appellant had drugs in his possession and held that s 21(1)(d) did not justify the attempted apprehension of the plaintiff following the chase: Judgment, p 21.

35Again, one may doubt that the officers had any actual intention to exercise such a power at the time they initiated the chase, not only because of the circumstances explained by the trial judge, but because, when they eventually apprehended the appellant, they made no attempt to search him, beyond asking him to empty his pockets, before issuing a warning for trespassing. Nor did they give evidence that they questioned him about any possible use of drugs, let alone present possession of drugs.

36Although the respondent sought by way of contention to challenge his Honour's finding in that regard, that challenge should be rejected.

Trespass on inclosed lands
37The final basis upon which the respondent sought to justify the exercise of force by the officers was that the appellant had, without lawful excuse, entered onto inclosed lands without the consent of the occupier, in contravention of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW), s 4(1).

38The trial judge dealt with this issue at pp 29-32. In particular, he considered whether the evidence that members of the public regularly walked through the Hospital grounds constituted an implied permission and thus a lawful excuse for the appellant's presence at 3am in the morning. He held that it did not. His Honour expressed his conclusion in the following terms at pp 31-32:

""In those circumstances I accept the defendant's submission that Constable Fraser, and in particular Constable Edwards, were entitled to form the suspicion on reasonable grounds immediately prior to the plaintiff's apprehension and immediately prior to the fall which he suffered on the premises of Rozelle Hospital, that he had also committed an offence under s 4(1) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act, and it follows that their actions after they saw the plaintiff for a second time inside the premises of Rozelle Hospital, and when they pursued him, and when he fell down the stairs on the premises of Rozelle Hospital, and when he was apprehended on the grass in the premises of Rozelle Hospital after the use of a 'legsweep' by Constable Fraser, were lawful under s 99 of [the Law Enforcement Act]....""

39This analysis requires further consideration of the circumstances in which the chase began. The trial judge found (to which finding there is no challenge) that the appellant fell and injured himself while running away from police and injured his elbow at that point. That finding negated the allegations that the appellant had been pushed or struck or otherwise physically touched by either officer prior to his fall and injury. That he was thereafter detained before being released was not in doubt; however, the injury relied upon as the source of damage occurred prior to his apprehension. That occurred as a result of the chase. However, the chase commenced when he was on a public street and, as the finding set out above recognises, the commencement of the chase could not have been justified by a suspicion in respect of an offence under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act.

Was there a tortious cause of the injury?
40In a practical sense, the conduct of the police officers which might be said to have a direct causal connection with the injury was the driving of the police vehicle towards the appellant who was then on Wharf Road and the call to him to stop. At that point the appellant chose to run. However, even if the police had no basis for exercising powers under either s 21 or s 99 of the Law Enforcement Act at that point, it did not follow that the conduct described was tortious. As the officers did not touch the appellant before he suffered his injury, the potentially relevant torts were assault and negligence, but not battery. 

(a) assault
41Considering first the tort of assault, there are two relevant elements. The first is that the defendant's conduct must be such as to cause the plaintiff to apprehend unlawful physical contact. The second is that the plaintiff must be put in apprehension of such unlawful contact: R v Phillips (1971) 45 ALJR 467 at 472.

42The appellant gave evidence that after the altercation in Balmain Road he entered the area within Callan Park used by the NSW Ambulance Service and started to make his way home which involved going in a north-westerly direction through the streets between the buildings in Callan Park. In answer to an early question as to what happened after he left Balmain Road, he answered, in respect of a point in time and place which was then unclear (Tcpt, p 41(35)):

""As I was walking there wasn't much traffic, I noticed a car travelling from behind me with a roar of thunder and I realised that it was police and as the car roared down the street I realised it was the police and decided I didn't want to answer their questions, so I took off.""

43He gave evidence of going along a roadway past a nursing home to Wharf Road, at which point the following evidence was given (p 50):

""He got out of the car saying, 'Stop you effing little prick.'

Q. So it's a court of law you don't have to be embarrassed, so what did he say to you?
A. 'Stop you effing little prick.'

Q. So ... your evidence is that he said, 'Stop you fucking little prick,' correct?
A. Yes.
...

Q. And how would you describe the way he said?
A. With anger.

Q. And what did that cause you to do?
A. I was scared.

Q. And because you were scared what did you do?
A. Kept running.

Q. Now you kept running and where did you run to, what did you run into?
A. A continuation of Callan Park.""

44He gave evidence that as he went through the grounds of Rozelle Hospital towards Glover Street he was aware that at least one of the police officers had got out of the car and was chasing him: pp 55-56.

45In cross-examination, counsel for the respondent elicited the following evidence (Tcpt, pp 119-122):

""Q. You say you heard a car do you and then you start running?
A. Yes.
...

Q. Why did you run from the police?
A. I thought the matter was over and done with. They wanted to continue it, I didn't.

Q. Didn't you tell his Honour yesterday that you took off because you didn't want to answer any questions from the police?
A. I thought the matter was over and done with.
...

Q. Didn't you tell his Honour yesterday that you ran when you realised it was the police because you didn't want to answer any questions?
A. I did say that but I thought the matter was over and done with.

Q. What questions did you think the police were going to ask you?
A. I don't know like that didn't run through my head.
...

Q. I'll just take you back to my question. Why did you form the view firstly that they were going to ask you questions?
A. That's what the police do, ask you questions.

Q. You believed didn't you that the police were going to ask you questions because of your conduct is that it?
A. Whatever questions they were going to ask I didn't wish to answer.
...

Q. Why did you run?
A. Police told me to move on I thought he was finished with me. I was finished with them.

Q. So they casually said to you move on, correct?
A. Correct.

Q. Then all of a sudden you say you were running from them because you didn't want to answer their questions?
A. I was scared. I didn't want to - like the roar of the car, I was frightened. It made me run.
...

Q. You were afraid of the car, were you?
A. The way they approached in their car. Like I was standing on Balmain Road. I didn't realise it was Bathurst.""

46There was a degree of symmetry between the evidence of the police and the appellant. The police did not state that they wished to arrest the appellant, nor did the appellant think he was to be arrested. The police said they wished to have a ""chat"" with the appellant; the appellant thought they were going to ask him questions. When they eventually apprehended him, they did ask him a number of questions and then let him go with a warning about trespassing.

47Despite the evidence as to the roar of the vehicle, and the appellant's evidence that he was ""scared"", there was no suggestion that he was scared of physical violence, nor that the driving of the motor vehicle was intended to constitute threatening behaviour. Accordingly, prior to the appellant running onto the grounds of Rozelle Hospital, the police were not seeking to exercise coercive powers, nor did the appellant think that they were. The actions of the police no doubt caused the appellant to run, but the actions themselves were not unlawful and did not constitute an assault. The appellant could have stayed and made it clear that he did not wish to answer questions or he could have decamped: he chose the latter course. His choice was not the result of tortious conduct on the part of the police officers. Accordingly, on any view the claim in trespass was properly rejected.

(b) negligence
48Even if the police had sworn at the appellant in the manner he described, he did not suggest that he was in any way put out, let alone that he feared for his physical safety, as a result of that manner of address. 

49Once it is accepted that it was the appellant's choice to run and that he took a route through Rozelle Hospital, it is not entirely clear in what respect the officers owed him a duty of care, nor as to the nature of the duty.

50It may be that the route chosen was in part inspired by an attempt to keep off roadways where the police might have overtaken him in a vehicle, but when asked in his examination in chief as to his knowledge of the route, he said that he had been familiar with it since age 15 (he then being almost 42 years of age). While there were, no doubt, risks associated with running through the Hospital grounds at night, the area was one with which he was well familiar, presumably as a path between the Rozelle shops and his home.

51Whether the appellant would have slipped and fallen had the police not chased him into the Hospital grounds is unclear and there was no finding of fact in that regard. However, once he entered the Hospital grounds, the officers had reasonable grounds to suspect he had committed an offence, namely by entering inclosed lands without lawful excuse. Subject to other potentially relevant considerations, such as the terms of s 99(3), which were not raised in the present proceedings, they were entitled to arrest him and use reasonable force in that regard. For that purpose, the chase constituted a reasonable exercise of the power, given the appellant's decision to flee, as the trial judge found.

52If the officers had used excessive force, causing injury to the appellant, their conduct would not have been justifiable under s 99 of the Law Enforcement Act, nor under the common law and they would, in such a case, have been liable in trespass. That would constitute a sufficient basis for ensuring that the officers did not abuse their power of arrest. There is no purpose to be gained by superimposing a duty of care with respect to the exercise of such a power. The imposition of such a duty may create disconformity with the statutory scheme governing the relationship between a police officer and persons who are suspected of having committed offences or are otherwise proper subjects of police investigations: Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; 207 CLR 562 at [50] and [57] (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ); cf State of Victoria v Richards [2010] VSCA 113; 27 VR 343 (Redlich JA, Nettle JA and Hansen AJA agreeing).

53The trial judge dealt with the question of negligence in the following passage at pp 28-29:

""It is certainly the case that Constable Fraser honestly admitted ... that in chasing the plaintiff into the dark, he was committing an act which was dangerous to both the plaintiff and himself. It was certainly foreseeable the plaintiff might suffer injury as a result of what Constable Edwards, and for that matter Constable Fraser, did. Was that negligent? It was if it was done without power. It was not in my opinion if, as was the case, it was done within the power in s 99. 

It is also my view that as the defendant submits, and as I have already indicated, that Constables Fraser and Edwards used only such force as was reasonably necessary to [effect] the plaintiff's apprehension within s 238 of [the Law Enforcement Act]. In view of that finding, it does not seem to me appropriate to find negligence on the part of either Fraser or Edwards, in the form of any failure to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff.""

54The second paragraph of that passage reflects the foregoing reasoning in this judgment. That is, to the extent that the officers were exercising a function under the Law Enforcement Act and were using no more force than was reasonably necessary for that purpose, it would give rise to incoherence in the law to impose a separate duty of care owed to the appellant which could be breached, despite the findings in respect of the lawful exercise of a statutory function.

55With respect to the first paragraph in the passage set out above, the preferable analysis is that, in the circumstances in which the injury came about, the initiation of the appellant's flight was a choice he made in the absence of any unlawful threat and, to the extent that the injury resulted from the chase by the police officers after he had entered upon inclosed lands, it resulted from the use of reasonable force pursuant to a power to arrest on reasonable suspicion of the offence of entering inclosed lands without lawful excuse. So understood, there was no error in the conclusion reached by the trial judge. 

Conclusion
56For these reasons the appeal should be dismissed; the appellant must pay the respondent's costs in this Court.

57HOEBEN JA: I agree with Basten JA and the orders which he proposes.

		19 October 2012",2012-10-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2760305,R v Francis [2012] NSWDC 306,"Judgment

1Jason Francis has a long criminal record.  He has offended again.  In the sentence he received, the non-parole period was over 80% of the overall sentence.  He argues that the non-parole period should be reduced.  
2He is before me because he was in the Local Court at Bourke on 3 September 2012.  He had been charged with assaulting Tracey Kelly and intimidating her and also contravening a domestic violence order.  These were three separate offences.  Not only that, late last year he had received two suspended sentences for assaulting and intimidating the same person.  
3The more recent offences were in May this year.  The earlier offences were in August last year.  So when he came before the magistrate, his Honour was not only sentencing him for later offences but had to deal with the breach of the bond connected to the suspended sentences for the offences in August last year.  His Honour revoked the bonds and imposed a sentence of 6 months gaol for the assault and 8 months gaol for the intimidation.  His Honour dated both sentences from 18 June 2012.  So far as the later offences were concerned, for the common assault and for the intimidation his Honour sentenced Mr Francis to 9 months imprisonment.  He commenced those sentences at the expiry of the earlier sentences, namely on 17 February 2013.  Both overall sentences expired on 16 November 2013.  For those two 9 month sentences, his Honour fixed non-parole periods of 6 months which expired on 16 August 2013.  In commencing the sentences on 18 June 2012, his Honour had taken into account the fact that Mr Francis had been in custody since that date.  
4I can well understand the overall sentences imposed by his Honour.  Mr Francis has a long criminal record which includes many assaults, affrays, offences against police and instances of contravening apprehended domestic violence orders.  He has received fines, community service orders, suspended sentences and bonds.  I should add, that reminds me, that for the contravene domestic violence order, his Honour Magistrate McRobert imposed a good behaviour bond for 2 years under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  The victim of many of his offences was the same person, Tracey Kelly.  I should briefly recount what happened on each occasion.  
5On 21 August 2011, they were both at home in Angonia when they started arguing.  Mr Francis pushed Ms Kelly in the back.  He took hold of her throat.  He then got a hammer and threatened her with the hammer.  She fled the scene.  On the second occasion (relying upon the findings of his Honour Magistrate McRobert made in resolving a factual dispute in a sentencing proceedings) Mr Francis was at their house when Ms Kelly asked him to leave.  He responded to this by brandishing a hammer and saying ""I'm going to break both your legs"".  He assaulted her by that gesture and further intimidated her by the use of the hammer.
6The combination of his criminal record and the accounts given of the violence he has inflicted on his partner, leave me with no doubt that the overall sentence, which amounted to 17 months, was appropriate.  However the effective non-parole period which his Honour fixed amounted to some 14 months.  That is about 82% of the overall sentence.  
7I myself would be inclined to fix the non-parole period envisaged as the normal one by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act namely 75%.  I would reduce the nonparole period to 12 months, which is just a little below the 75%.  Mr DJ Pheeney who appeared for Mr Francis urged me to reduce it further but the only special circumstances he could point to were his client's need for drug and alcohol counselling and his age.  He is 35 and has plenty of opportunities from the courts to rehabilitate himself.  I therefore propose to allow his appeal and to fix the effective non-parole period at 12 months.  
HIS HONOUR:  Yes; so Ms Siriwardana and Mr Pheeney I probably need to reduce the non-parole period from 6 months to 4 months so it expires 16 June.SIRIWARDANA:  That would be the perhaps simplest way of addressing it your Honour rather than--HIS HONOUR:  Or 17 June.SIRIWARDANA:  --try and take off time on each matter.HIS HONOUR:  Sorry?SIRIWARDANA:  That would be the simplest way to do it rather than altering every one of them.HIS HONOUR:  Okay.  In the formal orders which I make are these.  
8In respect of the appeals from both sentences imposed for the offences on 21 August 2011, under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), I determine those appeals against sentence by dismissing the appeal.  In respect of the appeal from the sentence imposed for contravening the domestic violence order on 22 May 2012, I determine that appeal against sentence by dismissing the appeal.  In respect of the two appeals from the sentences for common assault and intimidation committed on 22 May 2012, I determine those appeals against sentence by varying the sentences.  In each case I fix the non-parole period as 4 months to commence 17 February 2013 and to expire on 16 June 2013.  
HIS HONOUR:  Is that right, have I got it right?SIRIWARDANA:  Yes your Honour.  HIS HONOUR:  Mr Pheeney?PHEENEY:  Yes I will just look at it - yes your Honour, yes.SIRIWARDANA:  And does your Honour, formally for the record, uphold the sequence 3 section 9 bond for 2 years?HIS HONOUR:  I dismissed the appeal, so the appeal is dismissed. So that stands, that stands, as do the three sentences stand and two of them are varied.SIRIWARDANA:  Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Anything else?PHEENEY:  No your Honour, thank you.

2760308,Tuncbilek v R [2012] NSWCCA 224,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.

2JOHNSON J: I agree with Garling J. 

3GARLING J: Tarkan Tuncbilek applies for leave to appeal against his conviction by a jury for the offence of armed robbery of the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven on 10 August 2009, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

4For the reasons which follow, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, and that the appeal be dismissed.

Procedural history
5The Greater Building Society at Lake Haven on the Central Coast was, on 10 August 2009, the subject of an armed robbery, by three men whose faces were covered with either balaclavas or ski masks, but who were armed respectively with a sledgehammer, a crowbar and a handgun. $37,000 was taken during the robbery. The three men were seen escaping from the Building Society in a silver Subaru motor vehicle in which a fourth man had been waiting as the getaway driver.

6On 21 August 2009, the applicant was travelling in a silver Subaru motor vehicle with three other men when it was stopped by police at Auburn. In the car was found a sledgehammer, a crowbar and a replica handgun. As well, in a backpack belonging to the applicant, a balaclava and ski mask were found. 

7At that time, because the applicant was on parole in respect of a previous offence, he was entered into custody on 23 August 2009 following revocation of parole. The balance of his parole expired on 10 April 2010.

8Following further enquiries by Police, on 17 September 2009, the applicant was charged with a number of offences including the armed robbery of the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven. He was refused bail.

9After being committed for trial in the Local Court, the applicant, together with three co-accused, Mr Brough, Mr King and Mr Taotala, was presented for trial before Flannery DCJ on 3 November 2010. 

10Because a number of the applicant's co-accused had indicated that they would plead guilty to some of the charges, at the request of the parties the trial was adjourned until 10 November 2010. 

11On 5 November 2010, Mr Taotala and Mr King pleaded guilty to a series of offences including armed robbery of the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven. 

12The Crown determined that it would arraign Mr Brough and the applicant separately, and accordingly, the trial of the applicant commenced on Monday 8 November 2010. 

13The accused was arraigned that day on 11 charges. He pleaded guilty to four of the charges, and not guilty to the remaining seven. Three of the charges to which he pleaded guilty were those relating to his conduct on 21 August 2009 at Auburn at the time when he was arrested.

14A voir dire took place over the following two days. 

15On Wednesday 10 November 2010, the applicant was arraigned on an amended indictment. The indictment contained only five charges. The first charge was that the applicant on 31 July 2009 at Lisarow robbed the Bendigo Bank of $8,000 whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. The applicant pleaded not guilty to this charge. 

16The second charge was that on 10 August 2009, at Lake Haven, the applicant robbed the Greater Building Society of $37,000 whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. The applicant pleaded not guilty to this charge.

17There were then three charges which related to the events of 21 August 2009, when the applicant was arrested. To each of these charges the applicant pleaded guilty. Each of these charges related to 21 August 2009 and were that:

(a)the applicant was armed with a weapon, a replica pistol, with intent to commit an indictable offence, a robbery armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act;

(b)the applicant did allow himself to be carried in a conveyance, a silver Subaru Liberty ... bearing stolen registration plates ... knowing that the conveyance was taken without the consent of ... the owner of the conveyance, contrary to s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act;

(c)the applicant possessed a prohibited weapon, a replica firearm, without being authorised to do so by a permit, contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.

18After the arraignment finished, and the pleas were taken, the jury was empanelled. The Crown commenced its case on 10 November 2010, concluding with its final witness on 17 November 2010. After the closing of the Crown case, counsel who then appeared for the applicant, applied, in the absence of the jury, for a directed verdict of not guilty on the two armed robbery charges, relating to 31 July 2009 and 10 August 2009, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence upon which a jury properly instructed, could convict the applicant. 

19That application was refused. The applicant then called no evidence in his case. Counsel addressed. The trial Judge commenced her summing up on Thursday 18 November 2010, and the jury retired to consider its verdict on that day.

20The jury continued considering its verdict on Friday 19 November 2010. In the course of that day, the jury indicated to the trial Judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision on the charges. At 12.25pm on that day, the trial Judge gave a ""Black"" direction. 

21At about 3.55pm on 19 November 2010, the jury sent a note to the Court indicating that they wished to cease their deliberation and resume on the following Monday. The note requested the trial Judge to repeat her summing up on the Monday morning. 

22Her Honour, having taken any submissions from counsel for the Crown and for the applicant, adjourned the trial to Monday 22 November 2010. She excused the jury for the weekend. 

23On the morning of 22 November 2010, her Honour again summed up to the jury. This second summing was in substantially similar terms to that which she had given in the previous week. There were some minor differences because some matters, such as how the jury might ask questions, did not need to be repeated. The jury retired at about 11am on Monday 22 November 2010 to consider its verdict again. 

24At about 12.19pm, the jury returned and indicated that they had reached a verdict on the second count in the indictment, which related to the armed robbery of the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven, but they were still not able to reach a verdict on the first charge of armed robbery at Lisarow. 

25With the consent and agreement of the parties, and having satisfied herself that the jury were unable to reach a unanimous decision on that charge, the trial Judge gave the appropriate direction to enable a verdict on that charge to be returned by a majority. 

26After further deliberation, at about 2.24pm, the jury return and indicated that it was unable to reach a majority verdict on the first count in the indictment which related to armed robbery at Lisarow on 31 July 2009, but that it was of the unanimous opinion that the applicant was guilty of the second count in the indictment, namely, the armed robbery at Lake Haven on 10 August 2009.

27Her Honour discharged the jury in respect of the first count upon which they were unable to agree, and entered a conviction with respect to the second count. 

28The proceedings were stood over for sentence.

29On 25 March 2011, her Honour imposed the following sentences:

(a)On the offence of driving in a conveyance, Mercedes Benz, without the consent of the owner to which the applicant pleaded guilty on 8 November 2010 - a fixed term of imprisonment of 11 months to commence on 22 November 2009 and to expire on 21 October 2010;

(b)On the offence of being armed with a replica pistol with intent to commit indictable offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty on 10 November 2010 - a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 22 January 2010 and to expire on 21 July 2011;

(c)On the offence of being carried in the Subaru motor vehicle on 21 August 2009 to which the applicant had pleaded guilty - a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to commence on 22 January 2010 and to expire on 21 January 2011;

(d)On the offence of possession of a prohibited weapon on 21 August 2009 to which the applicant had pleaded guilty - a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 22 January 2010 and expiring on 21 July 2011 with a balance of term of 10 months so that the total sentence expired on 21 May 2012;

(e)In relation to the armed robbery offence to which the applicant had pleaded not guilty - a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 22 April 2010 and expiring on 21 April 2014, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months being a total sentence of 6 years and 3 months expiring on 21 July 2016.

30Her Honour found special circumstances.

31The total effective sentence on all counts was therefore one of 6 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 5 months. 

Proceedings on Appeal
32The applicant filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal on 16 March 2012. He drafted it himself and indicated that on the hearing of the application he proposed to appear for himself. The application was out of time. No objection was made to the Court extending time for the filing of that application and I propose that the Court do so.

33The Grounds of Appeal were somewhat discursive and consisted in part of stated ground and part of argument. It is perhaps best to set out the document in its entirety. At the commencement of the document, the applicant listed six short numbered paragraphs which were as follows:

""(1) Biometrics

(2) Identification

(3) Surveillance

(4) DNA

(5) Phone records

(6) Miscarriage of justice.""

34These seem to be the grounds of appeal. The following then appears in the Notice of Grounds of Appeal:

""(1) Judge failing to give proper direction to the jury based on available evidence presented at trial against me about circumstantial and what evidence based is against an accused, there was confusion of understanding by jury.

(2) Judge failed in addressing the jury about the law of evidence that was aloud [sic] in my trial, such as the evidence of the police who presented themselves falsely, such as me being convicted of armed robbery, the verdict of the jury is unreasonable. Judge erred in giving proper direction to jury.

(3) Biometrics was taken of me which police didn't use in court trial?

(4) I was arrested with fake gun replica 'revolver' witness described Gloc [sic] style weapon plus balaclava. I was in possession of ski mask, not balaclava.

(5) The only evidence against me is evidence is not to be in a stolen car which I was only ever on the day of my arrest. My cowies [sic - co-offenders] were under surveillance for two days. My only crime is the stolen car. 

(6) Crimes that were committed by offenders they pleaded guilty. The only time that I entered the vehicle was on my arrest day.""

35Accompanying the applicant's application for leave to appeal, and the grounds of the appeal, was a single page of written submissions. 

36Again, it is best if the entirety of those written submissions are set out:

""(1) The only time I entered vehicle used in previous was the day of 21 August 2009. The evidence clearly shows this account to be true. 

(2) 31 July 2009, 10 August 2009, 2x armed robberies occurred in the Central Coast area on banks. The two co-accused responsible to the crimes of armed robbery pleaded guilty. Phone records prove my innocence of involvement and evidence.

(3) The evidence of surveillance shows that my only involvement in a crime was on 21 August 2009 in Kerr Road, Auburn. Not on 31 July and 10 August in Central Coast area with accused people who pleaded guilty.

(4) Phone records even prove I wasn't in company with the other two co-accused who were always next to one another. They pleaded guilty because obviously they are guilty to the crimes they did.

(5) There has been a very seriously big miscarriage of justice against me. The evidence proves this against me biometric/description/identification. Basically evidence proves my say of my truth against jury and direction of judge.""

37In order to consider the application for leave to appeal, and the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to have an understanding of the Crown case presented at trial. 

38In so doing, for the purposes of this appeal, the only conviction with which this Court is concerned is that of the armed robbery at the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven on 10 August 2009. Although some of the facts relating to the other offences may be contextually relevant, it is appropriate to concentrate on the Crown case with respect to the Lake Haven armed robbery which was presented to the jury. It is necessary to keep in mind that the applicant presented no evidence to the jury, so the only evidence which the jury had was that presented by the Crown and the cross-examination engaged in by experienced counsel for the applicant. 

Crown case on Lake Haven armed robbery
39The Crown alleged that the applicant was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with other men, including Mr King and Mr Taotala (who pleaded guilty to the armed robberies), and that the enterprise was to rob the Bendigo Bank at Lisarow on 31 July 2009, and the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven on 10 August 2009. 

40It was the Crown case that there were significant similarities between these two robberies and the events of 21 August 2009, when the applicant was arrested at Auburn.

41Those similarities were, shortly stated, these:

(a)the armed robbery at Lisarow and Lake Haven was carried out by men armed with, or carrying, a red handled sledgehammer, a blue crowbar with a yellow sticker on it, and a pistol. As well, each of these robberies were carried out by men who escaped from the scene in a silver Subaru sedan.

(b)on 21 August 2009, the appellant was arrested in a stolen silver Subaru sedan with Mr King, Mr Taotala and Mr Brough. At the time of his arrest, as his plea of guilty indicates, he was in possession of a replica pistol and was intending to rob a credit union at North Ryde. In the car was found a piece of notepaper indicating the location of the credit union and some basic directions. A red handled sledgehammer and a blue crowbar with a yellow sticker was found in the boot of the vehicle. 

42The Crown case was a circumstantial one. The Crown case commenced with the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest on 21 August 2009. 

43The evidence before the jury was that from the morning of 21 August 2009, the silver Subaru motor vehicle in which the applicant was arrested, had been kept under either physical or else electronic surveillance. Mr King and Mr Taotala were seen in each other's company and in the Subaru for a good part of 21 August 2009. Mr Brough was first detected by surveillance at about 3.15pm on that day. The applicant, who was carrying a black and yellow backpack, first appeared on the electronic surveillance at about 3.28pm riding a bicycle in an easterly direction along Kerr Parade in Auburn. A recording of the electronic surveillance footage from that time was tendered at the trial. 

44From about 3.30pm, for a period of four minutes, Mr King, Mr Taotala, Mr Brough and the applicant were seen, by an undercover police officer, walking south on Marion Street, Auburn from the vicinity of Kerr Parade. The applicant was pushing his bicycle. Outside 9 Marion Street, Auburn, the four men engaged in conversation during which time the applicant was seen to pull what was apparently a silver revolver out of the front of his trousers, and showing it to his three companions before replacing it down the front of his trousers. Further surveillance continued, during which time the men were sometimes in each other's company and sometimes not. 

45At about 4.04pm the four men were captured by electronic surveillance getting into the silver Subaru. The applicant occupied the rear passenger seat.

46A few minutes later, police stopped the Subaru as it travelled south on Kerr Parade. It appeared that the Subaru attempted to escape, but police vehicles blocked it effectively.

47The four men were removed from the vehicle. Because capsicum cartridges had been fired into the rear window of the Subaru, the applicant was found to be unconscious. An ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital.

48The Subaru was searched carefully, a video recording of the search was taken and it was tendered at trial. 

49As earlier indicated, the search revealed that in the rear luggage compartment of the Subaru there was ""Trojan"" brand sledgehammer with a red handle and black rubber grip, a blue ""Mumme"" brand crowbar with a yellow sticker on it, and a machete attached to a vehicle windscreen sunshade deflector. Also in the boot were the legitimate registration plates for the motor vehicle. The registration plates displayed on the motor vehicle at the time it was stopped were stolen from another silver Subaru some days earlier.

50A black and yellow backpack was recovered from the area backseat of the car which contained a black ""Magic"" brand ski mask, a black full-face balaclava and a black spray paint can. 

51When Mr Taotala was searched, he was found to have in his pocket a handwritten note which read ""CREDIT UNION 1/3 Julius Avenue, North Ryde"". The note also had some further words ""off Epping Road to Rivett Road"" which was circled. 

52The notepaper upon which this note was written was particularly characteristic. It featured a black border with word ""Maggie"" printed in black with Asian characters underneath. The bottom corners feature images resembling Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The note was tendered to the jury. 

53Within a few hours of the arrest, police executed a search warrant at Mr King's residential premises. Photographs taken at the premises were tendered at the trial. The photographs included images of a notepad which identical paper to the note found on Mr Taotala at the time of the arrest. As well, a street directory opened at a map of North Ryde and surrounding suburbs, was found on a table in the premises. 

54Photographs taken in the basement carpark of Mr King's residential premises showed an area where black spray paint was on the floor and wall.

55Items from the silver Subaru were submitted for DNA analysis. DNA recovered from the ski mask and balaclava found in the black and yellow backpack, and a swab from the rear offside interior door handle of the Subaru, adjacent to where the applicant was observed to be sitting at the time of arrest, was found to match the DNA profile of the applicant. The sledgehammer handle, the crow bar and the machete handle could not be successfully tested for DNA. 

56It is appropriate to record here, that in front of the jury, the applicant admitted, by pleading guilty, to the three offences relating to the circumstances of the arrest on 21 August 2009, including that he was armed with a replica pistol with intent to commit an indictable offence (namely, an armed robbery), that he was travelling in a stolen motor vehicle and that he had possession of the relevant pistol.

57It was the Crown case that two armed robberies which had occurred on the Central Coast within a few weeks prior to the arrest of the applicant bore striking similarities to the events of 21 August 2009, such that it was submitted to the jury that it would conclude that the applicant was jointly responsible for those two armed robberies. 

58Before the jury, when dealing with the two armed robberies, the Crown presented evidence which included evidence from a police officer that Mr King and Taotala had admitted their involvement in both the armed robberies at Lisarow and Lake Haven. It was also noted that Mr Brough, the fourth gentleman found in the motorcar on 21 August 2009, had not been charged with respect to either of the two armed robberies.

59The Crown also tendered CCTV footage of each of the armed robberies.

Armed robbery of Bendigo Bank at Lisarow
60The CCTV footage showed that only two men entered the Bendigo Bank at Lisarow. Both were wearing balaclavas. One man was armed with a red handled sledgehammer, which he used to smash the glass panel adjacent to an automatic teller machine and gain entrance to the office area of the Bank. It was the Crown case that the other man on the CCTV footage was armed with a blue crowbar with a yellow marking and a black handgun which was used to threaten staff and customers of the Bank.

61The Crown submitted to the jury that, by reference to a comparison chart prepared by police, which was admitted as an exhibit, the red handled sledgehammer and the crow bar with a yellow sticker located in the silver Subaru on 21 August 2009, were identical with those weapons used at Lisarow. 

62The two men were seen escaping from the Bendigo Bank at Lisarow in a silver Subaru in which a third man was waiting as a get away driver. The silver Subaru carried registration plates, which it was agreed at the trial, had been stolen the previous day. They were different from the stolen registration plates on the silver Subaru in which the applicant was a passenger on 21 October 2007.

63The Crown presented mobile phone records to the jury of the applicant's mobile phone service. Although the relevant phone number was subscribed in the name of ""Therese Haynes of Waterloo"", it was the Crown case that because the number appeared on the contact lists of each of the three men arrested with the applicant on 21 August 2009, and also the applicant's mother, that it was the applicant's phone number. 

64A phone call was made from that phone number after the armed robbery of the Bendigo Bank at about 5.26pm, which bounced off a mobile phone tower at The Entrance on the Central Coast.

Armed robbery of the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven
65The Crown case, which was presented to the jury, with respect to this armed robbery was that at about 4.45pm on 10 August 2009, three men entered the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven armed respectively with a sledgehammer, a handgun and a crowbar. Each of the men wore either a balaclava or a ski mask. 

66According to the CCTV footage, the sledgehammer was used to smash a glass door separating the customer area from the tellers' area and the handgun and crowbar were used to threaten staff and customers. 

67The CCTV footage showed that the sledgehammer had a red handle and that the crowbar, which was blue, had a yellow marking or sticker on it. Police prepared, and the Crown tendered, comparison charts in respect of the red handled sledgehammer, the blue crowbar with the yellow sticker located in the silver Subaru on 21 August 2009, which highlighted similarities with the items shown on the CCTV footage of this robbery. 

68It was the Crown case that one of the offenders on the CCTV footage was Mr Taotala, who was wearing a blue jumper with distinctive trim, and who was carrying, and wielding, the sledgehammer. In order to identify Mr Taotala, the Crown also relied upon a comparison between the CCTV footage at the Building Society and the surveillance footage taken on 21 August 2009. Similarities in the jumper being worn on the two occasions were noted by the Crown.

69The offender shown on the CCTV footage carrying the handgun, which the Crown submitted to the jury was probably the applicant, was a person wearing a long-sleeved top with green and dark coloured horizontal stripes. Two eyewitnesses gave evidence that, by observation through the eyeholes of the balaclava, this offender had brown or dark eyes with olive or dark coloured skin. Another eyewitness, based on the offender's manner of speaking, expressed the view that the offender was of Lebanese descent. He was described by the eyewitnesses as ""athletically built"", weighing about 85-90kg, ""agile"", ""thin"" and at least taller than 5'9"" and up to 6'2"", that is, 176cm - 188cm.

70The third offender carrying the crowbar, who was seen on the CCTV footage wearing dark clothing, was described by one eyewitness as athletically built, like the other offenders and of similar height. 

71Again, as with Mr Taotala, the Crown submitted to the jury that it could compare the CCTV footage of the three men in the armed robbery with the surveillance footage of 21 August 2009, and compare the height, build and profile of the applicant with the physical features of the offender with the handgun. The Crown submitted that the jury should infer that the offender with the handgun at the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven was the applicant.

72The evidence suggested that the three men who entered the Greater Building Society escaped from the scene in a silver, sporty, apparently new, motor vehicle. It was the Crown case that this was the silver Subaru in which the applicant was ultimately arrested.

73The Crown tendered evidence of the phone records which showed that the applicant made a number of calls both prior to the armed robbery, the last of which was at 2.46pm and following the armed robbery, the first of which was at 5.37pm, which bounced off mobile phone towers at Morisset and Wyee on the Central Coast. As well, the telephone records showed that in the period between the first armed robbery at Lisarow and the day upon which the applicant was arrested, the applicant made 40 phone calls and sent 14 text messages to Mr King's mobile phone. 

The applicant's case
74Although the applicant did not give evidence at the trial, his counsel established a number of facts through cross-examination of the Crown witnesses. Those facts included:

(a)at all times from 21 August 2009, the applicant denied being involved in either of the two armed robberies;

(b)the applicant, whilst he may have been in the Central Coast area on the days of the armed robbery, because of the telephone records, was also in the Central Coast area on a number of other days in July 2009;

(c)whilst the telephone records established a connection between the applicant and Mr King, they did not establish any connection between the applicant and Mr Taotala. There was a strong connection between Mr King and Mr Taotala established from mobile phone records.

(d)the DNA evidence which established the applicant's DNA on the ski mask and balaclava found in the backpack in the motor vehicle, and his DNA on the nearside door handle of the motor vehicle, was entirely consistent with the fact, which was established by other means, that the applicant was in the motor vehicle on 21 August 2009, and that he had pleaded guilty to charges which were consistent with the finding of balaclava and the ski mask;

(e)there were significant differences between the two armed robberies. There were only three people involved in the armed robbery at Lisarow as opposed to four at Lake Haven. As well, the third person identified as the driver at Lisarow, was clearly not the applicant. In addition there was evidence connecting a Mr Fadi Nabouche to the purchase of the sledgehammer left behind at the Lisarow scene. Mr Nabouche was related to Mr King;

(f)the replica revolver found in the silver Subaru was not the handgun used in the robberies at Lisarow and Lake Haven, it was of an entirely different appearance.

Interlocutory judgment
75In the course of the trial, and prior to 10 November 2009, objection was foreshadowed by counsel for the applicant to the admission of evidence, as either tendency or coincidence evidence, of the arrest and circumstances surrounding the arrest, on 21 August 2009, to prove the earlier two robberies.

76Objection was taken as well with respect to other counts in the indictment, but these objections, which were in part successful, are no longer relevant. 

77On 11 November 2010, the trial Judge delivered judgment in which she held that there was no basis for the admissibility of the evidence as tendency evidence, but that the evidence could be admitted as coincidence evidence.

78In her judgment, her Honour noted that the Crown sought to lead evidence, as coincidence evidence, pursuant to s 98(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, of:

(a)the facts, matters and circumstances surrounding the applicant's arrest on 21 August 2009, including that the vehicle in which he was arrested was a stolen silver Subaru, he was in possession of an imitation revolver, gloves, balaclava, a red handled sledgehammer, a blue crowbar and a machete;

(b)that on 31 July 2009, the Bendigo Bank at Lisarow was robbed in circumstances where offenders were wearing gloves and a balaclava, one was carrying a red handled sledgehammer and the other was carrying a blue crowbar with a yellow sticker on it and a pistol, and that the robbers escaped in a silver Subaru with stolen number plates; and 

(c)on 10 August 2009, the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven was robbed by three men wearing gloves and balaclavas, one was carrying a red handled sledgehammer, one carrying a blue crowbar with a yellow sticker and one carrying a pistol. The armed robbers also escaped in a silver Subaru which was carrying stolen registration plates.

79In her judgment her Honour noted that in accordance with s 98 of the Evidence Act, she needed to be satisfied that appropriate notice had been given. There was no issue about this matter. Secondly, she noted that she needed to be satisfied that the evidence would have significant probative value. Her Honour then noted that s 101 of the Evidence Act, required her to determine whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it might have on the applicant.

80Her Honour found that the evidence had significant probative value. She found that evidence would, as counsel for the applicant had submitted, also have a prejudicial effect on the accused. Her Honour then weighed up the balance between the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the evidence and concluded in the following terms:

""There is no doubt that placing the evidence of the accused's other criminal activity before the jury will have a prejudicial effect on the accused, but I consider that the probative value of the evidence does substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect it may have on the accused, particularly as I will direct the jury that:

(i) they must only use the evidence that the accused committed counts [relating to his arrest on 21 August 2009] to determine whether the circumstances involving in the commission of those acts are so similar to the acts that the Crown says amount to the offences alleged, that they would conclude that the accused committed the offences charged; and

(ii) that it would be completely wrong to reason that the because the accused has committed one crime, he is therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason must have committed the offences.""

Grounds of appeal
Jury directions - Grounds 1 and 2
81As I have earlier set out, the grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant in his filed notice, it is unnecessary to set them out again. It appears in Grounds 1 and 2, that the applicant complains that the trial Judge failed to give a proper direction to the jury about circumstantial evidence and the use which might be made of coincidence evidence. 

82The Judge's summing up to the jury on circumstantial evidence, the process of drawing inferences, and the proper use of coincidence evidence, were directions of law which, in their terms, complied appropriately with the relevant authorities, and did not misstate the law. 

83On the contrary, they correctly stated the law. They were correct. 

84It is to be recalled that the summing up was delivered on two separate occasions. So far as the directions of law were concerned, they were repeated in substantially identical terms. 

85The applicant was represented at the trial by experienced counsel. It is relevant to note that at the conclusion of each summing up delivered by her Honour, counsel for the applicant did not object to the terms of her Honour's summing up. He did not submit that the summing up gave incorrect directions of law, nor did he seek any redirection of the jury. 

86I can detect no error of law in her Honour's summing up on these directions, and accordingly would not uphold any appeal on the basis of these Grounds.

Biometrics - Ground 3
87The applicant complains that although after his arrest police undertook biometric measurement of his height, these were not presented to the Court. 

88The first witness called by the Crown was Detective Senior Constable Kendall. He was the officer in charge of the investigation into the armed robberies at Lisarow and Lake Haven, and also was in charge of the arrest of the applicant on 21 August 2009. 

89In evidence Det Const. Kendall indicated that because the applicant was taken from the scene of the arrest to hospital, he did not accompany the other three men who were arrested to the police station. 

90The Crown did not tender in chief any evidence of any detail which related to the biometric features of any of the three men taken back to the police station, nor did they tender in chief any evidence of the biometric measurements which the applicant claims were taken of him. The height measurements of the four men arrested on 21 October 2009, were not relied upon by the Crown. 

91It is clear that there was, however, evidence of the fact that biometric measurements were taken at the police station by Acting Sergeant Leto. Evidence of that fact was elicited from Detective Senior Constable Hennessy in cross-examination by the counsel for the applicant.

92After Detective Senior Constable Hennessey's evidence was complete, and when Acting Sergeant Lester gave evidence, the Crown elicited from him that he conducted forensic procedures and biometric measurements on each of the three people in the Subaru at the time of they returned to the police station after their arrest. Again, the precise measurements were not elicited by the Crown. 

93However, in cross-examination counsel for the applicant elicited evidence that Mr Taotala was 181.5cm tall, Mr Brough was 176cm tall and Mr King was 179cm tall. There was no evidence elicited in the course of the evidence of either police officer that any biometric measurements were taken of the applicant. 

94In submission to the jury, the Crown did not rely upon these measurements in any way. No reference was made to them by counsel for the applicant and they were not mentioned in the summing up.

95If there were biometric measurements carried out upon the applicant, as this ground of appeal appears to assert, then that fact would have been known to the applicant, and to his counsel. No evidence was elicited of those facts in cross-examination, and no evidence was tendered to the jury of those facts.

96In all of the circumstances, there is no basis for any complaint with respect to the conduct of the trial by reason of the asserted inappropriateness of the Crown failing to lead any evidence of the applicant's height. 

97I would not uphold this ground of appeal.

Fake pistol and ski mask - Ground 4
98The applicant seems to submit that the case against him could not succeed because the revolver with which he was found was not identical with the earlier robberies, and as well, only balaclavas had been used in the earlier robberies, whereas he was found in possession of a ski mask. 

99It was clear that the Crown did not contend that the replica revolver found on the applicant at the time of his arrest on 21 August 2009, was the same as the weapon used in the two armed robberies at Lisarow and Lake Haven. 

100As well, the applicant's counsel drew attention to and strongly highlighted, the differences between the weapon with which the applicant was found on 21 August 2009, and the weapon used in the two armed robberies. He submitted to the jury that this was a significant difference between the events, and was a feature to which they should have careful regard for the purpose of rejecting the Crown's case. He submitted to the jury (T.377):

""The toy or replica pistol, which you've got the report on that was tendered through Detective Kendall, which was in [the applicant's] possession - and he has pleaded to possession of that - that's not the same weapon said to have been used in the other two robberies. It had recently been spray painted and it was a revolver type weapon, and you'll remember the description of the weapon at the Lake Haven robbery and that being: square, looking like a police-issue handgun.""

101The relevance to the Crown case of the fact of the applicant being in possession of a handgun on 21 August 2009, was not that it was the same weapon which had been used in the Lisarow and Lake Haven robberies. Rather, the Crown case was that in the robbery which was intended to be undertaken on 21 August 2009, as in the two previous robberies, they had each been conducted, or were to be conducted, by the participants using a red handled sledgehammer, a blue crowbar with a yellow label and a handgun. 

102The significance of the issue of whether what was being worn during the robberies, that is, either a ski mask or a balaclava, is somewhat elusive. The applicant's backpack on 21 August 2009, contained both a ski mask and a balaclava. Either could be used to cover a face and conceal an identity. The faces of the robbers in the two armed robberies were covered over by what appears to be a balaclava. But nothing turned on whether it was a balaclava or a ski mask. What was relevant, and a circumstance to which it was proper for the jury to have regard, was that on each occasion the faces of the robbers were, or were intended to be, fully covered. 

103I can detect no error of a kind sufficient to give rise to any successful appeal with respect to this ground.

104The balance of the grounds relate to arguments about the facts. In short, they point out that there was insufficient connection between the fact that the applicant was found in the stolen car on 21 August 2009 and the previous robberies. It is convenient to consider these matters of fact as forming a basis for a ground of appeal, which is earlier referred to obliquely, and that is, whether in all the circumstances, the conviction is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to all the evidence: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Unreasonable or unsupported verdict
105When this Court considers whether or not the verdict of a jury was unreasonable, as that term is used in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is necessary for the Court to make its own independent assessment of the evidence at the trial, both as to its sufficiency and quality: SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [14] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ; Morris v R [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454 at [19]-[20] per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. 

106In M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said at [6]:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the Court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict... Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the Court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence ... and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'. ""

107Any assessment of an appeal pursuant to this Ground, reflects the starting point that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses: M at [7] per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ. As their Honours said at [9]:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a Court of Criminal Appeal, that the Court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

108The case against the applicant brought by the Crown was a circumstantial one. The appropriate approach to whether a verdict is unreasonable in such a case was discussed by this Court in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [52] where McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Latham and Rothman JJ agreed, said:

""52 When, as here, the case against the accused is entirely or substantially circumstantial, 'the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused': Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 104 (Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ) citing Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634; see also Plomp v The Queen [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252. That statement of principle is uncontroversial. It is really 'no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt': Knight v The Queen [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502 (Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) quoting Shepherd at 578 (Dawson J). 

53 At the same time, the trier of fact must bear in mind that a circumstantial case is to be considered holistically: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ). Putting to one side for the moment 'indispensable' intermediate facts ..., it would be wrong for a jury to acquit an accused merely because it harbours reasonable doubts about some inculpatory evidence, though it ignores or unduly minimises other, more compelling evidence of the accused's guilt. As it is often the case that 'one piece of evidence ... resolves doubts as to another' (Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 535 (Gibbs CJ and Mason J)), it is necessary to weigh and consider the totality of the evidence: Hillier at [48]-[49]. In doing so, the finder of fact ought not stretch credulity or engage in tortuous reasoning in order to explain away each and every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA).""

109When the police stopped the stolen silver Subaru sedan on 21 August 2009, the evidence was overwhelming that the four men in the vehicle were on their way to commit an armed robbery at the premises of a credit union at North Ryde. Inside the car each of the participants had, or had access to, a balaclava or ski mask to cover their face and protect their identity. The tools to give effect to the robbery were the replica handgun, of which the applicant was in possession, a red handled sledgehammer and a blue crowbar with a yellow sticker.

110There was evidence of significant contact between some, but not all, of the four men in the motor vehicle leading up to that date. As well, the four were seen intentionally together and getting into the motor vehicle shortly before it was stopped by police.

111The vehicle was bearing stolen registration plates, which it was accepted, had been stolen from another silver Subaru vehicle. 

112Two of the occupants of the vehicle, Mr King and Mr Taotala, pleaded guilty to carrying out the armed robbery at the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven. The features of that armed robbery were that it was carried out by four men whose faces were covered, three weapons were used, namely, a red handled sledgehammer, a blue crowbar with a yellow sticker and a handgun, a fourth man acted as the driver of the getaway vehicle, which was a stolen silver Subaru sedan bearing stolen registration plates. Although these were not the same as those on the car on the day of the arrest, they also had been stolen from a silver Subaru sedan. 

113There was evidence from the mobile telephone records that the applicant was in the Central Coast area and using his mobile telephone, where Lake Haven is located, before and after the robbery of the Greater Building Society at Lake Haven, but not during the period when the robbery was in progress.

114The CCTV footage of that robbery, and the surveillance footage of the applicant on 21 August 2009, albeit not as extensive as of some of the other individuals arrested on that day, nevertheless enabled a comparison to be made as to whether there were any similarities or dissimilarities between the individuals involved in the Lake Haven robbery, and those arrested on 21 August 2009. 

115Allowing for each of the facts established in cross-examination by counsel for the applicant, to which I have earlier referred, I am of the view that there is no reasonable hypothesis which is consistent with the applicant not being involved in the armed robbery at Lake Haven, having regard to all of the evidence in the case. The facts strongly pointed to an identity in the numbers of robbers, the weapons used, and the get away car being used with false registration plates. These were not mere chance occurrences. They did not occur without a relationship between them.

116In other words, I am of the view that this was a very strong case against the applicant. Not only was it open to the jury to convict but I am not left in any doubt at all of the applicant's guilt of the offence of the armed robbery at Lake Haven.

117I am of the opinion that the verdict of the jury was not unreasonable, nor was it unsupported by the evidence. On the contrary, it was a strong case, one about which I have no doubt as to the applicant's guilt.

118I would not uphold any ground of appeal upon the basis that the jury's verdict was unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act.

Orders
119I would propose the following orders:

(1)Extend time for the filing of an application for leave to appeal to 23 March 2012.

(2)Grant leave to appeal.

(3)Appeal dismissed.

2760315,Colbalt v R [2012] NSWDC 305,"Judgment


1Brook Cobalt is a teenager who is said to have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and oppositional defiance disorder. Probably related to those disorders, over about 10 days or so in February this year she embarked on a spree of uncontrolled behaviour which became criminal. She was charged and came before the [place] Children's Court on 11 July 2012 before a magistrate. For most of the offences his Honour made a probation order. For one of the offences his Honour ordered her to enter into a good behaviour bond. For one of the offences his Honour imposed a control order but suspended it. Brook Cobalt has appealed against the severity of her sentences to the District Court.

HIS HONOUR: I will just depart from my reasons. Mr Barnes, am I right in thinking - and I may not be, I don't know - do you contest the probation orders at all? Are they being appealed from? Do you want to think about it and get instructions?
BARNES: Your Honour, my instructions were mostly in relation to the suspended control order.
HIS HONOUR: I gathered that.
BARNES: Yes. As I understand the approach that the magistrate took was that the contravene personal violence orders and the subsequent assaults were more serious than the initial assault in relation to the--
HIS HONOUR: I can understand that. I just need to know what I'm actually dealing with. Are you inviting me to - are you appealing from the probation orders? Now you may know the answer to that now or you may want to defer the answer until you get instructions. I just need to know whether I'm dealing with only two appeals, or one appeal perhaps, from the suspended sentence, so to speak, or whether I'm dealing with appeals for all of them, which in fact have been included in the appeal notice.
BARNES: Yes your Honour. They have all been included in the appeal notice. The young person instructs me in relation to the suspended control order your Honour and also in relation to the fine.
HIS HONOUR: Okay, and anything else?
BARNES: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: So are you seeking leave to withdraw the appeals from the probation orders and the bond?
BARNES: Yes your Honour.

2Although Brook Cobalt appealed from all of the sentences, Mr A J Barnes who appears for her in this appeal indicates that she no longer wishes to press her appeal against the probation orders and the bond. She maintains her appeal against the suspended control order and a fine which was imposed for one of the offences. The fine was $150. 

HIS HONOUR: Ms Siriwardana, do you oppose leave to withdraw?
SIRIWARDANA: No your Honour, not opposed.

3Mr Barnes has sought leave to withdraw the appeals from the probation orders and the bonds. That application is not opposed by Ms I Siriwardana, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, and I grant leave to withdraw those appeals. 

4The result is that there are two appeals, one from the suspended control order and one from the fine. The fine was imposed for a larceny offence and the suspended control order was imposed for assaulting police. 

5I need to say a little about what kind of behaviour Brook Cobalt engaged in to bring about these charges. She apparently had a falling out with another girl at school called May Grey. The falling out was so serious that Brook Cobalt was served with an apprehended personal violence order. That happened on 10 August 2011. They were both at the same school although a year apart. 

6On 13 February this year Brook Cobalt started screaming at May Grey and threatening her. She was very abusive to her during the day. At one stage Brook Cobalt grabbed May Grey's hair and pushed her knee into the girl's face a number of times. She then punched her. Despite members of staff trying to stop her she still tried to punch the other girl. She persevered in this behaviour. That resulted in a charge of common assault and a charge of contravening the personal violence order. For the common assault his Honour imposed the good behaviour bond under s 33(1)(b) of the Children (Criminal Procedure) Act 1987 (NSW). For contravening the personal violence order his Honour ordered Brook Cobalt to go onto probation for 12 months.

7The next morning Brook Cobalt was suspended from school. She was told to leave the school ground. She abused the School Principal but on her way she ran into May Grey again and a confrontation was about to happen when a teacher stood between them. Brook Cobalt attempted to push her way past the teacher and she tried to punch May Grey. The Principal stepped in as well. Brook Cobalt grabbed the Principal by the top of her dress and pulled her backwards. She grabbed hold of May Grey and tried to kick and punch her. The other teacher who had first intervened tried to grab Brook Cobalt who threw a punch at that teacher and narrowly missed. That behaviour resulted in three charges of common assault, one against May Grey, one against the School Principal and one against the teacher. It also resulted in a charge of contravening - again - the personal violence order. For all of those offences his Honour imposed probation orders for 12 months. 

8Just over a week later Brook Cobalt turned up at a video store in [place]. She was with four other girls. She stole an item from the video store. It was worth $15. She was arrested by the police later that day. They tried to put her into the back of the police truck. While that was happening Brook Cobalt thrashed out again and kicked one of the police in her stomach. She had previously tried to get away from the police. That behaviour resulted in charges of assault police and resist arrest.

9When she was at the [place] Police Station she yelled at one of the police officers saying, ""I know where you live, I have cousins in [place] that have just been released from gaol and they will come and kill you."" She persisted, ""I will give you whatever, I know where you live, you will get a bullet."" Referring to another police officer she said, ""And that other police officer with the kid, I'm going to get her and kick her kid."" When the other police officer entered, the one whom Brook Cobalt had kicked in the stomach, she said, ""I'm gonna fucking get you, I know where you fucking live and your fucking daughter."" She persisted in saying, ""I'm gonna get your daughter, string her fucking up and slit her fucking throat and guts while you watch her, then I'm gonna fucking kill you."" As she did that she made a throat cutting gesture with her hand. She persevered saying, ""Yes I fucking am, I'm going to kill your daughter."" Both of the police officers concerned were women. Understandably her abusive language resulted in charges of intimidating the police. His Honour imposed a probation order on Brook Cobalt for the offences of resisting police and intimidating the police and imposed a control order for 16 months for the offence of assaulting police but suspended that control order. 

10Brook Cobalt has no criminal record. There is a helpful report from Juvenile Justice. One of the authors is Carmel Carmine, a Juvenile Justice officer from [place]. The report is dated 10 July 2012, the day before she was dealt with by his Honour. Her parents are separated. She said she wants to live with her mother and her mother's partner. The report records the diagnoses which I referred to at the outset of these remarks. The mother acknowledged that Brook Cobalt's behaviour had got out of control. There have been discussions about her being admitted to a psychiatric hospital but it has not yet reached that stage. Brook's father lives in [place] and maintains regular contact. Brook Cobalt was apparently regularly suspended from school but during suspensions has undertaken distance education. She is doing well in her distance education and is approximately 6 weeks ahead of the planned lesson schedule. Brook Cobalt explained to Ms Carmine that she has been involved in what she described as a negative peer group in [place]. That association was a contributing factor to her behaviour. She wants to recommence physical fitness and is apparently a very good long distance runner. There is a treating psychiatrist, Dr [name]. She regularly sees a mental health consultant at the Community Adolescent Mental Health in [place]. She is presently on prescribed medication Zoloft and Epilim.

11She has been supervised since 27 February 2012 by Juvenile Justice. Ms Carmine's records that since the supervision commenced, Brook Cobalt ""has complied with all directions from this agency including, attending and participating in counselling, educational programs and has undertaken an anger management course"". She is apparently wanting to improve her behaviour. Ms Carmine was of the opinion that she will need to continue with regular mental health interventions. She wants to gain her Year 10 School Certificate. Ms Carmine notes that Brook Cobalt is ""now able to demonstrate that she has insight into her negative behaviours and wants to continue to address the issues as outlined ... this report. [Brook] has also reported a commitment with counselling, education and case management from this agency and Mission Australia."" The recommendation was that she be dealt with by way of a good behaviour bond and probation orders. The report acknowledged that a suspended sentence would be a harsher available alternative.

12Mr Barnes points out that the focus of his attention on the appeal is the fine of $150 and the suspended control order. Given the extraordinarily bad and criminal behaviour of this teenage girl earlier this year but her very promising report in July this year I would not want to dispose of this appeal without hearing fresh evidence from Ms Carmine. I am happy for that to be in the form of oral evidence given in court. For that reason I propose to adjourn the proceedings to Monday 29 October 2012 at 10.00am for mention for the purpose of fixing a date next week for the conclusion of the hearing after hearing Ms Carmine and in the presence of Brook Cobalt.

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else I need to do?
SIRIWARDANA: No your Honour. In relation to this appeal your Honour or any other?
HIS HONOUR: No, in relation to this appeal.
SIRIWARDANA: No your Honour, that's all.

		12 March 2014",2012-10-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760318,R v Gurung [2012] NSWDC 272,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Renuka Gurung appears for sentence in respect of two offences. 

2The first offence was committed on 30 October 2010, when the offender made a false accusation with intent to subject ST to an investigation for an offence of sexually assaulting the offender. The offence is contrary to section 314 of the Crimes Act 1900 and has a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.

3The second offence was committed on 2 November 2010, when the offender entered a building with intent to commit an indictable offence (intentionally damage the property of ST), contrary to section 114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900. A maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment is provided. There is no standard non-parole period provided in respect of either offence.

4Due to the protracted progress of this matter since trial, it is necessary to provide considerably more detail of that progress than would ordinarily be necessary. The delay is important to issues regarding remorse, contrition and rehabilitation.

5The offender was committed for trial on 28 June 2011. The trial commenced with pre-trial argument on 25 April 2012, in which it was submitted on behalf of the offender that the offender's police statement setting out the false allegation, dated 30 October 2010, and the offender's ERISP, dated 24 November 2010, should be excluded from evidence.

6Neither of the objections had any merit. The offender's statement and ERISP were ruled admissible on 26 April 2012, and a jury was then empanelled.

7The indictment contained four counts. The third and fourth counts, (2(b) and 2(c)), were each alternatives to Count 2(a). 

8Count 1 was the make false accusation offence already referred to. 

9Count 2(a) was an offence of attempt to break and enter the premises of ST with intent to commit a serious indictable offence: intentionally damage the property of ST in circumstances of aggravation, namely, being in company. 

10Count 2(b) was the same as Count 2(a), without the circumstance of aggravation.

11Count 2(c) has already been referred to.

12After the jury was empanelled and the offender placed in their charge, and before the Crown opened, there was an adjournment. After the adjournment, Mr Overall, counsel for the offender, indicated that his client wished to enter a plea of guilty in respect of Count 1 and the alternative Count 2(c). The Crown was prepared to accept the two pleas as discharging the indictment.

13The offender was again arraigned on those counts and pleaded guilty to Count 1, but despite expectations, continued a not guilty plea in respect of Count 2(c).

14In those circumstances the trial continued in respect of Count 2(a) and the alternative counts of 2(b) and 2(c).

15The Crown then opened and called ST as the first witness. His evidence was completed that day and the trial adjourned to continue on the following day, 27 April 2012.

16On that day, before the jury returned, Mr Overall again indicated that the offender wished to enter a plea of guilty in respect of Count 2(c).

17The offender was arraigned on that count in the presence of the jury and entered a plea of guilty.

18The Crown accepted the pleas as discharging the indictment.

19The Court then dealt with the pleas in accordance with section 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act, that is, it accepted the pleas in respect of Count 1 and Count 2(c), and found the offender guilty of each. The jury was then discharged.

20Section 157 subsection (2) provides that where the Court follows that procedure, the finding of guilt has the effect as if it were the verdict of the jury.

21A document entitled ""Agreed Facts on Sentence"" annexing the offender's statement to police dated 30 October 2010, and signed by the parties, including the offender, was then tendered, and the sentence hearing listed for Friday 8 June 2012.

22On that date, the Court heard evidence from Tanya Merhi, Probation and Parole Officer, and the offender. A psychiatric report from Dr Furst, dated 4 June, 2012, and references were tendered.

23However, by the time submissions were completed, it was after 4pm.

24While I had anticipated being able to complete the matter that day, as a result of the evidence there were clearly issues that required careful consideration.

25The offender was allowed bail from 27 April 2012 until 8 June 2012, particularly to facilitate the obtaining of a psychiatric report on her behalf.

26As I was not then available in Sydney until the week commencing 23 July 2012, the matter was adjourned for reasons on sentence to Friday 27 July 2012.

27At the time of the offences, the offender's presence in Australia was subject to a Student Visa. By the time of the trial, the Student Visa having expired, she remained in Australia subject to a Criminal Justice Visa.

28As all relevant material was before the Court on sentence, I said:
""The offence is a serious one, and it is inevitable that a term of imprisonment must be imposed, although I have not yet decided on the length of that, so there is no point, particularly in the circumstances where, if your client was to come back in seven weeks time, and I then imposed a sentence, she would have to serve the sentence after that seven weeks had already been spent in the community, subject to whatever bail conditions she has been on. So I think it is far more in your client's interests that I refuse her bail at this time. It is a matter for you whether you wish to make any submissions to the contrary.""

29Mr Overall made no application for bail, and it was refused.

30On 27 July 2012, the Court, having reflected on the issues, was prepared to impose sentences. However, Mr Overall sought leave to withdraw, as his and his instructing solicitor's instructions had been withdrawn. Leave was granted.

31Mr Killalea, solicitor, then appeared for the offender, and indicated that he had filed a notice of motion to withdraw the pleas and would be making an application for bail in the future, prior to the application to withdraw the pleas.

32The matter was inadvertently listed for a date when I was to be on circuit, and when the parties returned that day, I was asked to recuse myself from hearing the application to withdraw the pleas, which was refused. 

33In short, there was then an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of my refusal to recuse myself.

34The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 6 September 2012 indicates that that Court was not informed that both pleas occurred after the offender had been placed in the charge of the jury, and that the Court had followed the procedure set out in section 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

35The effect of following that procedure, and the findings of guilt having effect as though they were verdicts of the jury, the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain an application to withdraw the pleas of guilty.

36The matter returned to court before me on 14 September 2012, at which time I informed Mr Killalea of section 157 and my view as expressed above.

37To allow him to consider his client's position and the law, and the opportunity to obtain any further material on sentence, the matter was adjourned to the first Thursday I was again available in Sydney, being yesterday, 25 October 2012.

38No application was made, and no further material or submissions were made on sentence.

39As the Court was then involved in a trial, the matter was adjourned to today for sentence.

40The practical effect has been to defer the imposition of sentence from 27 July 2012 until today, a period of three months, and while the offender has remained in custody, not knowing the term of the sentence - a most unfortunate consequence.

41As previously indicated, the parties agreed on the facts on sentence, which annexed a copy of the offender's statement on 30 October 2010 containing the false accusation.

42I intend to refer not simply to the agreed facts on sentence, but in part, to the content of the statement, and also to the evidence of ST, which was already before the Court as a result of the conduct of the trial.

43The offender alleged that ST called her mobile phone at around midday on 29 October 2010, saying that he needed to speak to her about some documents that he had signed and that she had witnessed in February 2010.

44Her statement clearly indicates that she had no further contact with ST after witnessing the signing until the alleged phone call on Friday 29 October 2010 to her mobile phone at about midday.

45She stated that it was agreed that they would meet in the city after work at Martin Place. She alleged that ST collected her in his car from Martin Place after 5pm. 

46She left her house at 3pm, caught a train from Auburn to Wynyard Station, went to see a consultant to discuss courses she was doing, and applying for temporary residence in Australia. 

47She left the premises of a friend's uncle's office at about 5.15pm and walked for about five minutes to Martin Place, where she looked around to find ST. She observed him sitting in a dark grey coloured four-wheel drive, in the driver's seat.

48They then had a conversation which related to the alleged purpose of his phone call to her, as being to do with the documents that she had witnessed in February of 2010.

49They were said to have driven around the city area for fifteen to twenty minutes before he suggested going to a motel. In short, she indicated that she said she was not a prostitute, and declined the invitation to go to a motel.

50While there was further conversation, she indicated that ST became angry, his voice growing louder, as he continued to drive around the city; that while driving around the city, he grabbed her neck with his left hand and pulled her towards his lap. She said that, ""he was doing this to me for about ten to fifteen minutes"". 
""He is still driving, and then he used left hand and started to touch my boobs. He put his hand down my top. I was trying to push him away but he was too big. ST then put his left hand down my undies and touched me on the skin of my vagina, and then I threw his hand away. He was still driving at this stage around the city. He didn't put his fingers inside my vagina.""

51There was some further conversation and driving for a further three to five minutes before he stopped the car, and she opened the door and ran.

52She returned to her residence, and at 9pm made a call from a phone booth to Alan Ghadi, described in the facts as her then boyfriend.

53The documents that had been witnessed in February 2010 were an application being made by ST, through Alan Ghadi, for a loan in respect of the purchase of a motor vehicle.

54She said that she requested information from Mr Ghadi, which he at first declined to give her, but after she had informed him of what she alleged had happened to her, he said he would call her back when he had the application.

55The statement continues on to indicate that at 11pm that day, Mr Ghadi called her mobile, having found the paperwork in respect of the loan application, that he then brought it to her residence at 11.45pm, and Mr Ghadi then drove her to the Auburn Police Station.

56The statement indicates that it was signed by the offender on 30 October 2010 at 7.21pm. That is, in the circumstances of the content of her statement, there can be no doubt that the events that she alleged had occurred, occurred at the times indicated on 29 October 2010, and that her attendance at the police station was on that same date.

57In preparing the statement containing the allegation, the offender, after reading the jurat, said, ""How would people know if what was said is a lie?""

58ST resided on the 22nd floor of a unit building in Chatswood with his wife and their son. Access to that floor could only be obtained by using an access swipe card, unless someone within one of the units pressed the appropriate button within their unit to allow access to the building, and the lifts in particular.

59At about 10am on 2 November 2011, ST was at home with his wife and son. The son heard noise from the door area. ST observed the door handle to move and heard voices, at least one being female, outside, although he could not discern what was being said. He called Triple 0. His wife observed ST to ""sound full of stress and shaking"" when he spoke to the police, and was attempting to keep the door closed.

60When the police arrived, the offender, who ST knew only as Veronica, was standing outside his unit. ST gave evidence in the trial that he had only met Veronica on two occasions, the first being in February 2010 when she had witnessed his loan documentation, and she was introduced by Mr Ghadi as his girlfriend, and on a later occasion in September 2010, again at offices associated with Alan Ghadi.

61It was only after the offender's attendance at ST's residence on 2 November 2011 that police interviewed ST in relation to the alleged sexual assault.

62I note, since the date of that interview was not contained in the facts or in the evidence of ST at trial, that the Court has obtained the date from the document which was part of the court file from the committal proceedings.

63ST informed the police in the interview that he had never actually spoken to the offender; he did not know her telephone number, and had certainly never telephoned her. He denied having met her in the city, and said that at the relevant time he had been with his wife and child at Chatswood on the way to the Blue Mountains.

64The police investigation revealed CCTV footage from the Westfield Shopping Centre showing ST, his wife and son at a kebab store in the Food Court at about 4.55pm on 29 October 2010. 

65CCTV footage obtained from Caltex Petrol Station, Epping Road, depicts ST filling his car with petrol at about 5.52pm on 29 October 2010. 

66At 5.59pm on 29 October 2010, ST's vehicle was charged for using the M2 Motorway Toll at North Ryde Plaza, and at 6.14pm was charged for using the M7 Motorway Toll at the M2 Interchange Northwest.

67The facts indicate that it was an impossibility for ST to have committed the alleged offence against the offender, and as previously indicated, there can in the circumstances be no doubt about the date on which she alleged it occurred.

68On 24 November 2011, the offender attended Chatswood Police Station at the request of the investigating officer. She was charged and cautioned. She participated in an ERISP where she stated, inter alia, the following:
(i)That she was not attempting to break into the premises, she was just knocking;
(ii)If she gained access to the premises, she was going to write on the wall, ""He's a rapist"", or something like that;
(iii)Her mobile telephone number;
(iv)She was shown CCTV footage from the unit building at which ST resided in Chatswood, in which she identified herself entering the building;
(v)She had obtained ST's address from the finance application he had filled out and provided to Alan Ghadi;
(vi)Prior to attending ST's residential building at Chatswood, she and Alan Ghadi had attempted to call ST on numerous occasions without receiving an answer over a period of three to four days;
(vii)At the time of the alleged offences she was on a student visa;
(viii)She explained at the interview that she had followed others into the building and that a building manager or security person had given her access to the floor on which ST resided.

69Although during the interview she was confronted with relevant CCTV footage and information as to where ST was in fact at the relevant times according to her allegation, she continued to claim that her allegation was true.

70In the Court's view, where an allegation of an act of sexual misconduct is made against any individual, whether they be married or not, that allegation being false, it is a serious matter.

71The evidence in sexual assault matters is frequently one on one, and with the exception that ST was able to provide information that led to clear evidence that he could not have committed the offence, it is highly likely that he would in fact have been charged with the offence alleged, and potentially suffered serious consequences, possibly even imprisonment, and being put to considerable expense to defend himself.

72False allegations of this nature fundamentally undermine the justice system, and indeed, the credibility of complainants in sexual assault matters.

73Although the offence of enter building with intent to commit, an indictable offence, carries the same maximum term of imprisonment as the offence of making a false statement, in this matter it is noted that the offender essentially conned her way to the residential floor of ST and was unable in the circumstances to carry out her intention of writing on his walls.

74In those circumstances, considering the intention, I would assess the offence of enter building with intent as falling into the lowest range of seriousness for such offences.

75The Court has been provided with a Victim Impact Statement from ST as to the impact on him and his family. It underlines the significance and impact of false allegations such as this. However, there is nothing contained in the Victim Impact Statement which takes the impacts out of what might be ordinarily expected.

76In respect of subjective matters, the Court has before it evidence given by the offender on 8 June 2012; the references from Shreejan Shakya and Sevgi Selik, being Exhibit 5; a number of medical certificates, being Exhibits 3 and 4; and a psychiatric report from Dr Richard Furst dated 4 June 2012, being Exhibit 2.

77The offender is a twenty-four year old Nepalese woman who, prior to 8 June 2012, when bail was refused, was living alone in private rental accommodation. She is a single woman with no dependents or social supports in Australia. She maintained regular contact with her family, who reside overseas, and is said to have had a close and supportive relationship especially with her mother. She was born in Nepal and is the middle of three siblings of her parents' union.

78Her upbringing is said to have been marred by sexual abuse perpetrated by a family relative, which is reported to have had an ongoing emotional effect over the years.

79Her parents have been emotionally and financially supportive, and there was no history of domestic violence in the family.

80She married in Nepal at twenty-one years of age and came to Australia shortly afterwards in 2008 with her husband on a student visa. They separated within three months, her husband abandoning her, leaving her on her own to support herself.

81She found the transition to life in Australia difficult because she had no support, stable accommodation or employment.

82At the time of the Pre-Sentence Report she was then currently unemployed, but was not entitled to government financial assistance because she was a non-resident.

83She was, of course, by the time of the report, remaining in Australia subject to a Criminal Justice Visa.

84She is said to have completed her schooling in Nepal to a Year Twelve level. Following the completion of her equivalent Higher School Certificate, she has completed the Certificate 3 in Hairdressing and also a basic Cabin Attendant's training course in Australia.

85Before migrating to Australia on the Student Visa in 2008, she had worked for some period in her parents' shop.

86In Australia she reported a history of casual, unskilled employment as a waitress, hairdresser and housekeeper. Her last position of employment was said to have been in April 2012 as a housekeeper.

87Although the offender is largely the source of most of the information I have just referred to, and the Court entertains some doubts about the truthfulness of the offender, the Court accepts the subjective matters that have been referred to.

88There are two references, as indicated, the first from Mrs Shakya, who refers to having been the direct supervisor of the offender when she worked at the Quay Grande Suites as a room attendant. Mrs Shakya speaks well of the offender's integrity, honesty and loyalty. She has known the offender for approximately two and a half years and believes her conduct to be uncharacteristic, and that she sincerely and completely regrets it. 

89However, I note in respect of the suggestion that the offender sincerely and completely regrets her conduct that the reference does not state that that has been communicated to the referee by the offender. Indeed, when the referee speaks of conversations with the offender about the offences, it appears that the substantial impact as expressed to the referee is as to the impact and embarrassment to the offender from her conduct.

90The second reference, from Sevgi Selik, refers to having known the offender for two years as her landlord, and her belief that the offender sincerely regrets her conduct.

91As to conversations the referee has had with the offender, the reference contains:
""I know personally from conversations we have had since the commission of the offence that she is utterly despondent in the knowledge of the deleterious impact which a recorded conviction poses to pursuing a future in the fields of education and work.""

92Again, the reference appears to indicate the offender is more concerned with the effect on her rather than being remorseful or contrite in respect of the offences.

93The report of Dr Furst indicates, together with the medical notes, that the offender has suffered from depression since approximately 2009, and has received medication, in particular Zoloft, to assist her with her depression. She also suffers from alopecia. 

94Dr Furst was of the opinion that she has a major depressive disorder, with no indications of personality disorder, the depressive symptoms having developed in the context of her migrating to Australia and separating from her husband.

95Dr Furst indicates, in answering the question posed to him as to whether there were any mental health issues relevant at the time of the alleged offences:
""The difficulty she had in explaining her actions raises the real possibility that she was suffering from some type of psychosis at the time in question. Given that the depressive symptoms appear to have been present for the last two and a half years, I thought it probable that she was affected by her major depressive illness at the time in question before the Court, which may well have clouded her judgment and appreciation of the consequences of her actions.""

96One of the difficulties with Dr Furst's opinion is that, in his report, under the heading of ""Account of Index Offence"", he indicates that the offender had claimed to him that she could not recall the events in question, and that she could not recall how she was feeling at the time. She was unable to give a clear account of what she had been thinking in relation to the two offences. She said that she had been confused at the time and had trouble thinking clearly. Ms Gurung said that she believed what she told police at the time, ""but I wasn't thinking clearly...I am not sure about the time...I didn't know about court, it was my mistake"".

97Dr Furst said:
""She was distressed when recounting the events in question.  Ms Gurung said that she felt bad, embarrassed and frightened about what she had done and expressed remorse. She was open to counselling and mental health treatment to address her issues.""

98To the extent that Dr Furst's opinion that she may have been suffering from some type of psychosis depends on the offender's expressed inability to recall how she was feeling at the time and her inability to give a clear account of what she had been thinking in relation to the two offences. On her suggestion that she had been confused at the time and had trouble thinking clearly, the Pre-Sentence Report from Tanya Merhi dated 7 June 2012 casts some doubt.

99Ms Merhi, at the time of writing her report, had available to her Dr Furst's report, although she refers to it as a psychological report.

100Under the heading ""Attitude to the Offences"", she stated:
""In discussing the agreed facts pertaining to the offences, Ms Gurung agreed with the documents. She, however, appeared to justify her offending in claiming that she only attended the victim's residence in an attempt to speak with him and did not intend to cause him harm in any way. She further denied that the allegation she made in regard to being indecently assaulted by the victim was false, and rather advised that she could not recall the date of the incident. This, however, conflicts with the information provided in the psychological report dated 4 June 2012, where Ms Gurung claimed that she could not recall the events and was unable to give a clear account of what she had been thinking in relation to the above two offences. Further, Ms Gurung failed to demonstrate any insight into the impact of her actions upon the victim.""

101As a result of that particular passage of the Pre-Sentence Report, an audiovisual link was established on 8 June 2012, as Mr Overall, on behalf of the offender, wished to explore the basis on which Ms Merhi had made those comments.

102Although he had proposed to call the offender before evidence could be adduced from Ms Merhi, he acceded to the suggestion that it would be more appropriate to hear first from Ms Merhi before he put his instructions from the offender. When asked: ""Why do you say, 'She appeared to justify her offending'?"" Ms Merhi said:
""When discussing the offence with her, Renuka basically focused on why she attended the victim's residence rather than making any mention of what she did was wrong, or that her actions were unlawful. She appeared to have no acceptance of responsibility, so that's why basically I've put that she appeared to justify her offending rather than accept responsibility for her unlawful actions.""

103When referred to her statement that the offender had actually denied the allegation in respect of the indecent assault, Ms Merhi said:
""She denied that the allegation she made was false, so she rather advised that the incident did happen; however, she could not recall the date of the incident.""

104In respect of the offence of entering the premises with intent, Ms Merhi said that the offender did mention that she was attending the victim's house in order to graffiti on the walls that he was a rapist.

105This evidence was significant because the offender subsequently gave evidence and was taken by counsel to a reference in the Pre-Sentence Report that she claimed to the officer that she only attended the victim's residence to speak with him and did not intend to cause him harm in any way. Her response was to state: ""I just wanted to give him all the papers."" And subsequently: ""...when I had the interview with the police, I did say that I was thinking about making the graffiti, but from my heart I did not have that intention.""

106When asked about the evidence that she had told the Probation Officer that the allegation of indecent assault was not false, she said: ""As far as I remember, this question was not raised at all.""
""Q. What do you say about the allegation of indecent assault?

A. I have told Tanya that it was my fault, that I signed all the papers even before reading, and that I was sorry, and I wanted to apologise this to everyone.

Q. I am now asking you to tell the Court what is your attitude now to your allegation that you made to police that the victim indecently assaulted you? What is your attitude to making that allegation?

A. What I feel right now, what I want to say is that I'm extremely sorry for whatever I did, and I am sorry, I want to apologise to his family and also to the Court.

Q. You agree, do you, that you made the false allegation?

A. Yes, I do agree, and I have pleaded guilty.""

107Subsequently she said:
""Like I said before, I feel guilty and I have done mistake, and what I think that is, is all the allegation I have made will be carried out throughout his life and also throughout my life, and it can have that kind of long-term effect, and I regret about whatever happened.""

108It is difficult in the circumstances of her evidence and her statements to the pre-sentence officer to accept that her evidence provides any evidence of genuine remorse or contrition.

109In her evidence, she subsequently substantially contradicted the evidence of the victim ST as to his lack of contact with her, and also stated that she had had significantly more contact with him than he had said in his evidence, and which was also inconsistent with her false allegation. She said:
""I had always fed him, I had given him tea, and we were close, and he said he would give me a job, and did those kind of things...I was promised that I would be given at least twenty hours of job at...stock market...This was repeatedly promised by him, even when he came several times to my house.""

110When asked: ""Do you remember him saying he had only met you twice, do you remember him saying that?"" She said: ""I remember that, but he had met me many, many times. He used to come to my house.""

111I note that no such suggestion was made to ST during the course of his evidence, nor was any request made on the sentencing proceedings for ST to be recalled so that those matters could be put to him.

112It is also inconsistent with any genuine remorse that, subsequent to the pleas of guilty and the offender's evidence on sentence, and the matters that I have referred to in relation to the contents of the references, and in Dr Furst's report under the heading of ""Expressions of Remorse"", ""Ms Gurung has pleaded guilty to the offences and is very embarrassed and remorseful about her actions,"" that subsequently the offender, on 27 July 2012, indicated to the Court through her fresh legal representative, Mr Killalea, that she now wished to withdraw her pleas of guilty, whether that was possible or not.

113In the circumstances, the Court finds that there is no acceptable evidence of genuine remorse or contrition.

114That makes it difficult to find that there is a good prospect of rehabilitation, although that is not to say that there is no prospect.

115I note that the offender did not enter pleas of guilty until after she was in the charge of the jury, and the evidence of the victim had been completed. Although there was some utility in the pleas of guilty, the utility is much diminished by the lateness of the pleas. I will, however, take into account that a minimal discount for the utility of the pleas should still be allowed.

116The conduct of the matter since 27 June 2012 and the expressed intent to withdraw the pleas confirms the opinion that the Court had formed, on the evidence of Ms Gurung of 27 July 2012, that there is no evidence of genuine remorse or contrition.

117The Court was about to deliver the reasons on sentence on 27 July 2012. Despite the subsequent delay, the Court will impose exactly the same sentences that it had intended to impose on that date, as the conduct of the matter since that date is simply confirmatory, in the Court's view, of an opinion that had already been formed and taken into account.

118It is, of course, important to also note that Ms Gurung has no previous criminal record.

119For the purposes of sentencing, I have had regard to section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have taken into account, to the extent that it has been requested, the matters relevant to section 21A(2) and subsection (3) of that Act.

120In sentencing an offender, the sentence must reflect the seriousness of the offence, and a sentencing judge must fix a sentence that will ensure that any time an offender must spend in custody reflects all of the circumstances of the offence, including the seriousness and the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence. General deterrence, in the Court's view, is particularly important in relation to an offence of making a false allegation of this nature.

121I am satisfied, pursuant to section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

122I take into account that the offender has little or no support in Australia and that imprisonment in those circumstances will be somewhat more difficult for her than it might otherwise have been.

123It is evident that, the offender now being only present in Australia subject to a Criminal Justice Visa, it is highly likely that she will be deported from Australia when paroled.

124I have considered whether I should find special circumstances. If the offender was an Australian citizen, intending to continue residing in Australia, I would certainly have found special circumstances arising from her age and from the fact that this is the first time that she will have spent serving a period of imprisonment. 

125I have decided that it is not appropriate to distinguish her from someone who is resident in Australia as an Australian citizen, and not likely to be deported, and so I will find special circumstances on the basis that I have indicated, to provide an extended period of rehabilitation, even though it is likely that that must occur when she is in fact removed from Australia and not subject to supervision.

126Accordingly, I will vary the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the additional term in the offender's favour by reducing the nonparole period.

127Ms Gurung, would you please stand.

128You are convicted in relation to each of the two offences.

129You are sentenced in respect of the offence of enter a building with intent to commit an indictable offence, that is, to intentionally damage the property of ST, to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months to date from 8 June 2012 and to expire on 7 September 2012.

130It is a fixed sentence because I intend to make the sentence for the offence of making a false accusation with intent to subject ST to an investigation for an offence of sexually assaulting you to a concurrent term, particularly in the light of what I have previously said about the enter building with intent offence as being at the lower end of any range of seriousness.

131In respect of the false accusation offence, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years with a non-parole period of one year dating from 8 June 2012 and expiring on 7 June 2013. The balance of term, having found special circumstances, is one year commencing on 8 June 2013 and expiring on 7 June 2014.

132I make an order that you be released on parole on 7 June 2013.

133Ms Gurung, since you are inexperienced in respect of sentencing in criminal matters, I should indicate that that means that you will be released from custody on 7 June 2013. Whether you are then deported or not is not a matter for me. You can sit down, thank you.

		28 March 2013",2012-10-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760322,R v WA [2012] NSWSC 1317,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 8 August 2012, WA (to whom I shall usually refer in these remarks as ""the offender"") was arraigned on a count of murder before a jury panel. The indictment alleged that, on 2 August 2009 at Cabramatta West, the offender murdered Slobodan Simic (to whom I shall usually refer as ""the deceased""). The offender pleaded not guilty to murder, and offered no plea with regard to the implicit alternative count of manslaughter. A jury was immediately empanelled, and the trial commenced before me. 

2On the 12th day of the trial, and well into the Crown case, the offender was re-arraigned on the same count. On that occasion, he maintained his plea of not guilty to murder, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. Pursuant to s 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, I found the offender guilty of the offence of manslaughter, and the jury was of course discharged without delivering a verdict. 

3As a result of those events, the offender comes before Court to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter today. 

Approach to findings of fact

4An agreed statement of facts was tendered in the proceedings on sentence that describes the joint position of the parties with regard to the events of 2 August 2009. I also propose to rely upon some parts of the evidence in the trial, none of which contradict the agreed facts. During the proceedings on sentence, I identified for defence counsel the precise areas with regard to which I propose to adopt that course. Defence counsel had no objection to that approach. 

5As for subjective features, these were established by a criminal record, a custodial history, a Juvenile Justice report, a psychological report, a letter addressed to me from the offender, and some oral evidence from the maternal aunt of the offender, Ms Karen McDonald. Again, the Crown Prosecutor did not call into question any of that material to a substantial degree. 

6I approach matters of aggravation that are against the interests of the offender on the basis that, before I may take them into account, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. As for matters in mitigation that are in favour of the offender, I approach them on the basis that they must be established on the balance of probabilities: see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270. Because of the circumstances of the offence that I will outline in a moment, I have also borne the principles enunciated R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 firmly in mind.

Events of 2 August 2009

7On the day of the offence, the offender was aged 16 years 10 months. He lived with his mother, his mother's boyfriend, his younger sister and his elder brother, aged 19 years, at an address in Cabramatta West. The male cousin of the offender, aged 18 years, lived in the suburb of Claymore, and often visited the home at Cabramatta West. 

8That home backed on to a vacant block, which itself looked out onto the intersection of Sulman Road and another street. A gap in the fence at the rear of the home of the offender permitted an easy shortcut, by way of the vacant block, to that intersection. 

9On the evening of Saturday 1 August 2009, a car registered in the name of the offender was parked on that vacant block. At some stage during the evening, it was deliberately set on fire by an unknown person, and destroyed. 

10The following morning, Sunday 2 August 2009, the cousin of the offender and the brother of the offender went to the vacant block and had a conversation with a neighbour about who may have set the fire. The brother of the offender expressed his belief that either the deceased, or an associate of his, was responsible. 

11The deceased, then 37 years of age, was in a relationship with Ms Debra Jones, who lived at an address in Sulman Road. That address was about 200 metres from the home of the offender, as the crow flies. 

12At the time when the cousin and the brother of the offender were in the vicinity of the vacant block, the deceased rode towards them on his pushbike. The brother and the cousin loudly threatened to kill the deceased. As he turned to run away, they threw pieces of brick or rock at him. Those missiles hit the deceased in the head and arm, and drew blood. The deceased returned to the home of Ms Jones and commenced to wash the blood off himself. 

13The cousin and the brother returned to the home of the offender. There they armed themselves with a baseball bat and a large machete. The offender, who I am satisfied was aware that some sort of violent confrontation was going to occur, but was not sure precisely what, armed himself with a firearm. I am not satisfied that that act on the part of the offender was part of any prearranged plan between the offender, his brother, and his cousin.

14The firearm was a loaded semiautomatic .22 calibre rifle that had been shortened with a degree of skill. It had also been fitted with a silencer which, although not professionally manufactured, was nevertheless very well made. In short, the offender left the house with what was effectively a semiautomatic pistol with a functioning silencer and a magazine that contained at least four cartridges. I am not satisfied that the offender loaded the gun himself. However, I am satisfied to the requisite degree that, when he grabbed it, he was aware that it was loaded. 

15The cousin and the brother ran about 100 metres up Sulman Rd towards the home of Ms Jones, where the deceased had remained. The offender remained close to the intersection of Sulman Road and the other street.

16Hearing the yelling of the brother and the cousin, the deceased left the house. He came out on to the street and approached the brother and the cousin. He took off his shirt in order to prepare for a fight. He was unarmed, and yelled at the brother and the cousin that they should drop their weapons and engage in a fist fight. 

17Instead, the brother and the cousin swung the baseball bat and the machete repeatedly at the deceased. The machete did not connect with his body. However, the deceased was struck at least once by the baseball bat. At some point a friend of the deceased entered the scene, himself armed with a machete, in order to help the deceased. He swung the machete and it connected with the baseball bat. 

18The brother and the cousin suffered no injuries as a result of this confrontation. They turned and ran back towards the intersection that I have described. 

19At some imprecise stage of the proceedings (an aspect to which I will return in a moment) the offender, who was still standing many metres away near the intersection, fired four rounds from the firearm. All those rounds were fired in a westerly direction, that is, towards the deceased. Bullets were heard by witnesses to be literally whizzing down the street. One of them lodged in a mailbox many metres from where the offender was standing, and narrowly missed a neighbour who was close to it. At the time the shots were fired, a substantial number of people were at the windows of their homes, on their front porches, in their front gardens, or on the footpath, having been attracted by the sounds of the confrontation. 

20I am satisfied that none of the bullets were fired into the air, but rather that all of them were fired parallel to the ground. I am also satisfied that they were fired in rapid succession. 

21At the time of the discharge of those bullets, the deceased had turned away. One of the projectiles struck him in the back and penetrated his heart. He collapsed in the street outside the home of Ms Jones. Tragically, he died in hospital shortly afterwards as a direct result of the gunshot wound to his back. 

22The agreed facts are a little unclear as to precisely at what stage of the confrontation the offender fired the shots. As for my own findings, it is inconceivable that the offender would have fired when his brother and cousin were standing right next to the deceased. It is also noteworthy that the deceased was shot in the back, which is suggestive that the confrontation had come to an end. On the other hand, I do not find that the spraying of the bullets was undertaken by the offender well after the confrontation had concluded. Although the deceased had turned away at the time he was shot, and although I am satisfied that the brother and the cousin were not in the immediate vicinity of the deceased at that time, I find that the shots were fired either very much towards the end of the confrontation or perhaps just after it had ended. I shall explore the motivation of the offender in doing so later. 

23After the shooting, the offender, his brother and his cousin fled through the vacant lot back to the family home, where they discarded various items. The brother and the cousin ended up in a siege in a home nearby, surrounded by police. They were eventually arrested on the same day. By that time, the offender had escaped the area. 

24On 23 November 2009, the offender was arrested and exercised his right to silence. He has been in custody ever since. 

The objective gravity of the offence

25The maximum penalty of the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period.

26The offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he committed an unlawful and dangerous act that caused the death of the deceased. In light of the plea that the Crown accepted, he is, of course, to be sentenced on the basis that, at the time of the commission of that act, he did not possess one of the three mental elements of murder. 

27In assessing the objective seriousness of this manslaughter by way of unlawful and dangerous act, I bear in mind that, because of the varied factual and legal bases upon which the offence of manslaughter may be committed, it is not easy to create a hierarchical structure of seriousness. 

28Having said that, the undoubted fact is that, on a quiet suburban street at about midday on a Sunday, a number of projectiles were deliberately discharged with the result that a member of the community lost his life. At the time, the lives of other persons were seriously in danger as a result of the actions of the offender. Although I shall speak in more detail about the motivation for the actions of the offender, it can be seen from the facts that I have recounted that the firing of the shots from some distance away was a completely unjustifiable overreaction to the confrontation, itself quite unjustifiable, that took place between the deceased and the brother and the cousin of the offender. 

29A sharp contrast can be drawn with the regrettably not infrequent case of manslaughter in which two young men have a confrontation outside a hotel after closing time, and one of them punches the other once to the head, who falls, hits his head on the footpath, and dies. The objective seriousness of this offence is much greater. 

30Turning to the two bases upon which this manslaughter is made out, it can be seen that the actions of the offender were a grossly unlawful attack on the right of the persons present on Sulman Road that day, including the deceased, to live their lives in peace and safety. Furthermore, firing four bullets that had the self-evident capacity to travel hundreds of metres down a suburban street that was occupied in the ways that I have described was an exceptionally dangerous thing to do. Indeed, the fatal result of the acts of the offender demonstrates precisely that. 

31In short, the objective seriousness of this manslaughter cannot be characterised as anything other than extremely grave. 

Subjective features

32It was agreed in the proceedings on sentence that the offender had offered to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter even before he was committed to this Court, and that it was the Crown who declined to accept that offer until the 12th day of the trial. I was referred to the well-known authority of R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310. Although I queried defence counsel whether or not the offender is entitled to a full utilitarian discount, in light of the fact that he did not plead guilty to manslaughter at the start of the murder trial, on reflection I have decided that the sentence should be discounted to the extent of 25 per cent. In that regard, it is instructive that the offender in R v Oinonen did not enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter at the start of his trial. 

33As for the question of remorse, it is noteworthy that I did not hear from the offender in the witness box. I have borne in mind the note of caution sounded in such decisions as R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369. I also consider that a letter such as the one written to me by the offender may often be of little value, because it is hard to know whether the expressions of remorse contained in such a letter truly derive from the offender. That is especially the case in the absence of cross-examination. It also worth bearing in mind that, for some weeks after the offence, the offender was on the run. When he was arrested, he by no means made a full confession of what he had done, but exercised his right to silence. Finally, in the Juvenile Justice report it is said that ""whilst [the offender] expressed remorse at the consequences of his actions, he appeared to normalise the use of a firearm and level of violence in the current offence."" 

34On the other hand, it seems that the offender was prepared to plead guilty to the offence many months ago. His expressions of remorse are recorded both in the Juvenile Justice report and in the psychological report. The letter has some, albeit limited, probative value. Finally, his aunt gave oral evidence of the day upon which the offender confessed to her what he had done, and she described his remorse. In particular, she said that ""he wishes upon wish that it didn't happen"".

35In short, I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful with regard to the fact that he has criminally taken the life of a fellow human being. Whether his immaturity, a subject to which I shall return, permits him to understand the enormity of what he has done, I am not sure. 

36The offender was born in September 1992. As I have said, that means that on the day of the offence he was aged 16 years and 10 months. He turned 20 last month, having been held in custody for almost 3 years. 

37His mother is Aboriginal, and his father is of Lebanese background. His parents separated when the offender was about two years old, and the offender has rarely seen his father. The offender lived mainly with his mother and members of her family, and grew up in contact with her extended family to a large degree. He moved repeatedly, with attendant disruption to his studies. 

38There is no need for me to detail all of the sorry facts that are described in the two reports. It is sufficient to say that, from a very early age, the offender has been exposed to many forms of abuse of alcohol, illicit drugs, and criminality. Indeed, so extensive was that exposure that, by the time of the offence, the offender regarded a life of crime and the abuse of illicit drugs as essentially normal. I am satisfied that his life has been almost completely bereft of appropriate role models. In particular, his mother has long struggled with a dependency on alcohol.

39In considering his background and the circumstances in which he had lived, and was living, on the date of the offence, the deplorable fact that a 16 year old boy had ready access to a loaded, shortened, silenced semiautomatic weapon speaks for itself. 

40As one might expect, the offender had no success at school, academically or otherwise. He was suspended on a number of occasions as a result of his aggression, and ended up leaving school before he completed Year 10. Having done so, he attended TAFE for a day or two before giving up on that as well. He has never had gainful employment in his life. 

41By the time of the offence, the offender had himself been abusing illicit drugs for some years. Indeed, on the evening before the offence he had ingested heroin, though I do not consider that he was in any way affected by drugs or alcohol at the time of the offence. 

42As at that time, the offender already possessed a not insignificant criminal record. It is noteworthy that, in November 2006, when he was barely aged 14 years, he was charged with committing an aggravated break and enter and inflicting actual bodily harm. As a result of that offence, he was the subject of a control order for four months. His record contains a large number of property offences, including many offences of breaking, entering and stealing, dealt with in the Children's Court and the Youth Drug Court. Nor is his record entirely free of violence, featuring as it does resisting police, escaping police custody, and stalking or intimidation. The offender was on probation at the time of the commission of the offence of manslaughter with regard to at least one offence. 

43Having said that, the criminal record of the offender, although lengthy, does not demonstrate that he has been repeatedly sentenced to detention with no effect. Nor are the convictions for offences suggestive of violence of great seriousness. 

44Finally, with regard to his criminal record, although it shows that the offender has been the subject of one or two very short sentences that were imposed and served during the time whilst he has been in custody, I am prepared to provide him with a full backdate to 23 November 2009.

45Shortly after he went into custody, the offender became a father. Because he is not on good terms with the mother, he has never seen his first born child. One can seriously doubt whether the offender is remotely prepared for the responsibilities of fatherhood. In light of his current circumstances, he has not been able to fulfil them, and will not be able to for some time. Whether the birth of that child will truly be a positive event in the life of the offender, only time will tell. 

46All in all, as at the date upon which the offender came into custody, one would have been entitled to assess his future prospects as very poor. 

The future?

47I detect two rays of hope. The first is that I was impressed by the evidence of his aunt, who appears to be someone who has been able to divorce herself from the criminality that engulfs the rest of the extended family of the offender. On occasions throughout his childhood, he was in her care, and she spoke highly of his behaviour and personality during those periods. She also gave evidence that, when he is released, he will be able to live with her, and she will do everything she can to assist his rehabilitation. I think that she is someone who could have the ability to assist the offender to lead a law-abiding life in the future. 

48The second favourable aspect is that, despite some difficulties settling and dealing with the structured environment of children's detention centres, the offender has progressed very well. He claims to be free of illicit drugs, and I am prepared to accept that on the balance of probabilities. More notably, he has completed Years 10 and 11 of High School and his ambition is to obtain his Higher School Certificate. In light of his previous lack of educational achievement, that is to be applauded. Not only that, he was described by teaching staff as a ""highly motivated student"" and a ""pleasure to teach"". I dare say that, throughout all of his primary and secondary schooling in the community, he was never so described. It is even more impressive in light of the fact that his overall cognitive functioning has been assessed as being in the borderline to low average range. The offender has hopes of training in the future in a trade, perhaps to do with motorcycles, and gaining employment for the first time in his life. 

49In short, it is going to be challenging indeed for the offender to wrench himself away from his upbringing and the ways of living and thinking that are already entrenched in him. As a result of that, his prospects of rehabilitation must be quite guarded. Having said that, I have identified two grounds for careful optimism. 

Aggravating and mitigating features

50I do not propose to recite the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I trust that my findings as to the objective and subjective features of the matter sufficiently demonstrate the aggravating and mitigating features that I have found to be established. In considering the matter, I have referred myself to the section, whilst taking care to avoid the danger of erroneous double-counting.

Comparable sentences

51I have considered a number of decisions of this Court, both in the Court of Criminal Appeal and at first instance, in which the offence of manslaughter has been committed by an offender who was under the age of 18 years at the time. As one would expect, there are few that involve the use of a firearm, not only because it is reasonably rare for a juvenile to use a firearm in our society, but also because many such uses will constitute the more serious form of homicide. I will not recount in these remarks on sentence the details of all of those cases. However, annexed to the formal written judgment will be an appendix which provides a very brief overview of them. 

52I am quite aware that, in comparison to those other decisions, the sentence that I shall impose shortly is a substantial one. But that is the inevitable consequence of the objective seriousness of this offence.

Sentencing a juvenile offender

53Although the offender is being dealt with according to law as a result of his having committed a serious children's indictable offence, the special principles of sentencing contained in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 continue to apply. I have borne those principles steadily in mind, and have taken the approach that they work an important alteration to the usual principles of sentencing that would apply if I were sentencing an adult. 

54I have also considered the common law on the topic, including of course what was said in the decision of R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, along with the judgments in the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128.

55I accept that the commission of the offence, constituting as it did a gross and spontaneous overreaction, was caused at least partly by the immaturity of this 16 year old, combined with the powerfully antisocial upbringing to which he was subjected through no choice or fault of his own. I also accept that the offence was motivated, at least to some degree, by a wrong-headed desire to protect his brother and his cousin.

56Having said that, the repeated firing of what was effectively a semiautomatic pistol down a suburban street could hardly be described as the crime of a child: see KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51. Nor, of course, was the offender aged 13 or 14 years as at the date of the offence. He was almost 17, and had left school some time before. 

57I accept that the rehabilitation of a juvenile offender is to be given great weight. But general deterrence, that is, seeking to dissuade others, whether young or old, from doing what the offender did on that day, must play a significant role in this sentence. Despite the remorse that I have found to exist, and the progress that has been made in custody, so must personal deterrence.

58The sentence reflects the age of the offender, his immaturity, the upbringing to which he was subjected as a child, the different statutory considerations that apply, and the applicable principles at common law. To be clear about it, had the offender not been a child at the time of the offence, the sentence would be substantially longer. 

Parity

59The brother of the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced in this Court. The plea was entered on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise, in that the brother contemplated the possibility that either the cousin or this offender might do an unlawful and dangerous act, but nevertheless remained involved in the confrontation. The brother was aged 19 years at the date of the offence. He pleaded guilty. His criminal record was also not insubstantial, and featured violence in the form of robbery in company. It appears that he had never been the subject of a control order. The brother was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years 3 months, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years. 

60The cousin of the offender also pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was also sentenced in this Court. He did so on the same basis, namely extended joint criminal enterprise with regard to the commission of an unlawful and dangerous act. The cousin was 18 years old as at the date of the offence. The remarks on sentence recount him as having had a lengthy history with Juvenile Justice, including the imposition of a number of control orders. He had been dealt with for various offences, although the remarks on sentence recount the only offence of violence as being common assault. The cousin was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years 6 months. 

61Despite the submission of defence counsel in this matter, it seems to me that any non-parole period imposed on the offender that was shorter than the non-parole periods imposed upon his brother and his cousin would, bearing in mind the brief overview of the objective and subjective features of their matters that I have provided, demonstrate erroneous disparity. I say that whilst taking full account of the age of the offender. The fact is that the brother and the cousin were involved in a violent and unacceptable confrontation with a fellow citizen and foresaw the possibility of something worse happening; in stark contrast, the offender sprayed bullets down a suburban street and took the life of that citizen.

Special circumstances

62Defence counsel submitted that special circumstances are made out, and that it would be appropriate to reduce the length of the non-parole period to some degree. He drew attention to the pressing need that the offender will have for assistance if he is to escape his upbringing, and the aspects of his personality that have been the result. It is also clear that the offender, upon release, will still be a very young man, with his whole life ahead of him. Finally, it is clear that this sentence will constitute the first substantial deprivation of liberty that the offender will have suffered in his life. There will be a very significant process of readjustment when he is released. The Crown Prosecutor did not resist the submission about special circumstances. 

63The submission of defence counsel has a great deal of force. As I have said, the offender has already shown potential whilst in custody, and it is to be hoped that that is the starting point of a new life that will be able to be built upon when he is released. It is also true that, by the time he is released, the offender will have been cut off from the community for a substantial period, and his readjustment will be difficult and challenging. 

64However, the sentence that I shall impose in a moment will feature a time on parole that is not insignificant. Furthermore, I have come to the view that to reduce any further the non-parole period that I propose to impose would not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender, even taking into account all of the subjective aspects, including his age. In that regard, I have considered what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in such cases as Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 and R v West [2011] NSWCCA 91. Of course, I have no intention of achieving a variation of the usual statutory ratio by impermissibly increasing the head sentence that I otherwise consider appropriate.

65Having reflected on the matter, I do not propose to disturb the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

Section 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 

66Both counsel helpfully took me to this important aspect of sentencing the offender, along with the recent decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83. In short, it was agreed by both parties that, if there were to be a non-parole period that could result in the offender not being transferred to an adult correctional centre at any stage, that non-parole period would need to be 4 years 3 months or less, once one considers the date upon which the offender would become 21 years 6 months of age. Defence counsel submitted that such a non-parole period would be open to my discretion, whilst not, of course, submitting that any sentence should be tailored to achieve that result. 

67I respectfully reject the submission of defence counsel with regard to the possible length of the non-parole period. I do not consider that such a non-parole period would appropriately reflect the objective gravity of the crime of the offender, even taking into account his age at the time of the offence, his remorse, the utilitarian discount, and his background. I also consider that any such non-parole period would demonstrate erroneous disparity with regard to the sentences imposed upon his brother and his cousin. 

68It seems to me that s 19(3) is engaged, because the offender is being sentenced to imprisonment with respect to a serious children's indictable offence, and therefore special circumstances would need to be identified for him to be able to serve his sentence as a juvenile offender up until the day he turns 21. 

69Although the offender is well past the age of 18 years, it seems that he has been continuously held in children's detention centres since his arrest. As I understand it, he was not transferred to an adult gaol upon attaining the age of 18 years. In light of that circumstance, combined with the commendable progress that he has made and to which I have referred, I do find for the purpose of s 19(3)(a) that special circumstances are established that justify the detention of the offender as a juvenile offender up until the day he turns 21. I have made that finding on the basis of the need to avoid disruption to the progress that has already been made; the fact that he was not transferred to an adult gaol upon turning 18; the fact that he needs time to prepare himself for the transfer to an adult gaol when he turns 21; and the fact that I believe that it would be unduly harsh for him to be peremptorily transferred to an adult gaol on the same day that I impose sentence. 

70In coming to the finding that there are special circumstances that would permit him to remain in a children's detention centre as a juvenile offender until he attains the age of 21, I have borne in mind the contents of ss 19(4) and 19(4A). In particular, I consider that there would be an unacceptable risk of the offender suffering psychological harm were he to be suddenly transferred to an adult gaol on the same day that he receives a substantial sentence for an offence of manslaughter committed by him when he was a child. 

71To be completely clear, my intention is that he be able to remain in a children's detention centre as a juvenile offender until the day he turns 21, whereupon he is to be transferred to an adult gaol. 

72I make an order, pursuant to ss 19(1) and 19(3), directing that the offender serve his non-parole period as a juvenile offender until the day upon which he attains the age of 21 years. 

Victim impact statement

73A victim impact statement prepared by Mr Milan Simic, the brother of the deceased, was received by the Court. I acknowledge the receipt of that document, and thank Mr Simic for preparing it. That document amply demonstrates the grievous effect that the criminal loss of the life of Mr Slobodan Simic has had upon his extended family. In particular, it has destroyed the wellbeing and happiness of his elderly mother. The thought of a loved one in the prime of life being shot in the back without the slightest justification, and having his life ebb away in a suburban street, will be an exceptionally painful one to bear for those who loved the deceased. And they will bear it for the rest of their lives. On behalf of the Court, I extend my condolences to the family of the deceased for the loss that they have endured, and will continue to endure. Nothing that will occur today can make good that loss, although it may be that the end of these proceedings, more than three years after the events in question, will provide some closure to those who are suffering. I have dealt with the victim impact statement in accordance with well-established principles: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.

Permit publication or broadcast? 

74Finally, I have considered s 15C of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. There has been no application by either party, or any other interested person, for the usual statutory prohibition on the publication or broadcast of the name of the offender to be lifted, on the event of his being convicted today of a serious children's indictable offence.

75Of my own motion, I have considered the factors contained in s 15C(3), but have decided that the section should not be engaged. As a result, it remains the case that it would be an offence for any person to publish or broadcast material that connects the name of the offender with these criminal proceedings.

Imposition of sentence

76WA, you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years to date from 23 November 2009 and expire on 22 November 2015. There will be a parole period of imprisonment for 2 years, to commence on 23 November 2015 and expire on 22 November 2017. 

77Accordingly, the head sentence is imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years. But for your plea of guilty, I indicate that the head sentence would have been imprisonment for 10 years 8 months.

		29 October 2012",2012-10-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760323,R v Youseff [2012] NSWDC 252,"Judgment

1Nada Vanja Youseff stands for sentence as a consequence of adhering to two pleas of guilty entered at the earliest available opportunity in the Local Court. The first charge was that on 8 March 2011 at Kingsgrove she did wound Robin McKivatt in an attempt to cause her grievous bodily harm. That is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. It is a very serious offence. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty-five years. There is a standard non-parole period of seven years. 

2The court attendance notice for the second offence is one of the most poorly drawn documents that I have seen. With the necessary corrections, the charge was that on 8 March 2011 at Kingsgrove the offender did, without consent, detain Robin McKivatt with the intention of obtaining an advantage, to wit a [psychological] gain, the said Robin McKivatt [having had] occasioned actual bodily harm [to her] during and after being detained, while the said [Nada Vanja Youseff] was in the company of Ali Charbaju. That is an offence contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence can be shortly described as specially aggravated kidnapping. Again, it is a most serious offence. Parliament has prescribed a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period has been fixed.

3In addition, the offender asks me to take into account on a Form 1 in connection with the crime of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm an offence of causing another to take an intoxicating substance. That is alleged to have occurred at the same place and on the same date. That again is a crime which carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment.

4The facts of the case are disturbing. The victim, Mrs Robin McKivatt, was at the time of the offences fifty-three years old. At an early age she developed jaundice, which left her with cognitive impairment and a speech impediment. Mrs McKivatt has been diagnosed as suffering from a ""mild intellectual disability"". The adjective ""mild"" is used to differentiate Ms McKivatt's intellectual disability from other forms of intellectual disability. The five grades of intellectual disability are borderline, mild, moderate, severe and profound. To suffer from a mild intellectual disability a patient must have an IQ of between 50 and 69. It must be pointed out that the low average range of IQ is 80 and the average range is between 90 and 109. Whilst the victim's intellectual disability has the technical nomenclature ""mild borderline disability"", Dr Susan Hayes, a Professor of Behavioural Science in Medicine and a forensic psychologist, points out that this is a serious intellectual disability. In the same report concerning the victim, Dr Hayes points out that the victim's son, Jason McKivatt, who was twenty-eight years old as at 26 April 2012, suffers from a learning disability.

5The offender was aware of the victim's intellectual disability. Answer 99 in the electronically recorded record of interview of the offender conducted on 9 March 2011 is this:

""Um, I think she's mentally slow in the head. Um, she cries out for a lot of attention. She want's people feeling sorry for her all the time so she goes around crying all the time, that's why no one takes much notice of her anymore. Other than that I don't know much about her. I don't even know where she lives, I don't know anything about her.""

6However, earlier in the same record of interview the offender admitted that Jason McKivatt had been her gardener ""for a long time"". She pointed out that the victim followed her son ""like a bad smell"", everywhere. She also went on to say a number of pejorative things about the victim. She referred to her as always being drunk and of engaging in sexually inappropriate behaviour with young men. She also made pejorative comments about the victim's personal hygiene, and of her constantly following her son around and often having disagreements with him. The same record of interview suggests that the victim may have been doing work for the offender in her home, essentially as a cleaner, although the evidence concerning that is scant.

7Jason McKivatt's source of income is mowing lawns. On the admission of the offender, he had been mowing her lawns at her premises in Stoney Creek Road, Kingsgrove for a long time. According to the agreed facts it was for almost a period of two years. On 8 March 2011 Mr Jason McKivatt received a telephone call from Ali Charbaju, who would appear to be the same as the Ali Charbaju referred to in the second court attendance notice. That young man is the offender's son. At 8 March 2011 he was under eighteen years of age. Ali asked Jason to attend the Stoney Creek Road premises in order to mow the lawns. Both Jason and his mother, the victim, attended the offender's premises sometime after 1.15pm. When the victim and Jason arrived at the offender's home, they noticed that there was present, in addition to the offender and her son, a number of girls, one of whom they believed was a daughter of the offender. Some time after the victim and her son arrived at the offender's home, the victim entered the house and stayed inside whilst Jason was outside mowing the lawns. The victim was offered wine by the offender and also by a girl whom she believed was called Amanda. All told the victim drank about five glasses of white wine. Both the victim and her son had a meal at the offender's premises. It is not clear when the meal was taken. 

8At some point in the afternoon, Jason left the premises but the victim stayed at the premises because the offender asked the victim to do so. It would appear that the leaving of the premises by Jason was late in the afternoon, indicating that the meal taken may have been an early supper. When Jason McKivatt left he assumed that his mother was following behind him. Only when he was some distance away from the offender's home did he realise that that was not the case. Jason rang his mother's mobile telephone on several occasions but was unable to contact her. I can only assume that the calls went unanswered. 

9At some time after Jason left the offender's home, the victim was dragged into the kitchen and attacked by the offender. The victim was thrown to the ground. She was ""kicked and punched all over"" but was unable to describe her assailants. The use of the plural in the agreed facts clearly points to there being more than one person carrying out the attack whilst the victim was on the ground. As she was being attacked the victim felt pain her ribs, in her left breast and in the region of one of her shoulders. The offender then went to a drawer and obtained a knife. The knife was approximately twenty centimetres in length or, to use terminology with which I am more familiar, about four inches long. It had a serrated blade. The handle was black and was about ten centimetres in length, and therefore the blade itself must have been ten centimetres (or four inches) long. With that knife the offender stabbed the victim ""multiple times"".

10The victim tried to defend herself but suffered injuries to her scalp, her shoulder, her left breast and her arm. The attack then stopped. The victim was picked up and sat on a chair. Her hands were then taped together with duct tape and that tape was put over her mouth.

11As the victim was sitting on the chair so bound, the offender and others threatened her. At some stage the victim began having difficulty breathing and one of the offenders took the duct tape off her mouth. At some point after the duct tape had been removed from her mouth, someone forced two white tablets into the victim's mouth, which she was forced to consume. After consuming those two white tablets the victim felt ""giddy"" and noticed that her vision had become blurred.

12Blood and urine samples, which were taken from the victim after she was hospitalised, indicated that Diazepam was detected within her blood. The other substances detected in the victim's blood were alcohol and codeine, and an anti-inflammatory was detected in the victim's urine. The only conclusion that I can reach is that the Diazepam was the drug that the victim was forced to ingest. It is the ingestion of the Diazepam which is the subject of the crime on the Form 1.

13Considering the offences that might be dealt with on a charge of causing another to take an intoxicating substance, that offence was clearly towards the bottom of the range. Minds differ as to whether forcible ingestion, which has occurred here, or covert ingestion, where the victim is unaware that some drug is being administered to her or to him, is the more significant crime. It is not necessary for me at this time to make any ruling in that regard.

14Sometime after that the victim managed to get the tape off her hands and then she rose to her feet. The offender saw her and pushed her out of the door of the house with the help of other persons whose identity is presently unknown.

15At approximately 9pm the victim ran across the road and went to a house belonging to Mr Hadi Stambouliah. When Mr Stambouliah answered the door he was confronted by the victim, who was crying and screaming loudly. He observed that she was injured and rang the emergency telephone number.

16Mr Stambouliah in a statement said that the victim was almost incomprehensible when she was talking to him, and was just saying things such as ""I'm bleeding from the mouth; I'm scared; they're going to kill me; they took my phone, my keys, my shoes and my car, why did they turn on me? I just want to die, they tied me up."" 

17The victim was taken by ambulance to the St George Hospital and was treated by, amongst others, Dr Mary Langcake. Dr Langcake described the victim's wounds thus:

""Two wounds to the scalp anteriorly and in the middle - the length and depths of which are not described.
Lacerations of the left shoulder posteriorly - one described as three centimetres in length and one described as one centimetre in length.
Four wounds to the left forearm on the inside aspect described as being one centimetre long and one small wound on the outer aspect of the left forearm, the length of which is not given. 
A wound to the left outer aspect of the left breast described as being a one centimetre laceration.""

18Specialist imaging revealed air in the tissues of the left armpit and the left pectoral muscles, and a very small left apical pneumothorax and an undisclosed facture of the nasal bone.

19The small left apical pneumothorax, together with what is described as ""surgical emphysema"", suggested that one wound had penetrated the left chest cavity.

20Dr Langcake was unable to comment with any certainty on which of the wounds was deep enough to have penetrated into the left chest cavity, however free air in the tissues on imaging seemed to indicate a tracking in the direction of the laceration to the victim's left breast.

21Only a penetration of the left breast explains, on the evidence currently before me, the cause of the left sided apical pneumothorax.

22The wounds to the victim's head and eyebrow were sutured under local anaesthetic. They have been described thus:

""Starburst laceration at the hairline of the mid frontal regional 4 x 3 centimetres requiring seven sutures
Four centimetre superficial laceration to the left parietal region which was closed with dermal glue
Between 5 and 6 centimetre anteroposterior laceration in the right parieto-occipital region which was closed with four sutures
A 1.5 centimetre left lateral breast wound closed with three sutures.""

It is that latter wound which seems to have caused the left apical pneumothorax.

23Later on 9 March 2011 the victim underwent surgery under general anaesthetic. There was a washing and suturing of the left shoulder and left arm lacerations. The wound in the left shoulder extended deeply through the attachment of the deltoid muscle and that required suturing. Exploration of the left forearm muscles showed that three upper most wounds had actually pierced into the belly of a muscle although there was no involvement of any tendon. A wound on the lateral aspect of the left forearm did not involve the fascia and therefore could not have penetrated the subdermis.

24As far as the wound to the left breast, which appears to have penetrated into the left chest cavity is concerned, Dr Langcake expressed the view that the wounding to the chest cavity could have been potentially life threatening.

25The police conducted an examination of the offender's home. They found apparent blood on the floor of the dining room and on the southern wall and the eastern wall and on parts of a dining room chair which had been overturned. The inference to be drawn is that that was the chair on which the victim had been sat and to which she had been taped in order to restrain her.

26Police also observed a strong smell of bleach coming from the kitchen sink. Such may have been used to try to rid the kitchen sink of blood and the like. After removing items from the sink, police located at the bottom of the sink two spoons, a knife and numerous strands of hair. The blade of the knife was bent at the hilt and had several red and brown stains as well as several strands of brown hair stuck to it. The hair located in the sink was similar in colour to that located on the floor of the kitchen. The inference to be drawn is that the bent knife was the knife used by the offender in her attack on the victim. The presence of hair is consistent with stabbing of the scalp of the victim.'

27On top of the microwave was located a silver coloured plastic bag within which was a baseball cap, which would appear to have been heavily soaked with what appeared to be blood, with the majority of the inner lining stained red. An inference that could be drawn is that that baseball cap had been worn by someone involved in the assault upon the victim.

28According to the agreed facts, the offender was arrested and at about 4am on 9 March was taken with her son to the Hurstville Police Station. However, I am told that there is some inexactitude as to exactly the time that the offender was arrested. I am asked to backdate any sentence to the 8 March 2011. 

29The offender has been in custody since the time of her arrest. I am told that that is a period of one year, seven months and seventeen days. The offender's son, Ali Charbaju, is to stand trial in this Court on 5 November next.

30The offender has no recollection of her conduct on the evening of 8 March 2011. The victim herself cannot explain it and the motive for the attack upon the victim is completely unknown. However, certain things can clearly be ruled out. The attack could not be described as ""domestic violence"". There is no suggestion that it was some act of vigilantism. There is no suggestion that there was any motive of revenge. I do know that before the attack a cask of white wine was consumed. The victim herself had had about five glasses of white wine. That is consistent with her blood alcohol reading of 0.056.

31I do not know if the only persons taking white wine were the offender and the victim or whether other women may also have been taking wine. I do know, however, that the offender, by her own admission, was also smoking cannabis.

32The smoking of cannabis and the taking of white wine suggest intoxication. Intoxication would explain the lack of recollection by the offender of what occurred on the evening of 8 March 2011. Intoxication might also explain why the offence occurred. When people are drunk they become disinhibited and do many things that, when sober, they would not do.

33Something could have been said which upset the offender, causing her to act in the way she did towards the victim. Equally, disinhibited, the offender may no longer have been able to put up with what she might have considered annoying conduct by the victim.

34The disturbing things, of course, are causing the victim to stay at the offender's home and sending the victim's son away so that the victim would be alone. There is then a frenzied knife attack upon the victim, in which she sought to defend herself. She sustained a large number of lesions and a large number of those lesions are clearly wounds within the meaning of the law.

35The victim was then restrained and her mouth was taped over and her hands taped together and she was made to sit in a chair. This has all the hallmarks of gratuitous violence and, were the authorities to have acted in such a high-handed fashion, one might almost use the word torture.

36I have been provided with diametrically opposed submissions. On behalf of the Crown, Mr Sfinas submits that each of the two principal offences is one towards the top of the range of seriousness. Mr Barber of Counsel, for the offender, submits that each is towards the bottom of the range of seriousness.

37When one considers wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the extent of the injuries is obviously of great moment but not in itself conclusive. Here I have a large number of wounds, in the legal sense, and other lesions. However, fortunately for all concerned, it would appear the victim has made a good physical recovery from her injuries. However, any tribunal of fact can readily accept that any person, whether intellectually disabled or not, would find the experience which the present victim underwent not only horrifying but terrifying.

38The victim, because of her background, has been unable to personally prepare a victim impact statement. A victim impact statement was prepared on her behalf by her sister, Miss Jan Newton. The victim impact statement tells me that the victim suffered both physically and emotionally from her ordeal.

39Apparently the victim struggles to understand why someone would do to her the things which were done to her. The victim asks, ""Is it because I'm different?"" The victim is haunted by bad dreams at times and, at other times, by an inability to sleep and of fears of being kicked across the ground and being laughed at. The victim's sister confirms that the victim was in great physical and emotional pain during her recovery from her physical injuries.

40The last two sentences in the victim impact statement are these:

""When Robin asks me, ""Why?"", I tell her that there is always a reason why people do what they do but there is no excuse.

Robin says, ""Nada was my friend - friends don't do that, do they?"" No they don't!""

Of course, the quote ""No they don't"" are the words of Miss Newton rather than of the victim herself. However, one can understand the victim being absolutely perplexed by her terrifying ordeal, which she thought had been visited upon her by someone she considered ""a friend"". 

41There is nothing that can justify the violence meted out to the victim. In fact, there was no explanation for it at all. One can only try to concoct the reason why the offender was motivated to do what she did. Perhaps she took exception to something that the victim said or did and, disinhibited by alcohol, over-reacted.

42The evidence does not offer any further explanation. Towards the beginning of these reasons I set out what the offender herself said about the victim in her electronically recorded interview on 9 March 2011. Clearly, the offender was there showing some personal animus against the victim which appears to have been played out in the gratuitous violence offered to the victim in the attack upon her by the offender.

43But again, going back to the issue of the extent of the gravity of the wounding with intent, one can appreciate that the victim has been left with terrible memories and fears and doubts following upon the attack against her. While from the physical injuries she appears to have made a full recovery, it is hard to believe that she would completely omit from her memory the terror which she experienced in the attack.

44An offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) can be committed with only one wound being inflicted. Here there were a number of wounds inflicted. The wounds were to ""vital areas"", to the head and chest. They were not, for example, merely to the arms and legs but to areas where there are vital organs including the lungs, heart, major blood vessels and, for example, as far as the attack to the victim's head is concerned, one of the wounds was to her eyebrow and it is fortunate that there was no injury to her eyes. It is also fortunate there was no penetration of the victim's skull by the knife wielded by the offender.

45The evidence is unclear as to the period of time over which these wounds were inflicted. It was after an early supper. It was, clearly, after late afternoon and before 9pm. The offending conduct could have taken place over half an hour, an hour or a couple of hours. The facts do not enable me to determine. However, this was hardly a fleeting attack, an attack that was brief. It appears to have been sustained over some period of time.

46As far as wounding is concerned, I would categorise this case as being in the mid-range of seriousness. I have on purpose omitted the words ""objective seriousness"". It is in the mid-range of seriousness in the sense in which all crimes must be considered.

47As far as the offence contrary to s 86(3) is concerned, the elements of the offence clearly include a detention of someone against his or her will for an advantage. The only advantage pleaded here is a psychological advantage but one might infer that the reason the victim was detained was to visit her with violence, to inflict injuries upon her and, perhaps, to humiliate her.

48Another essential element is that the offender was in company. She was in company with her son. She admits that by her plea, but other evidence suggests that others may also have been present, perhaps two other younger women.

49The final element in the offence under s 86(3) is the infliction of actual bodily harm. Here, the bodily harm inflicted was much greater than actual bodily harm. It was wounding which itself could amount to grievous bodily harm.

50In so far as the injuries sustained by the victim went beyond actual bodily harm, the infliction of the wounds as far as the s 86(3) offence is concerned should be seen as being aggravated pursuant to s 21A(2).

51In any case of kidnapping there are a number of matters to be considered. They include the period of detention, the circumstances of detention, the nature of the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. See, for example, R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130 at [55]. I have already referred in to the period of the detention. Here it may have been for a few hours, it could have been for less. One case with which I dealt the period of detention was seven days. The period of the detention is, in the grand scheme of detention, not particularly long. However, the circumstances of the detention were significant. The detention began as the victim was being dragged into the kitchen. She was then attacked by being kicked and punched all over when she was on the ground. The offender, who was wielding a knife, then attacked her. 

52A large number of knife wounds were inflicted. When that attack had stopped, the victim was picked up, put on a chair and her hands were taped together and her mouth was taped over and then she was made to ingest a drug. After some time she was able to get the tape off her hands, rise to her feet and seek to escape and, in doing so, was pushed out of the door by the offender and others unknown. These were very different circumstances to the circumstances referred to in Ayoub and El Masri v R [2000] NSWCCA 196, where the conditions of detention over seven days were almost polite.

53Again, when I consider the nature of the person being detained, this count's happening to an intellectually disabled adult aged fifty-three must have been extremely frightening, demeaning and insulting. A mature lady of fifty-three ought not be detained in circumstances that University freshers might once have thought appropriate for a hazing ceremony.

54Again, I am required to consider the purpose of the detention, a purpose which only can be subject of conjecture. Here it was at least for the purpose of injuring the victim and perhaps insulting her.

55This offence is at least in the mid-range of seriousness for an offence contrary to s 86(3). There was not only detention but also restraint by having her hands taped together and her mouth covered with duct tape.

56I turn now to consider the offender's personal circumstances. At the time of the offence the offender was fifty-two years old. She is now fifty-four. She is the mother of six. Her children now appear to range between the ages of thirty-five and perhaps twenty or at least nineteen. Her youngest child, her son, Ali, is yet to stand trial for his part in this crime, if he played a part in it.

57The offender is a mother of at least two grandchildren. Her thirty five year old daughter, Belinda, has a teenage son. Belinda suffers from Lupus Erythematosus Type III. Belinda dearly misses the support of her mother because her mother was providing to Belinda and her husband and son assistance, and in particular to her daughter whilst she was undergoing, amongst other things, chemotherapy.

58The offender's second child is a daughter, Amanda, aged thirty who is a mother of a four year old. When the offender is released from custody she proposes to live with Amanda.

59The offender's third daughter, Safa, is twenty-three and single. The offender's eldest son, Haysam, is currently aged twenty-one or maybe a bit older. He was acting as the offender's carer prior to his being taken into custody for driving offences. I have been told, without objection from the Bar table, that he is to be shortly released from custody.

60The offender's two younger sons are Azam and Ali, who are either twenty and nineteen, or twenty-one and twenty. They live together in Miller.

61The offender was born in Croatia and moved with her family to Germany when she was two years old. Her family remained in Germany for nine years before migrating to Australia in 1969 when the offender was eleven years old. Between the ages of eleven and sixteen the offender was sexually abused by her eldest brother. To escape his abuse, the offender married her first husband at the age of sixteen. However, that marriage failed after two years. There have been two subsequent marriages. The second marriage was to a man who was addicted to heroin and he introduced the offender to that drug. The offender's third relationship is referred to as being one marked by domestic violence, which ended after some eighteen years.

62Not only did the offender marry at sixteen, she also left school at sixteen and commenced to train as a hairdresser. She completed her hairdressing course in the early 1970s and worked casually in that industry during the birth of her children. However, according to the pre-sentence report, the offender has not worked for the last ten years and, at the time of the crime now in question, was in receipt of a disability support pension.

63It would appear that the offender has suffered from a depressive illness for many years. One can understand that a young girl who is sexually abused by a close family member for a period of five years from age eleven to age sixteen might develop a depressive illness. It would appear that the offender started receiving treatment for depression in about 2002 after a stillbirth. It was shortly after that stillbirth that the offender broke off her third marriage or third relationship. She then came under the care of a Dr Wisemann, who prescribed antidepressant medication.

64On 16 February 2007 the offender presented to the psychiatric unit at St George Hospital and advised that she was feeling suicidal and had thoughts of taking an overdose. She told the hospital authorities that she had been using cannabis, methylamphetamine and benzodiazepines prior to her admission and that she had had in the past a twelve year history of dependence on heroin with subsequent treatment by methadone. The diagnosis at the time was of depression due to disorders, due to the use of cannabis and due to dependence on other drugs.

65She was admitted to the psychiatric unit from 16 until 19 February 2007. According to a report of Dr Robert Furst of 25 August 2012, during that time the offender displayed symptoms of paranoid delusions but she was not treated with any antipsychotic medication. When discharged from the psychiatric unit, a referral was made to the local SMART recovery drug and alcohol service but there is no evidence that the offender attended at that service.

66It is important to note that prior to that admission not only had the offender been using cannabis but she had also been using methylamphetamine and also abusing prescribed drugs, benzodiazepines.

67The offender admitted to Dr Furst that she had abused cannabis since her twenties. She generally used about one gram per day. She was still using cannabis up until the day of her arrest. Her second husband introduced her to heroin in 1981 and she became dependent upon that drug. She stopped using that drug with the assistance of methadone through the Jacaranda Clinic at the Liverpool Hospital. Dr Furst takes a history of that occurring in 2001 but according to the pre-sentence report it occurred in 2003 and that is the more likely explanation bearing in mind that the offender admitted being heroin-dependent for twelve years.

68In 2009 the offender found it necessary to go back to Croatia. There had been the deaths in her family of her father, an uncle and her grandparents. She went back to Croatia to settle the family estate but there were complications with one of her uncles who made a threat to kill her, producing a handgun in the bedroom of the home in which the offender was staying and demanding the title deeds to the family home.

69The offender returned to Australia on 28 February 2010 under ""a lot of stress"". When she arrived home, her son had gone into custody and that gave her less support at home because her son was acting as her carer. Later on or about that time, the offender's mother died after suffering from dementia.

70One can understand that with a history of childhood sexual abuse, a relationship marred by heroin dependence, another relationship marred by domestic violence, a stillbirth and subsequent treatment for depression, and with the problems arising in 2009 and 2010, the offender should have ongoing problems with a major depressive disorder. That is the diagnosis now provided for the offender's psychological or psychiatric problems. However, such diagnosis does not explain the criminal behaviour in which the offender engaged on 8 March 2011.

71The offender has developed epilepsy. That epilepsy appears to have been of late onset. After recounting the death of the offender's mother, Dr Furst's history continues in this fashion:

""She recalls feeling very depressed, did not sleep well, and smoked a lot of cigarettes. Ms Youseff was also highly anxious about the welfare of her son and the ongoing problems in settling her family's estate. She suffered a number of seizures, as often as daily and then 2-3 times in one day. There were some days without seizures. She recalls having a number of seizures one day in late February 2010 when riding on a bus. There were occasions of tonic-clonic seizures, including one occasion when Ms Youseff lost consciousness and hit her head on the coffee table at home. Other seizures were only partial or absence seizures.""

72The doctor then records that the offender attended St George Hospital for treatment of seizures on 3 December 2010, 4 December 2010, 10 December 2010, 16 January 2011 and 24 January 2011. She was managed with the anti-convulsant medication Keppra. Initially that was 250 milligrams daily. That was subsequently increased to 750 milligrams per day.

73According to Dr Furst's report the offender was under the care of a neurologist at the St George Hospital. When prescribed the Keppra, the offender was taking an antidepressant medication Efexor XR but the Efexor XR and the Keppra did not go well together and that caused the offender to stop taking her antidepressant medication.

74Since her incarceration the offender's depressive illness has been treated by Dothiepin, which has been prescribed for her by Dr Lisa Brown of Justice Health. One can see that since at least 2010 the offender has been suffering with epileptic seizures. An issue has arisen in this case as to whether the offender suffered from an epileptic fit on 8 March 2011. In his report, Dr Furst says this about epilepsy:

""Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterised by the [sic] current unprovoked seizures, during which there is abnormal unregulated electrical discharge that occurs within the brain's cortical grey matter and transiently interrupts brain function. A seizure typically causes altered awareness, abnormal sensations, focal involuntary movements, or convulsions (widespread violent involuntary contraction of the muscles), which is the type often referred to as generalised tonic-clonic seizures.

Although seizures usually only last about 1-2 minutes, there are well described post-ictal (after-seizure) phenomena that have psychiatric relevance, including ongoing altered states of consciousness and awareness, headache, and post-ictal psychosis. About 30-50 percent of all people with epilepsy have psychiatric difficulties, the most common of which are changes in personality, psychosis, violence, and depression. Personality changes seen in epilepsy are most often associated with a heightened experience of emotions, and ""viscosity of personality"", which often manifest as slow, serious, ponderous or pedantic communications, which are often circumstantial. Episodic violence is usually associated with the frontal and temporal lobes. Whether the violence is a manifestation of the seizure itself or of its intra-ictal psycho pathological origin is unclear, however it is uncommon for patients to be violent during the seizure episode.""

75The doctor then goes on to point out that he had been given a history that the offender had a epileptic seizure on the morning of 8 March 2011, and that left the doctor to express the view that the offender was ""probably post-ictal at the time in question"".

76Another thing to bear in mind is the doctor also tells me that the use of cannabis and alcohol can contribute to the frequency and severity of epileptic seizures. The question is, did the offender have an epileptic seizure on the morning of 8 March 2011? I am not so persuaded on the balance of probabilities. It was not mentioned when the offender was interviewed by the police in the early hours of 9 March 2011. It has never been mentioned or, if it were, it has not been reported on by Dr Brown, the psychiatrist at the Silverwater Correctional Centre. It was not mentioned to Teresa Sartor, a probation and parole officer who interviewed the offender on 13 July 2012. The only time it has been mentioned was when the offender was interviewed by Dr Furst on 10 August 2012.

77Furthermore, the offender did herself not give any evidence so that this history, although this one history recorded by Dr Furst is some evidence of the fact, has not been corroborated by any sworn evidence. In the light of the lack of any other reference to it, I cannot be persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the offender did suffer from an epileptic seizure on the morning of 8 March 2011. Even if the offender did suffer from such a seizure, her subsequent behaviour is inconsistent with the types of behaviour referred to by Dr Furst. All I know is that the offender was entertaining the victim and other women, that they were drinking alcohol, that the offender was smoking marihuana and that a meal was taken and that then this attack upon the victim occurred. To suggest that the offender was labouring under the effects of an earlier seizure that day is inconsistent with such voluntary behaviour.

78The thing that is abundantly clear is that the offender has no history of any crimes of violence, either in the past or subsequently. She herself has been the victim of violence but of a sexual violence. She has also been the victim of domestic violence. Her criminal history is short and really of no moment in the current sentencing exercise.

79On 29 July 1985 she was charged with possessing heroin in the ACT. She was given a six month suspended sentence. On 22 November 1985 she committed the offence of low range PCA, with a blood alcohol reading of 0.07. At the same time she committed some other driving offences.

80On 11 March 1986 she was guilty of shoplifting. On 11 August 1986 she was charged with breaking, entering and stealing, for which this Court sitting at Campbelltown eventually placed her on the equivalent of a s 9 bond for a period of three years.

81On 10 September 1986, 27 April 1987 and 10 December 1987 the offender committed crimes of stealing. The largest penalty was of eighty hours community service, which was successfully completed. Otherwise, the offender has no criminal history and it is clear that between 10 December 1987 and 8 March 2011, a period of over thirteen years, the offender had not committed any crime at all.

82There are no earlier crimes of personal violence. Again, it makes the circumstances of this case quite unusual and reinforces in my view, my conclusion, that this offence was largely caused by disinhibition due to intoxication.

83The offender has, since being in custody, being doing well. She has been regularly treated by Dr Lisa Brown, is undergoing psychological counselling, is attending both Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and she is clearly resolved to rehabilitate herself, to wean herself off her drug and alcohol addictions.

84There is in evidence a reference from a correctional officer at Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre which speaks of the offender's co-operation with the prison authorities, her assistance in keeping the wing in which she resides clean and of her willingness to help other offenders cope with life in custody.

85In her report of 4 November 2011, Dr Brown said [if my reading be correct]:

""Being of an older age than most other inmates and not having any significant forensic history previously has made an adjustment to prison life to be particularly difficult. Ms Youseff is a shy and unassertive woman who, at times, has had difficulty protecting herself from other inmates.""

86The doctor then goes on to refer to other pressures under which the offender laboured from outside of the prison environment.

87In his report, Dr Furst said this:

""Ms Youseff is a vulnerable inmate in a correctional centre by virtue of her epilepsy, especially given the frequency of her seizures over recent years. She may be exploited by other inmates and may lack the supervision that would otherwise be available from her family and medical professionals in the community. A custodial sentence is likely to weigh more heavily upon Ms Youseff than the average inmate by virtue of her epilepsy and depression.""

88Those, of course, are different considerations to the ones raised by Dr Brown. However, it appeared clear to me that the offender's psychiatric illness has been bettered controlled since the offender's admission to gaol than it was prior to her committing the offences now in question.

89There is also no suggestion either from Dr Brown or from the offender herself, who gave no evidence, or from any other source, that the offender's epilepsy is not adequately controlled since her incarceration.

90However, I accept that the offender's age and her lack of any significant criminal background would cause her difficulty in being a prison inmate. This is the offender's first experience of custody. I trust it will be her last. The probability is that it will be her last and there are clearly special circumstances to warrant the breaking of the statutory nexus between the head sentence and the non-parole period, which I shall come to in due course.

91What are the prospects of rehabilitation? If the offender maintains her resolve to stay abstinent from cannabis and other drugs and alcohol, it is highly unlikely that there will be any further criminal conduct by her. In her letter to me, which is exhibit 6, the offender says this:

""I am on the right medications and I am a lot better. I have done four courses and achieved certificates. I have been doing Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous regularly and psychology.

When I get out I still will be getting counselling and Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous.""

92Dr Furst thought that the risk of offending in a similar matter was ""probably low"", especially if the offender continued to receive assertive treatment through psychiatric and medical services that he recommended either in custody or in the community. In my view, it is unlikely that this lady, who is now fifty-four years of age, will commit any crime of this nature again. I therefore accept that the prospects of rehabilitation are good and the prospects of recidivism are low.

93An issue arises as to remorse. Remorse is not merely regret. Remorse requires an acceptance of the part played by the offender in the offending conduct and empathy for the victim of the crime. In her letter to me the offender said this:

""I am writing this letter to tell Robin and her family how very sorry I am that she had to go through all of this. I had no idea how bad this was until I saw the brief. There is no excuse for this but I have no explanation for this behaviour. I have never done (anything) like this before.""

That letter is undated and I can only assume it is recent. 

94In the pre-sentence report dated 13 July 2012 the following is stated:

""In an attempt to discuss the facts regarding the offence, Ms Youseff stated she did not recall the offences but remembers sitting around and drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis with the victim prior to the offence. She later recalls being arrested by the police about 2 am and being told details of the offence. Unfortunately Ms Youseff expressed a tendency to reflect on the victim's character rather than accept or take responsibility for the offence.""

95In his report following upon examination on 10 August 2012, Dr Furst says this:

""Ms Youseff is aware that her actions were excessive and she expressed remorse in relation to the commission of the offences. She has not been violent before and was open to psychiatric, psychological and medical treatment to address her offending behaviour.""

96I already pointed out that the offender has not given evidence, so she was not cross-examined about the sincerity of her remorse and whether it was prompted by genuine remorse or by the realisation that the expression or remorse might lead to a reduced sentence. Suffice to say that there appears to have been some belated measure of contrition, which shows that the offender's mental state is heading in the right direction. However, I cannot accept that there was remorse from the beginning. Only with a realisation of the severity of what she had done as the offender expressed true remorse. 

97In many ways the offender's personal circumstances are favourable to her, in particular her attempt to rehabilitate herself, to get off alcohol and drugs, and a growing realisation of the gravity of what she has done. That having been said, however, I still must concentrate on the seriousness of the offences which the offender has committed. As I said, they are in that mid-range of seriousness of crimes of this nature.

98The crimes are serious ones. Not only must the offender be punished for her completely unacceptable and inexcusable and unexplained conduct, but there must be general deterrence for and denunciation of the crimes committed; of restraining, against her will, an intellectually disabled woman of mature years and exposing her to gratuitous, unnecessary violence which had the potential of causing much more serious injuries than were actually inflicted.

99It has been submitted on behalf of the offender that I should make the sentences wholly concurrent, because this was one episode of violence. However, I am unable to accede to that submission. In my view there must be some partial accumulation because not to do so would elide the seriousness of the injuries required for the charge against s 33(1)(a) into the lesser category of actual bodily harm required by s 86(3). 

100I should point out that statistics available from the Judicial Commission tell me that for the offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) there is a sample of 104 cases of which seventy-seven are non-consecutive sentences. The median sentence is five years and the median non-parole period is three years. At the top of the eighty percent range the head sentence is eight years and the non-parole period is five years. For the offence contrary to s 86(3) there is a sample of seventy-three cases and of those fifty-one represent non-consecutive sentences. The median head sentence is four and a half years imprisonment and the median non-parole period is three years. At the top of the eighty percent range the head sentence is nine years and the non-parole period is six years. Those statistics do not differentiate between those who pleaded guilty.

101It must also be borne in mind that offences under each section can vary widely. For example, wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm is the same as inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, and the extent of the harm can vary remarkably. Likewise, the circumstances of any specially aggravated kidnapping can vary significantly. 

102I have come to the view that I should start each of the sentencing exercises before me, with a theoretical head sentence of nine years imprisonment. I reduce that by twenty five percent to account for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty by the offender at the earliest available opportunity. Such is conceded by the Crown in this particular case, and such conduct is of great utility because it stops the victim having to re-live the offence by giving evidence and to allow an intellectually disabled lady to do that causes her great relief. That reduces the head sentence to six years and nine months. Applying the statutory formula, the non-parole period should be five years imprisonment.

103However, clearly there are special circumstances to break the statutory nexus between the head sentence and the non-parole period. I have come to the view that in respect of each offence the non-parole period ought be four years. The sentence for the second offence will commence six months after the sentence for the first offence, to reflect the accumulation. Effectively, that means there will be a non-parole period of four and a half years with a further term of two years and nine months. Is that right? Yes, that is right.

104Nada Vanja Youseff, on the charge that on 8 March 2011 at Kingsgrove in this State you did wound Robin McKivatt with intent to cause grievous bodily harm you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 8 March 2011 and expiring on 7 March 2015. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years and nine months, to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 7 December 2017. The total sentence is therefore six years and nine months, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. I take into account in passing that sentence the matter on the Form 1. 

105On the charge that on 8 March 2011 at Kingsgrove in this State you did, without consent, detain Robin McKivatt with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely psychological gain, and the said Robin McKivatt, having had occasioned to her actual bodily harm during and after being detained, while you, Nada Vanja Youseff, were in company with Ali Charbaju, you are convicted. I sentence to you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years, commencing on 8 September 2011 and expiring on 7 September 2015. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years and nine months, to commence upon the expiration and the non-parole period and expiring on 7 June 2018. The total sentence is therefore six years and nine months, comprising the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2760327,R v Abounader [2012] NSWSC 1312,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The offender, Farres Abounader, has pleaded guilty to riot. This is an offence against s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 for which there is a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
2On 22 March 2009 he was involved a violent brawl between members of rival motorcycle gangs, the Comancheros and the Hells Angels, in the departure hall of Terminal 3 at Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport. The clash left one man, Anthony Zervas, dead and 14 others have since been sentenced for various offences arising out of the events. Some of the participants were not actually members of either gang but were either nominee members or associates of members. However, for convenience, I will refer to people as being a member of one or the other. 3The offender was arrested on 3 July 2009 and charged with riot. He was refused bail, and subsequently charged with murder on 12 August 2009. He pleaded not guilty to both offences and was committed to stand trial. 
4The trial commenced with empanelment of the jury on 24 May 2011. There were seven accused. The jury retired on 29 September 2011 and returned its verdicts on 2 November 2011. The offender was acquitted of murder and the jury were unable to agree on a verdict on the alternative charge of manslaughter. No verdict was taken on the further alternative charge of riot.
5On 2 December 2011 the offender appeared before the criminal list judge when a indictment alleging simply manslaughter was presented.  He was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty.  The matter was listed for trial on 3 September 2012.  On 8 March 2012 he applied for bail which was granted, subject to certain conditions.  He entered that bail on 4 May 2012 and was then released. 
6On 24 August 2012 the offender was arraigned upon an indictment that now alleged simply riot and he entered a plea of guilty; the Crown had resolved to take no further proceedings in respect of the charge of manslaughter. 
Facts
7I have received a set of agreed facts as to what occurred at the airport on 22 March 2009 and the offender's role in it. What I am about to say about the offence is largely drawn from the agreed facts but it is supplemented by some references to the evidence in the trial and some factual findings I have made based upon it.  These are confined to matters that, whilst not adverse to the offender, provide additional clarity and context.
8It is included in the agreed facts, and it was common ground at the trial, that there was ongoing hostility between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels and the offender was aware of this.
9The Comancheros were headed by a national president, Mahmoud Hawi, who had absolute power. It was a club which had a hierarchical structure, underpinned by strict and enforceable rules. These rules governed the behaviour expected from members and reinforced a strong culture of loyalty of members towards one another and to the club. Such rules included that any display of cowardice would not be tolerated. 
10At the time of the offence the offender held the office of ""road captain"" within the Comancheros. It is stated in the agreed facts that his duties in this position ""included organising road trips"".  The use of the word ""included"" implies there were other duties as well but the nature of them is not disclosed.
11On Sunday, 22 March 2009 Hawi, along with Christian Menzies, Ishmail Eken, Pomare Pirini and Maher Aouli, all members of the Comancheros, were flying from Melbourne to Sydney on Qantas flight 430. They departed Melbourne at about midday and were due to arrive in Sydney at about 1.30pm. 
12Derek Wainohu, the president of the Hells Angels, happened to be on the same flight and was seen by the Comanchero members. Passengers observed them to exhibit animosity towards him. Hawi glared and gestured as he walked up and down the plane past Wainohu a number of times. He directed Aouli to contact other members in Sydney, including the offender, in order to have them attend the airport. Wainohu sent text messages to members of his gang for the same purpose.
13Telephone records show that after he was telephoned by Aouli, the offender contacted eight other Comanchero members. He then drove his car to the airport with Tiago Costa and Francesco La Rosa as passengers. Another Comanchero member, SP, drove Usama Potrus' mother's car with Potrus, AL and Zoran Kisacanin as passengers. (Publication of the names of SP and AL has been suppressed.) The two cars with their seven occupants first proceeded to a meeting with senior club members (the Commander and the Sergeant at Arms) at Brighton-le-Sands before going to the airport.
14The seven Comancheros who came to the airport did so under the obvious impression that their attendance was required as a matter of urgency. On arrival the cars were parked illegally directly outside the lower, baggage claim, level. All the occupants alighted and entered the building. They immediately went via escalators at the eastern end of the terminal to the upper, departure hall, level where they walked in front of the check-in counters towards the security checkpoint at the western end.
15With the exception of the offender, the Comancheros passed through the security screening area at the western end of the terminal and proceeded to Gate 5 where QF430 was due. The offender was seen on security camera footage signalling to the other Comanchero members and tapping his pocket. Potrus returned to wait with the offender outside the security screening area in the departure hall. The offender did not go through the screening area as he had a knife with him and believed that it would be detected by the walk-through metal detectors.
16Seven Hells Angels members or associates also came to the airport: Peter and Anthony Zervas, Musa Ovalle, David Padovan, Tom Baker, Peter Martin and Elias Khoury. Baker and Padovan went through to Gate 5 via the security screening point in the centre of the terminal. The remaining five men waited in the departure hall.
The Affray at Gate 5
17An affray occurred in the immediate vicinity of Gate 5. Neither Potrus nor the offender were present and it is unnecessary to go into great detail. Suffice to say, there was a verbal confrontation between Hawi and Wainohu after they had disembarked. Wainohu and Baker were punched to the ground and Comanchero members were punching and kicking Padovan. At the end of the affray, Hawi yelled threats to the retreating Hells Angels. None of the participants received serious injuries but members of the public were put in fear.
18The Comanchero members (those who had disembarked from the flight and those who had driven to the airport and gone through to Gate 5) walked as a group out of the sterile area and emerged into western end of the departure hall through a set of 'one-way' bi-fold doors.
19On their way out of the sterile area Aouli is visible on security camera footage making a mobile telephone call.  Telephone records established that it was a call made to Potrus.  Aouli informed him of the affray that had just occurred at Gate 5. It is agreed that news of the affray was passed on by Potrus to the offender.
The confrontation in the departure hall
20The offender and Potrus joined the other Comanchero members as they emerged into the departure hall. The offender and Potrus had been waiting in an area near the security screening point at the top of the escalators that led downstairs to the baggage collection area and exit. But instead of going downstairs to collect their checked baggage, the group of now 12 Comancheros moved quickly towards the five Hells Angels who were milling about in the centre aisle of the departure hall between the business class and economy class check-in counters.
21There was an issue in the trial as to why the Comancheros walked in this direction. Were they aware of the presence of the Hells Angels? Were they intent on confronting them? It was contended on behalf of the Comancheros that they were simply heading towards the escalators at the eastern end of the terminal that had been used earlier by the seven who had come to the airport in order to go downstairs to the cars and leave the airport. I indicated when sentencing Eken and Potrus that this claim had no credibility.  If they were in a hurry to get out of the terminal as they claimed, why would they walk towards some escalators that were at the opposite end of the terminal, about 140 metres away, when there were escalators almost immediately adjacent to the bi-fold doors?  I observed that it seemed highly likely that the Comancheros walked deliberately towards the waiting Hells Angels; probably because Abounader and Potrus had become aware of their presence while they were waiting for the others to return from Gate 5: R v Eken; R v Potrus [2012] NSWSC 2 at [21]-[22]. However, I also indicated that it was unnecessary to decide this issue and that what really was of significance was what occurred when the two groups came together.
22If the Comancheros were not previously aware of the presence of the Hells Angels, they obviously became aware of them as they walked increasingly quickly in their direction. The distance from where the other Comancheros met up with the offender and Potrus outside the bi-fold doors to check-in counters 13 and 14 where they confronted the Hells Angels was approximately 73 metres.
23It is an agreed fact that it was the intention of the Comancheros as they approached the Hells Angels to confront them.  Kisacanin peeled off and ran between the check-in counters, and then continued running east in an apparent attempt to approach the Hells Angels from a different angle; something of a flanking manoeuvre.
24The two groups came together behind the check-in counters.  There was a short verbal argument between Hawi and Peter Zervas before the riot commenced.  The deceased Anthony Zervas made a pre-emptive strike at Hawi with a pair of scissors, striking him near the ear. It was later determined that the deceased had a high level of illicit drugs in his system. Eyewitnesses describe the riot as then breaking out with both sides fighting each other and punches flying everywhere.
The riot moves in front of the check-in counters
25As the riot continued, the participants fought their way through the counters to the area at the front of the terminal where passengers were queuing with their luggage. 
26The fighting that took place, although short-lived, was shockingly vicious. Eyewitnesses described the riot as being a ""massive brawl"", and an ""all in brawl"" between two sides, with more men on one side than the other. One witness spoke of ""an explosion of fighting"".
27Another witness said, ""They all started fighting as well and it was like a frenzy, they just went for it, the whole lot of them, and, you know, punching, throwing - just punching, kicking and then the bollards became involved ... It was just too horrendous"". A witness lining up at the check-in counters fell to the ground as her companion tried to pull her out of the way of the violence. She described the fighting as ""chaotic and quite wild and uncontrolled"", and that the men were ""raging, really angry. There was a lot of momentum, there was no - it would have been quite a hard fight to stop"". 
28The fighting generally involved wrestling, punching and kicking. However, some of the participants picked up bollards to use as weapons. A witness said that he ""saw the metal bollards being thrown through the air and smashed on to people"". A Qantas staff member said that the fighting men ""fell into the crowd; people went flying, screaming; and the bollards were flying"".
29The deceased was pursued to the glass wall at the front of the terminal where he went to the ground. He was bludgeoned with a bollard causing severe head injuries and also suffered three stab wounds to his chest and abdomen. It was an agreed fact in these proceedings that the stab wounds were likely inflicted by a pair of scissors. The Crown has accepted that the offender was at no stage involved in the attack on the deceased.
30The riot lasted only about a minute. However it was extremely frightening and distressing for those present in the terminal. Many of the witnesses felt threatened and terrified. A mother travelling with two young children described being terrified.  She said, ""I was absolutely frozen with fear, and I just held my child close for protection.  I pulled the pram towards me and I prayed that one of those bollards didn't fly through the air and land on my child... my child was crying"". This witness was observed to be ""really distressed, yelling, crying"" and was given oxygen by paramedics.
31Her husband described her as being ""really distressed, yelling, crying"". Another witness said that the mother was ""clearly ... very distressed and looked quite shocked and she burst into tears"" . This witness added, ""I suppose I became distressed myself"". An elderly woman said that she had to turn away as she ""got too distressed because [she had] never experienced anything like this"". An elderly couple seated close to where the fatal assault took place was observed to have been in distress. One of the first police officers on the scene said that a number of the members of the public who were present ""appeared distressed and upset"".
The role of the offender
32The offender was part of the group of Comancheros that was moving quickly towards the Hells Angels in the departure hall. At this time he had formed a clear intention to confront the Hells Angels.
33The offender participated in the fighting as it moved through the check-in counters. He was described by a witness as trying to put another man in a headlock.  She said, ""He was just trying to put this smaller gentleman in a headlock and trying to grab him"".
34At one stage the offender attempted to take out the knife he had in his pocket but he accidentally cut his own hand, causing it to bleed extensively. He was not seen to brandish or threaten anyone with the knife.
35The offender fled the terminal with SP, Costa and Potrus by running along the road to the carpark and taking the lift to the ground level where he and SP had parked the cars. A trail of his blood was found in the carpark and the lift.
36A knife that was similar to the description of the offender's was later found in a drain outside the terminal.
Objective seriousness
37I do not believe that the riot was planned or premeditated. Rather it was the result of three significant factors culminating on the day: the Comancheros' culture that prized loyalty and eschewed cowardice; the ongoing war with the Hells Angels; and the chance encounter between Hawi and Wainohu on flight QF430 from Melbourne. 
38The first response of both sides to this chance meeting was to summon reinforcements to Sydney airport. This may not have been done with the specific intention that there would be a violent confrontation, but the number of Comancheros that were summoned and the urgency with which they arrived indicated that they were alive to that possibility.
39That being said, once in the terminal, I am satisfied that it was the Comancheros who were the principal aggressors between the two groups. They were prepared to engage in violence at Gate 5 with their obvious advantage in numbers of 10 to 3 and they were prepared to continue with violence at an escalated level in the departure hall, where they initially outnumbered the Hells Angels 12 to 5 (Wainohu, Baker and Padovan arrived in the departure hall after the riot had started). 
40Anthony Zervas' attack on Hawi was certainly foolish; Hawi was 178 cm tall with a heavy muscular build while Mr Zervas was 161 cm tall and weighed only 58 kg. But while that attack probably fuelled the aggression of at least some of the Comancheros, I am not persuaded that the riot was initiated by this attack. The fact is that violence was inevitable as the 12 Comancheros hurried towards the 5 Hells Angels with the intention of confronting them. Anthony Zervas simply tried to make a pre-emptive strike.
41A matter that is particularly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the riot is the location in which it occurred. Despite being surrounded by members of public, and airline, airport and security staff, the participants were prepared to engage in vicious fighting across a wide area of the departure hall. The level of violence increased as bollards were picked up and used as weapons. 
42An airport terminal is a place where people are entitled to expect safety and security. But many witnesses were left distressed and fearful by the the riot. There were elderly people and small children present. I have no doubt that the memory of it will live long in their minds.
43In assessing the seriousness of the offence, I also have had regard to the offender's individual culpability for the violence of that day. It is an agreed fact that the offender did not take part in the attack on the deceased and I have excluded from my consideration any responsibility of the offender for the death of Mr Zervas.
44Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the offender did play an organisational role in the violence that occurred that day. After he received the call for reinforcements from Aouli on the flight, he marshalled the other Commancheros before they all headed to the airport. He also stoppped to consult other Comanchero office bearers on the way.
45Further, the offender was armed with a knife. His decision not to pass through the security screening with the rest of the Comancheros and remain in the departure hall indicates that he was well aware that he was carrying a weapon and unwilling to part with it. Once the riot started he tried to pull out the knife.  It was an agreed fact that he cut his hand on it and there were no witnesses who saw him brandish the knife or threaten anyone with it. But it remains that he did go for his knife and I can only infer that this was because he intended to use it during the riot.
46A witness identified the offender fighting during the riot. He was described as trying to put another man in a headlock. His use of violence at least included physical fighting in this respect and it is an agreed fact that the offender was involved in the riot as it came through the check-in counters. 
47I am satisfied that the riot, and the offender's role in it, means that his offence is one of considerable objective seriousness.
Subjective features
48The offender was born in Lebanon in 1981.  He was aged 27 at the time of the offence and is now 31.
49He has a criminal history but it is confined to a court appearance in 2002 when he was fined for two traffic offences had a charge of possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit dismissed without conviction.  As such the record is of no present significance. 
50Evidence as to the offender's personal circumstances comprises a Pre-Sentence Report, a report by Mr Terry Smith, psychologist, and various testimonials.  The offender did not give evidence himself.
51His family came to Australia in 1990 in order to escape the civil war in his home country. His upbringing was unremarkable. The Probation and Parole Officer reported that he enjoys close relationships with family members and has their support.  They appear to have been distressed over his involvement in the incident at the airport. 
52The offender was married in his early twenties but the relationship was disharmonious and they separated prior to him going into custody.  He is now in a relationship formed in the past few months.  There appear to be positive signs for the future of this union. His partner told the Probation and Parole Officer that she is a positive influence on his life and does not tolerate anti-social behaviour or associations.
53The offender was educated to School Certificate level.  A subsequent enrolment in an Information Technology course at a TAFE college was aborted after a short period.  He was subsequently employed in the security industry and in concreting work.  He has suffered back injuries as a result of the latter.  At the moment he is in receipt of government welfare payments. 54The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that he joined the Comancheros in 2007.  He remains a member, but has had no contact with fellow members because of the need to comply with bail conditions prohibiting such contact. 55In relation to the offence, he told the Probation and Parole Officer that he was ""at the airport to pick up an associate and denied any malicious intent"".  It is said that ""he described himself as 'very remorseful' and demonstrated insight into the effect of the offence on the victim, the victim's family and the witnesses and bystanders"".  He also described his time on remand as ""a wake up to himself and his actions"". 56In her summary, the officer reports that the offender's parents maintain his innocence.  I assume from this that he has not told them that he is in fact guilty of playing a role in the riot in the manner described in the statement of facts to which he has agreed. 57Four testimonials were tendered.  A friend described him as being ""of high character and a well-mannered individual"".  A general practitioner who knows the family well described him as hard working, well-connected with his family, not violent, easy going and usually friendly.  
58His mother says she is upset and heartbroken that her son became involved in the wrong crowd.  He has told her that he was ""sorry it happened and that it was a silly mistake in his life"".  He has told her many times that he ""felt sorry for the family particularly Anthony Zervas' mother, who has lost her son"". She feels that after his time on remand he has changed ""dramatically"".  She confirms that the family remains supportive of him.
59His present partner considers him to be ""a very good hearted and honest person who shows remorse for what has happened"".  He has told her that ""he feels very sorry that it happened and that a mother should never have to go through losing a son"". She considers that he has undergone a ""big change in personality since his release from prison"".  Her observations confirm the support he has from his family. The couple plan to become engaged and start a family and ""put this all behind us"".
60The psychologist, Mr Smith, had two consultations with the offender in the past few weeks. He had been briefed with a number of documents including the statement of agreed facts. 
61In addition to matters I have already referred to, Mr Smith reported that the offender had no problems in terms of alcohol or drugs. He had enjoyed a love of motor cycles since childhood. He met some Comancheros through his ex-wife. He socialised with club members without any interest of joining until he did join in late 2007. 
62The offender likened the loyalty inherent in being a Comanchero member to that of any member of a sporting team ""who will support their peers at all costs"".  I doubt that this is quite the characteristic of all members of sporting teams.  The offender described membership of the Comancheros, in effect, as not requiring a person to be involved in anything they did not wish to be involved in; ""no one was compelled to do anything against their will"". 
63As to the events of 22 March 2009, he told Mr Smith that he received a phone call ""from a peer on the plane who requested he meet them at the airport 'in case of trouble ... just be there to pick us up'. ...  [H]e was not informed that the potential difficulties involved another motor cycle group"".  What sort of ""trouble"" his peers might have experienced at the airport is not explained.  How seven men in two cars were going to pick them up was not explained either.
64He explained his possession of a knife by telling Mr Smith that he generally carried one, and other tools, ""for running repairs to the bike and he did not decide on this day to carry one as a weapon"".  I find that explanation to be quite ludicrous.  But whether he deliberately armed himself with a weapon in anticipation of ""trouble"" at the airport, or whether he was generally in the habit of carrying it I am unable to determine.
65Mr Smith uncritically reported that the offender told him that ""he was not aware of the first altercation between the two groups"".  That is contrary to the statement of agreed facts; a copy of which was provided to Mr Smith.  The balance of the offender's account to Mr Smith of the riot is of dubious credibility as well; and contrary to the agreed facts.  For example, Mr Smith reports that the offender said ""he was confronted and overwhelmed by a much larger person and grappled with him"". Mr Abounader had indicated by his signature on the statement of agreed facts that he had no dispute with the description of a witness that he tried to grab and place in a headlock a ""smaller gentleman"". 
66The history obtained by Mr Smith confirms that the offender derives from a loving and supportive family environment.  His upbringing was a happy and uneventful one.  He had no problems at school.  He is described as being reasonably intelligent and with some sporting prowess.  He also appears to be somewhat gregarious.  67Mr Smith asked the offender whether ""he would like to make any further comments to the Court"".  There follows a quotation of what was obviously intended to be a claim of remorse.  Without the offender having been prepared to back it up by giving me an opportunity to assess whether he was genuine, I am not prepared to accept it.  This is particularly so given that it contains assertions inconsistent with the agreed facts:  for example, ""I was just told to be there in case there was trouble and then to walk with them"".  It was an agreed fact that he was aware of the Gate 5 affray and that as the Comancheros approached the Hells Angels in the departure hall he intended to confront them.
68Despite Mr Smith remarking upon the absence of any drug, alcohol and mental health issues, a positive and supportive family environment, above average intellectual capacity, emotional confidence and adequacy, insight and capacity to converse across a range of social, political, religious and philosophical topics, and no psychological or relationship issues, he found the prognosis of him reoffending ""a difficult one upon which to speculate"".
69The report then lists a variety of factors relevant to such prognosis, mostly positive, but then does not express any conclusion. Perhaps that was an oversight because I have the impression from the general tenor of the report that Mr Smith would tend to think that the prospects of re-offending are minimal. However, the fact that he recorded a history without any comment on matters that conflicted with the agreed facts means that such an impression must be considered with circumspection.
Some specific mitigating factors 
70I am not satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  He has made a number of statements to others indicative of remorse, but the evidence does not permit me to conclude in his favour that such expressions are genuine as opposed to self-serving.
71Aside from the offender being an office holder of an outlaw motorcycle gang, I am prepared to accept that he was of prior good character.  His record of previous convictions is trivial.
72Prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending appear to be reasonable.  His current relationship is a positive indicator, although it is early days.  He has a history of employment.  His family support is important.  He has not, however, to my knowledge renounced his membership of the Comancheros.  He has simply avoided contact with fellow members whilst he has been on bail because contact has been prohibited by a bail condition.  It was submitted that his preparedness to accept a parole condition suggested by the Crown today that he continue to have no association with Comanchero members was confirmation of good rehabilitation prospects.  I am more of the view that it would favour a positive finding on this subject if he was prepared to avoid contact of his own volition and not because of being ordered to do so.
73The plea to riot came shortly before the retrial was due to commence.
74It is part of the agreed facts that ""counsel for the offender sought advice from the Crown Prosecutor before the jury were empanelled [at the first trial] as to whether there was any point in making an offer to plead to manslaughter and was advised that it was likely that the Director would not accept such an offer.  No such offer was made formally in writing"".  Whether the offender would have been prepared to plead guilty to anything will remain unknown; the question was not further explored after the Crown's response.  
75A file note of the offender's solicitor was tendered this morning confirming that on 10 May 2011, counsel ""formally made [an] offer to the Crown for [the offender] to plead to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment"" but that the offer was refused.  Whilst I accept that such an offer was made, it was made much later than similar offers were made by other offenders for whom I allowed a reduction of sentence of 20 per cent. 
76It was submitted that I should assess the utilitarian value of the offender's plea with regard to the circumstances of the trial that was thereby avoided.  It would not have been a short trial by any means; the logistics of organising witnesses; and the disruption that would be caused at the airport by the likely need to take the jury on a view were relevant features.
77In all the circumstances I have concluded that there should be a reduction of the sentence to be imposed in the order of 15 per cent. 
78It was submitted that I should take into account the fact that the offender has been on bail for the past almost six months.  The conditions of that bail have been quite strict.  He has been required to report to police on a daily basis and to not associate with any member or nominee member of the Comancheros. I have taken this into account, although I must say it is not a matter of great weight.
79Further, it was submitted that I should take into account delay; the offender has had this matter ""hanging over his head"" for the past three and a half years.  Being left in such a state of uncertainty as to his future is something to consider.  It is something that was relevant in the sentencing of other offenders, although there has been a longer delay in the present case.  It is a matter I will take into account in dealing with the next topic of parity.
Parity 
80 I have borne in mind the sentences imposed upon the various offenders convicted for offences other than riot.  It is important to retain some proportionality but they are of limited significance.
81More significant are the sentences imposed upon others who have been sentenced for the offence of riot:  see R v Eken; R v Potrus, supra, and R v Kisacanin [2012] NSWSC 91.
82The starting point for the sentences imposed upon Eken and Potrus was 6 years 3 months and for Kisacanin it was 6 years. I have carefully reviewed the findings that I made in terms of the objective seriousness of their offences and their own personal circumstances and mitigating features.  I have concluded that the seriousness of the offence in the present case is worse because (a) he was one of the organisers in mobilising the Comancheros to go to the airport; (b) he came armed with a knife; and (c) his culpability in terms of involvement in the fighting was greater in that at one point he had an opponent in a headlock and at another he intended to produce his knife. The subjective features, on balance, are not greatly different. 
83The ultimate submission by Mr Trevallion on behalf of the offender was that I should consider a sentence that, if it exceeded that imposed upon the others sentenced for riot, it would do so only marginally.  If that submission was to be accepted, it was also submitted that I should give consideration to whether there was any utility in returning the offender to prison for such a relatively short period of time.  I have considered this submission.
Special circumstances
84It was submitted on the offender's behalf that there are special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period.  Those circumstances were identified as being the need to promote the continued rehabilitation of the  offender and because it was his first time in custody.  It was also submitted that parity considerations should also influence the assessment of the length of the non-parole period.  The submission was not opposed by the Crown.
85I accept that there should be some reduction of the non-parole period.  A longer period on parole will serve to ensure the commitment of the offender to adopting a prosocial and lawabiding life in the community.  A key element of this would be the avoidance of association with members of the Comancheros, a matter I imagine would be of concern to the Parole Authority.  The extent to which I am prepared to reduce the non-parole period is, however, limited because there remains a need for it to bear an appropriate relationship to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
Pre Sentence Custody
86The offender has been in custody from 3 July 2009 until 4 May 2012.  It is appropriate to take this into account by backdating the sentence to 24 December 2009.
A commendation
87Before imposing sentence there is something further I wish to say.  It is appropriate that I say this now as this is the final offender to be dealt with.
88The incident at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009 was quite without precedent in terms of it being an episode of extreme violence in a completely unexpected environment.  One person died and 15 people have been prosecuted, 14 to conviction.  The code of silence of outlaw motorcycle gangs is a matter of notoriety. Whilst it is impossible for a judge to know the intricacies of a police investigation, it is clear to me that this must have been one of enormous difficulty.  
89The sheer numbers of potential witnesses to be identified and interviewed, and the undoubted reluctance of many to become involved by making statements and giving evidence, are simply examples of those difficulties.  It may not have been apparent to the jury, because attempts were made to conceal it for fear of prejudicing the accused, but all of the civilian witnesses were identified prior to trial only by number and not by name. To my knowledge, it is unprecedented that the identity of so many witnesses was withheld from even the defence lawyers.  That is the measure of the fear which was held for the witnesses' sensitivities and safety. Placating them and fortifying them to give evidence at the trial must have been quite an exercise.
90The people of New South Wales should be thankful that they are served by police officers who have engaged in such a difficult task with such professionalism and dedication.  They should be commended for their work. 
Sentence 
91Convicted 92Sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years.  The sentence is to date from 24 December 2009.  The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 23 December 2013. The total term of the sentence will expire on 23 December 2015. 93That is a total sentence of 6 years.  Without the offender's plea of guilty, it would have been one of 7 years.

2760328,R v Chong [2012] NSWSC 1309,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  On Sunday 17 May 2009 Jong Hwa Park was brutally murdered within a scrap metal factory at Wetherill Park.  He and the offender, Do Hyun Chong, worked together at the factory and shared a bedroom on the mezzanine level.
2The killing came to light when at about 4.30pm that day Mr Chong rang triple zero and reported that somebody was dead.  He informed the operator, ""Come down here.  Everything broken.  The guy down there bloods everywhere ... lay down there near factory.  Please quick, quick.""  He then flagged down some passing motorists, telling them, ""I think there's a dead man inside the factory"". 
3Earlier that day Mr Chong had spoken by telephone with his wife who was in Perth.  He told her that he was not working that day.  There was some suggestion of him going to church.  Later in the afternoon he called her again and, on her account, said that he later arrived at the factory and found the shutter door ""was a little bit ajar and so I went inside, then I found the computer had been smashed and there was a bit of money lying on the floor and that man had been injured, seems to me that he's dead"".
4Uniformed police and ambulance officers arrived and it was readily determined that Mr Park was deceased.  A crime scene and general police investigation commenced.
5Mr Chong made a statement to police that night.  He subsequently engaged in what is referred to as a ""walk-through interview"" the following day.  Police then carried out extensive investigations in relation to the version of events provided by Mr Chong and further interviewed him over 17 hours on 8 and 9 July 2009.  He was informed by the detectives at the conclusion of that interview that they would consider what he had said and would be in contact with him.  
6The overall effect of what Mr Chong told the police was that he had left the factory in the morning and had been to various places in the Strathfield area.  He discovered the body of the deceased soon after arriving back at the factory late in the afternoon.
7It is abundantly clear that Mr Chong was the prime suspect in the mind of the police by that stage.  His account of his movements on the day of the murder had varied considerably, particularly after he was confronted with objective evidence which showed that what he had previously said was incorrect.  
8Four days later, that is on 13 July 2009, a vehicle which was being driven by Mr Chong crossed to the incorrect side of the road on Horsley Drive at Smithfield and collided with a large oncoming truck.  There was no evidence as to why that occurred.  The Crown did not suggest it was a suicide attempt.  It resulted, however, in Mr Chong being hospitalised for a considerable period of time.  He suffered a variety of serious injuries which included catastrophic brain damage.  I will have more to say about that later.
Cause of death
9An autopsy examination of the deceased was carried out on 19 May 2009.  It was determined that the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.  It is unnecessary to delve into the detail of the injuries that the deceased sustained; suffice to say they included numerous serious injuries to the head, chest and abdomen.  The forensic pathologist likened the injuries to those seen in cases of motor vehicle collisions or in falls from height.
10A heavy metal stake was found near to the body on the floor of the factory.  It was blood stained.  DNA material was recovered and a forensic biologist determined that the DNA profiles matched those of both the deceased and Mr Chong.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Park's death was occasioned by a savage, brutal and sustained beating by Mr Chong with the use of that heavy metal stake.  
The crime scene
11The ground floor of the factory had an area of about 13 x 21 metres.  In one corner there was an area set aside with partitioning for use as an office and a bathroom.  A small mezzanine area served as a bedroom for the deceased and Mr Chong.
12The evidence of the crime scene examiner and photographs that were admitted into evidence make it clear that the assault commenced in the office, probably as Mr Park was sitting at a desk in front of a computer.  The body was found well within the factory area but there was no trail of blood or other sign of disturbance between the office and that location.  From this I conclude that Mr Chong initiated his attack in the office and that Mr Park fled into the factory where he was caught and further beaten.  The body was found lying face down.  There was the impression of the sole of a shoe on the lower back.  Mr Chong must have brought or beaten the deceased to the ground and then stood on him whilst he mercilessly beat him to death.
13After the event Mr Chong said certain things suggestive of there having been a robbery; for example, he said that when he arrived at the factory in the afternoon he found a window was broken and the door was left open.  A safe in the office which should have contained a significant amount of cash was found to contain only coins.  Four bank notes were found on the factory floor between the office and the body.  They were facing the same way up and were spaced relatively evenly apart.  The chances of a robber dropping money and it being found in that fashion is unlikely.  The door to the safe was found to be closed, something it is unlikely a robber would bother to do.  It is also unlikely that a robber would have found it necessary to beat Mr Park so severely.  Further, despite what Mr Chong claimed, police found no sign of forced entry to the premises.  I am satisfied that he made an elementary and amateurish attempt to create the impression that there had been a robbery which had gone wrong.
The proceedings
14Mr Chong was served with a future Court Attendance Notice on 14 October 2009 while he was still in hospital.  There was a delay in the committal phase of the proceedings, undoubtedly because of his medical state.  Ultimately he was committed for trial on 8 December 2010.  
15On 18 August 2011 a fitness inquiry pursuant to s 11 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act) was conducted before Fullerton J. Her Honour concluded that Mr Chong was unfit to be tried and she referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  The Tribunal subsequently determined that he would not become fit to be tried within the ensuing 12 months.  The Director of Public Prosecutions advised pursuant to s 19 of the Act that he intended to proceed with the charge of murder.  As a consequence the matter was listed for special hearing pursuant to s 21 of the Act.  
16A special hearing is to be conducted by a judge sitting alone unless the accused elects to have the matter determined by a jury.  There was an election made on behalf of Mr Chong by his legal representative.  Accordingly the matter proceeded before a jury at a special hearing which commenced on 12 September 2012.  It culminated in the jury finding on 5 October 2012 that Mr Chong committed the offence of murder.
Background to the murder
17Mr Chong came to Australia some 30 years ago.  At some stage whilst living with his wife in Perth he took employment with a Korean company that conducted a scrap metal business there.  Scrap metal was purchased and shipped to Korea where it was on sold at a profit in Korea and China.  In early 2008 the principals of the company established a similar business in Sydney at Wetherill Park. Mr Chong was sent to manage the Sydney operation.
18By late 2008 the principals came to suspect that he had been embezzling money from the business.  An investigation was carried out and it was determined that there was a deficiency of $213,429.
19The principals of the company were obviously concerned about this and took a number of steps to prevent any further embezzlement by Mr Chong.  There was an obstacle to simply dismissing him from his employment because he was the only person associated with the company who held Australian citizenship.  One of the steps taken was to send the deceased to Australia in late March 2009 to work with and supervise Mr Chong.
20Whilst the principals, Mr Nam Jim Kim and Mr Weon Gyu Lim, occasionally spent time in Australia working on the business, from about mid April 2009 the deceased and Mr Chong were the only people working at the Wetherill Park premises.
21There was a considerable body of evidence before the jury to the effect that Mr Park was experiencing immense difficulty in working and living with Mr Chong.  Evidence of his conversations, both oral and by way of internet chat sessions with family and friends in Korea, were to the effect that he was making Mr Park's life extremely miserable.  It is evident that Mr Chong was considerably antagonistic towards him.  I infer that this was, at least in part, because of the role Mr Park played in overseeing Mr Chong's access to company funds.  There was evidence of Mr Chong becoming very angry as requests for money were denied; he would swear at and abuse Mr Park for prolonged periods and would shake his fists at him in a threatening manner.  On one occasion Mr Park said that if anything happened to him it would be Mr Chong who was responsible.
22There was also evidence before the jury tending to suggest that Mr Chong had a gambling problem which may have provided him with a motive for embezzlement.  However the evidence of a gambling problem was rather tenuous.  The Crown relied upon the evidence of his former wife who maintained quite stridently in her evidence before the jury that he had a longstanding problem with gambling.  But that was in contrast to what she had told the police in a statement made in July 2009 where she was strident in asserting the exact opposite.  I am not satisfied that a conclusion can be drawn as to the nature and extent of any problem Mr Chong had with gambling.  I find it unnecessary to dwell upon the issue in any event.
23I find it equally unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Mr Chong had in fact embezzled money from the company.  He may well have but a finding against him in that respect is not a significant matter for present purposes.  What is significant is that the principals of the company suspected he had done so and he knew that they so suspected.  
24Even more significant is the nature of the relationship between Mr Chong and the deceased.  It was, as I have described, one of mutual dislike and on the part of Mr Chong, antagonism and frustration.  It must have been particularly galling for him that a young man had been sent from Korea to oversee the running of a business that he, a man in his late sixties, had previously been entrusted to run alone.
Basis for murder
25I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and it is consistent with the verdict of the jury, that Mr Chong killed the deceased by inflicting numerous ferocious blows with the metal stake.  It is abundantly clear from the nature and number of injuries sustained that this was done with an intent to kill.
26Whilst Mr Chong clearly now suffers from a substantial intellectual impairment as a result of the catastrophic brain injury suffered in the motor vehicle collision, there is no evidence to suggest that he had any mental health issues or intellectual impairment at the time of the offence.
Subjective features
27Mr Chong was born in 1942 and so was aged 67 at the time of the offence.  He is now 70 years old.  
28He has no previous criminal convictions in New South Wales but he does in Western Australia.  In 2007 he was fined for an offence of common assault.  In the mid to late 1990's he was dealt with by way of fines for unlawful wounding, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault, and received a suspended sentence of 4 months imprisonment for the breach of a violence restraining order.  In 1984 there were two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he received fines.  The record contains a number of other entries for traffic and dishonesty matters which, for present purposes, are of no significance.  Overall, the record disentitles Mr Chong to the leniency that could be extended to a person with prior good character.
29A number of reports relating to the effects of Mr Chong's brain injury were tendered subsequent to the jury's verdict at the special hearing.  The latest dated 10 September 2012 is authored by Dr Welkee Sim, a specialist in geriatric medicine with Justice Health.  Mr Chong has been an inpatient in the Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit (ACRU) of the Long Bay Hospital since 24 November 2010.  He is held there as a forensic patient.  He previously spent almost a year in Liverpool Hospital.
30Dr Sim reports that the severity of Mr Chong's brain injury has caused significant cognitive impairment and although there has been some recovery, most of the deficits now appear to be permanent.  Dr Sim reports that, ""full recovery is not expected"".  Two neuropsychiatric assessments in Liverpool Hospital confirmed Mr Chong's cognitive deficits.
31Dr Sim's report continues:
Currently, he requires prompting and occasional supervision with his activities of daily living. He is able to understand simple instructions but has difficulty following more complex instructions. He has limited insight into his situation and does not understand why he is being kept in the current facility. He would not have the capacity to make lifestyle decisions, medical decisions and to manage his financial affairs. A public guardian has been appointed to manage his affairs.
Other than his cognitive deficits, he also suffers from pain in his right shoulder due to rotator cuff injury and osteoarthritis, hypercholesterolaemia, reduced vision in his right eye and mild bilateral hearing impairment.  
Since his admission to ACRU, he remains medically stable and has not exhibit [sic] any challenging behaviour. He has never been psychotic or suffers from depression. He did suffer a bout of pneumonia in October 2011 and was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital for treatment. He remains well since discharge. 
My opinion is that physically Mr Chong remains well and requires minimal assistance (mainly in the form of prompting for his activities of daily living). Cognitively however, he requires a supervised and secured environment to continue to function, especially if he is to be released into the community. A facility such as a secured nursing home would be appropriate for him and [a] potential facility has been identified. He has already been approved from the local Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) for high level care.
32In an earlier report of 29 June 2011, Dr Sim noted that Mr Chong had no recollection of the motor vehicle accident or of the crime that he had committed.  
33Some material relating to Mr Chong's background appears in a report by Dr Stephen Allnutt of 18 July 2011.  It includes that he was born in Korea.  He was educated to high school level.  He had no apparent difficulties at school or socially.  There were no behavioural problems.  
34Mr Chong came from a family of four.  His parents remained together.  He could not recall being exposed to domestic violence or any physical or sexual abuse.  It appears that the familial environment was loving and supportive.
35Further material emerged in the evidence given by Mrs Chong in the special hearing.  Mr Chong met her in Seoul in 1966.  They lived for a period of time in Korea and then he went to work in Vietnam.  In 1974 he left South Korea to come to Australia to work.  He received permanent residency in 1976.  He and his wife had two children.  Mrs Chong came to Perth with the children in 1977 and the couple received Australian citizenship in 1978.  Whilst living in Perth Mr Chong worked as a mechanic with a number of mining companies.  He began to work in the scrap metal business in Perth in 2006.  He came to Sydney in early 2008 to run the business at Wetherill Park but maintained contact with his wife who remained in Perth.  Following the motor vehicle collision on 13 July 2009 she visited him once at Liverpool Hospital but thereafter had no contact with him.  The couple were subsequently divorced.  Mr Chong's affairs were placed in the hands of the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian in November 2009.
Nomination of a limiting term
36The requirements for the nomination of a limiting term pursuant to the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900 were recently set out by Adamson J in R v Goodridge (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1180.  I gratefully adopt her Honour's summary:
[24] A verdict that the Forensic Patient committed the offence charged (s 22(1)(c)) is a ""qualified finding of guilt"" made in the absence of a conviction (s 22(3)(a)). Accordingly, by reason of s 23(1)(a), the Court must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
[25] Section 23(1)(b) of the Act defines limiting term as:
""... the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.""
[26] The effect of s 23(1)(b) of the Act is that the Court is obliged, when determining a limiting term, to adopt and apply all the statutory and common law principles of sentencing that apply to the sentencing of a person convicted of that offence: R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [13]. A limiting term is the period beyond which a person cannot be detained for the offence which was the subject of the special hearing: R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120; 108 A Crim R 85 at [30].
[27] In R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394; 62 NSWLR 181 (Mailes), Dunford J, with whom Adams and Howie JJ agreed, said, at [32] that the purpose of a limiting term:
""... is not to punish the person who has not been convicted of any crime, but to ensure that he or she is not detained in custody longer than the maximum the person could have been detained if so convicted following a proper trial...""
[28] Section 54D(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the standard non-parole period statutory scheme does not apply to the sentencing of a Forensic Patient to detention. Accordingly the ""sentence"" referred to in s 23 of the Act must be a reference to the total sentence and not to the non-parole period since there is no power to fix a non-parole period less than the total term: Mailes at [29].
Assessment of sentence
37There are three factors that are of particular relevance in assessing what sentence would have been considered appropriate if Mr Chong had been fit to be tried and had been found guilty following a normal trial.  They are the seriousness of the offence, Mr Chong's age and his mental condition.
38Mr Austin, counsel for Mr Chong, submitted that I should regard the objective seriousness of the offence as approaching, but still less than, the middle of the range.  I doubt that a finding of seriousness needs to be made with that level of precision but the submission is broadly equivalent to the view I have formed.  
39I accept that the killing of Mr Park was not the product of any premeditation.  It appears to have been something that occurred suddenly, as the culmination of ill-feeling by Mr Chong towards the deceased that had been brewing for some weeks.  The fatal assault, however, involved extreme ferocity and brutality; the deceased received a great many blows to his head and torso with a heavy metal stake.  The final blows were inflicted when he was lying face down on the ground with Mr Chong's foot on the small of his back. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least when the final blows were delivered Mr Chong had formed an intention to kill the deceased.
40Mr Chong's age and his severe intellectual impairment as a result of brain damage provide reasons for assessing a sentence that would be significantly less than otherwise would have been imposed.  The authorities are clear that advanced age is a relevant factor to be taken into account on sentence, albeit within limits.  They are also clear as to how the question of Mr Chong's intellectual impairment should be taken into account.  I accept the submission by Mr Austin that it is relevant in this case in two respects.  The first is that it justifies no weight being given to either general or personal deterrence.  The second is that time in custody will be more onerous for Mr Chong because of his impairment, coupled with his age, than it would be for the average inmate of a correctional centre.  The Crown Prosecutor, most fairly, did not take issue with any of Mr Austin's submissions on these matters.
41The view I have formed as to what sentence would otherwise have been imposed upon Mr Chong has been influenced by the submission by the Crown Prosecutor as to an appropriate range.  Mr Austin regarded that range as appropriate, although submitted that for the reasons identified in the preceding paragraph the term to be nominated should be towards the lower end of that range.  My view is to the contrary because of the significant objective seriousness of the offence.
Victim impact
42Victim impact statements by five members of Mr Park's family were tendered by the Crown.  They make abundantly clear that the sadness involved in this case centres upon the effect that this most dreadful crime has had upon them.  Each of the statements eloquently describe the extreme loss and grief they have experienced.  It is no overstatement to say that the lives of many people have been irreparably changed for the worse because Do Hyun Chong took their loved one from them.  On behalf of the Court, the community, and myself I convey to each of Jong Hwa Park's family, extended family and friends the most sincere condolences.
Commencement date
43Mr Chong has been in custody since 30 July 2010 and so the limiting term I nominate will be specified to have commenced then.  
Conclusion 
44If the special hearing had been a normal trial of a person fit to be tried and a guilty verdict had been returned, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.   The best estimate of the term of such a sentence is one of 15 years.
45I nominate a limiting term of 15 years, to date from 30 July 2010.

2760340,Bathurst Regional Council as Trustee for the Bathurst City Council Crown Reserves Reserve Trust v Thompson [2012] NSWCA 340,"Judgment

1MEAGHER JA: I agree with Hoeben JA.

2HOEBEN JA: 
Nature of appeal
On 10 November 2007 the respondent suffered serious injuries when he fell while descending steps on a Victorian era rotunda, located in Machattie Park, Bathurst. He brought proceedings in negligence against the appellant as the trustee of the occupier of the rotunda. He was successful and recovered damages against the appellant.

3The appellant has appealed against the finding of liability and in respect of the award of damages for future loss of earning capacity.

Factual background

4The respondent, with a teaching colleague and a friend, Ms Gray, travelled to Bathurst on the Remembrance Day weekend in November 2007. On 10 November the three visited Machattie Park, which is the property of the Bathurst City Council Crown Reserves Reserve Trust (the Trust). The case was conducted on the basis that the Bathurst Regional Council (the appellant) was the Trustee. The respondent had not been to the park since his childhood days. 

5Located in the park was a Victorian era rotunda. The floor surface of the rotunda was raised and there were four entrances to it. Each entrance comprised a number of steps. While in the park, the three entered the rotunda and spent some three minutes or so admiring aspects of the park. They then determined to leave the rotunda from the north-western entrance/exit. This entrance/exit comprised four concrete steps, bordered by two sandstone retaining walls. It was different to the one by which they had gained access to the rotunda.

6As the respondent left the rotunda deck, he placed his left foot on the top step. The front half of his foot was overhanging that step. As he carried his right foot through the air with the intention of placing it onto the next (lower) step, his left foot also moved involuntarily forward in response to the transfer of his full body weight to that foot. Unable to maintain his footing, he fell down the stairs, seriously fracturing his left tibia and the neck of the fibula.

7The respondent was aged 50 at the time of the accident and had worked as a teacher since 1979 at the Bowral Public School. Before this accident he had no physical disability. He ran, walked, played tennis and on occasions visited the gymnasium. As part of his teaching duties, he taught Physical Education, as well as training and coaching sporting teams.

8Following the accident, the respondent was taken by ambulance to the Bathurst Base Hospital and from there was transferred to the Bowral Southern Highlands Private Hospital. Surgery was performed on his left leg on the Sunday afternoon. He remained at the Southern Highlands Private Hospital for a week. While convalescing, he developed a staphylococcal infection in the wound. He did not return to work until the end of April 2008, initially on a part-time basis. He has been left with a significant limitation of movement in the left leg but despite his disability, has been able to continue in his employment as a teacher.

The evidence at trial

9On the day following the accident, the respondent's two companions returned to the rotunda. The evidence of Ms Gray, with respect to that visit was:

""Q. What did you do on this further visit to the Machattie Park on the Sunday?
A. Went and had a look at the steps around the rotunda.

Q. What did you observe?
A. That the steps we walked up were different to the steps we walked down and that the steps we walked down, the top step was narrower than any of the others."" (Black 43P-R)

10The respondent went to Machattie Park just before he returned to work for the purpose of having a look at the place where the injury occurred. His evidence on this issue was:

""A. I noticed - sort of went through the accident again, if you like, with a little bit of trepidation standing on the top of the floor of the rotunda at the stairs where I walked forward and slid down. I noticed that the step on the - on the top of the staircase which I went to go down was much narrower in width than the length of my shoe. In actual fact, if I put my foot onto the top step, like I did on that day then when I just pivoted that forwarded that the ball of my foot, that front area behind the toes is actually not supported by any stair at all and I could see it was - no wonder that when I lifted my right foot off there was nothing to actually support my - my weight as I made my normal progression down the staircase."" (Black 22D-G)

11Exhibit A6 is a photograph showing the respondent's left foot on the relevant step, in the position that he described in his evidence. The photograph shows a little over half of the foot supported by the step. In particular, the ball of the foot and toes were not on or supported by the step.

12There were no signs anywhere about the rotunda, warning of the narrowness of the top step. Although the issue of contributory negligence was run at trial, it was not raised in the appeal. The appellant accepted that the respondent exercised appropriate care when descending the steps. 

13Support for the respondent's case was provided by an engineer, Mr Burn. He visited the rotunda in April 2011 and prepared a report, dated 23 April.

14Mr Burn observed that there were no handrails associated with the rotunda steps. The park was well maintained with landscaped gardens, a fernery, a flower house and a fountain. The rotunda was located adjacent to the fountain. He described the rotunda as a wooden structure, surrounded by a flowerbed.

15Mr Burn described the steps on which the respondent was injured. They were constructed of concrete, which had worn with time. There were no anti-slip strips on the nosings of the steps, which were exposed to the elements. The steps were cracked with pieces missing. The landing had a timber tread, which was worn smooth with cracks. 

16When Mr Burn measured the goings (i.e. the width) of the steps on which the respondent fell, the top step measured 190 mm and the lower three steps each measured 240 mm. The top step was that on which the respondent slipped. In relation to that step, Mr Burn said:

""The step is not of sufficient width to accommodate the foot and therefore does not provide stability, shape/lateral position under shoe."" (Blue 12R)

17Mr Burn observed what appeared to be modifications to the rotunda in that concrete had been poured on the inside of it as part of a maintenance program. This had the effect of raising the interior level of the rotunda. It also had the effect of allowing concrete to encroach upon the top step, thereby reducing the width of its going. In relation to that work, Mr Burn said:

""On completion of this work and at regular intervals, risk assessment inspections ought to have been undertaken to reveal hazards caused by the work or due to wear and tear. Had this procedure been undertaken, the hazard would have been identified and could have been remedied."" (Blue 14D-F)

18Mr Burn described the circumstances prevailing at the time of the accident as follows:

""Therefore, at the time of injury, the following situation was in place:

(a)The treads of the landing and steps were worn, cracked and with pieces missing.
(b)The nosings of the steps were rounded and worn.
(c)The top going was shortened by modification works and was not of sufficient width to provide stability when descending.
(d)There were no anti-slip strips at the nosings.
(e)There was no handrail.
(f)The steps were perceived as being uniform (as is typical with most non-spiral stairs).
(g)There were no warnings signs."" (Blue 15C-J)

19Mr Burn suggested that the accident could have been avoided by the following action:

""(a)Placing warning signs advising of the dangers of using the steps at suitable locations near the exit.
(b)By installing railings to provide stability.
(c)By placing anti-slip strips at the nosing of each step and landing.
(d)Reconstruct the rotunda steps in accordance with current standards (at the next rotunda refurbishment) to remove the hazard presented by uneven steps."" (Blue 20Q-U)

20Mr Burn gave evidence and was cross-examined. In that evidence, Mr Burn explained that where the edge of a step was worn it effectively reduced the available going of that step. If the going of a step were too narrow, this would cause a person descending those steps to ""overstep"", which ""increases the risk the foot will slide off the edge and the person will be thrown off balance"". (Black 59M)

21Mr Burn said that the nosing on the steps could be repaired for $100 for each step. The cost of non-slip metal edges would have been approximately $100 per step to a maximum of $1000 for all four steps.

22In relation to the concrete which had encroached upon the top step, Mr Burn advised that it could be removed by chipping away that section of cement so as to cause the going of that step to match the steps below it. His estimate of cost for that was ""a few hundred dollars at least"" (Black 72L, 73H, 73L).

23Mr Burn described the process as follows:

""Q. How could you propose alterations to the steps without knowing how the rotunda was built?
A. From examining that top step, the front edge or the riser has been modified in the past by the fact that it has a different texture and a different coloured concrete and it has spilled out under what looks like a bit of timber used to form it up, so to me that means that top step has been modified in the past so all I'm looking at doing is taking a modification off to go back and widen the step."" (Black 79O-R)

""Q. But you have no basis for making that assumption do you?
A. The fact that the concrete is different, the fact that it shows evidence of having been formed up at a later time with the concrete across the - going on that top step gives me the - you only see that when you form concrete and pour it and you don't seal it properly at the bottom and it spills out of the formwork so that means at some stage that has been modified from what it was originally."" (Black 79W-Y, 80C)

24Mr Burn estimated that the modifications affecting the top step had been carried out between 10 and 15 years before he made his inspection. He reached that conclusion on the following basis:

""A. The difference in colour of the concrete, the age of the structure, the last time it was likely refurbished, being the sort of thing it is you have to periodically maintain them."" (Black 83P-Q)

""Q. Part of the basis for that conclusion is your experience about how often buildings need maintenance?
A. Having worked in Local Council and having been involved and - well having worked with the Parramatta park engineer when I was at Parramatta knowing how often they had to maintain the structures in Parramatta Park, that sort of life expectancy between major maintenance was quite normal."" (Black 84F-H)

25No evidence was called by the appellant. By consent, counsel for the appellant read onto the record the following admissions made by the respondent:


The rotunda was designed by J Hine and built in 1890.
The rotunda is heritage listed.
The rotunda is one of the pivotal features of Machattie Park.
The rotunda is used by many people, including the Bathurst City and RSL Concert Bands.

Proceedings in the District Court

26Nicholson DCJ, in his judgment delivered on 7 November 2011, rejected the appellant's submission that, because ""many people"" used the rotunda and no evidence had been adduced of any accidents, the Court should infer that no accident involving the rotunda steps had occurred. In that regard, his Honour noted that neither the appellant nor the respondent led any evidence as to the past accident history of the rotunda. He noted that there was no evidence that any accidents had occurred, nor was there evidence that accidents had not occurred.

27His Honour said:

""96... The absence of evidence can hardly amount to proof of a proposition for which there is admittedly no evidence. Sometimes it may make an inference available. However, in this case, the absence of evidence did not amount to proof of the claim made in the defence pleadings that the defendant had not received prior reports, or that there had been no injury. Both sides had made contradictory assertions in their pleadings. For different reasons, neither side proved its claim. The state of the evidence was really to take prior accident history and prior knowledge or absence of knowledge of accident history out of action for either side."" (Red 25V-X, 26B-C)

28His Honour found the phrase ""many people"" to be imprecise in that there was no evidence as to which steps were used on the rotunda, what was the pattern of movement through the rotunda and what was the profile of persons using the rotunda, e.g. were they school children on class excursions or elderly citizens, tourists or locals? Accordingly, his Honour found the concession ""many people used the rotunda"" to be imprecise and not particularly helpful.

29At trial the appellant sought to rely upon s 42 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (CLA). His Honour rejected this submission on two bases:

""104While there is no doubt Bathurst Regional Council is a body politic constituted under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1993, the party who is in truth the defendant to these proceedings is the Bathurst City Council Crown Reserve Trust. Section 41 of the Act contains a comprehensive definition of ""public or other authority"". There was no dispute that definition embraces Bathurst Regional Council. However, there is no part of that definition that on its face applies to a trust. In particular there is no part of that definition that appears to apply to the Trust, which is the nominated defendant to these proceedings. Nor was any evidence led to advance a case of the Trust being a ""public or other authority"" entitled to the benefits provided by Part 5 of the Act. I reject the defence submissions on this aspect.

105... Frankly there is no direct evidence one way or the other as to the defendant's resource base or cash flow."" (Red 27L-R)

30An important part of the appellant's submissions at trial and in this appeal was that there was no evidence that it knew, or ought to have known, about any problem with the top step on the north-western entrance/exit of the rotunda. The appellant submitted that because the problem was not obvious until the step was measured, and there was no evidence of any regular inspection, foreseeability was not made out. This was because it was not reasonable to expect the appellant to be aware of the problem with that step.

31His Honour rejected that submission in the following terms:

""107I reject the submission that it is only through regular inspection that the defendant could have discovered the narrowness of the step closest to the deck. The plaintiff's case is not that the narrowness of the stairs was not obvious - but rather it was not obvious from the rotunda deck to a person about to embark upon descending the stairs. The narrowness of the stair close to the deck would be obvious to someone climbing it (see exhibit A4) and possibly to someone approaching them to ascend (exhibit A3).

108Further, my view is that the defendant must have knowledge of the dimensions of the stairs imputed to it from the time of construction. It is inconceivable to me that the defendant through its trustee constructed these stairs without a plan being approved by or on behalf of the trustee. The relevant step had been in existence for 10 to 15 years. Did no-one associated with the Trust visit this pivotal feature of the Machattie Park in all those years to inspect and sign off on the construction work associated with the rebuilding of the step?

109It was also argued that the proposition that discovery of the irregular geometry of these stairs required measuring them, and if that were so, in order to protect itself, the only way Council had of addressing the problem was to measure all stairs in the Local Government area. There are three problems with that submission. I am not concerned with the Local Council here - I am concerned with the Trust, which is the real defendant in these proceedings. There was no evidence as to the extent of the land holding of the Trust. 

110Secondly, there is no evidence that the discovery of irregular geometry was dependent upon measuring stairs. I have already suggested construction plans containing information. Visual inspections, reports and complaints are other methods.

111Finally, if one is concerned about the criteria of negligence, as determined by the interactions of the relevant parts of s 5B of the Act - surely the pre-eminence of a park and the pre-eminence of its pivotal features would play a part in determining whether probability of foreseeable harm demands response. A remote and little used area in a remote and little used park may be of less concern than a pivotal feature in a major park."" (Red 28B-P)

32His Honour also rejected the submission by the appellant that because the rotunda was heritage listed, no remedial action could be taken in relation to it such as erecting a sign or making any change to it. He did so because there was no evidence as to what restrictions, if any, the heritage listing imposed on the use of the rotunda. In the absence of such evidence, it would only be speculation on the court's part to reject the remedial steps proposed by Mr Burn on the basis that they would not be allowed because the rotunda was heritage listed. His Honour did accept the appellant's submission that a railing for these steps and not the others on the rotunda could adversely affect its symmetry.

33His Honour did not take into account Ordinance 70 and Australian Standard 1428.1, both of which regulated the width (going) of steps in certain circumstances. His Honour said:

""127Mr Sheldon's submissions urging little weight for Mr Burn's report is partially successful. I accept that Ordinance 70 and AS 1248.1 have not been demonstrated to have binding force upon the defendant. Burn's fallback position was that they had some relevance as standards by which best or, at least good practice, could be gauged when considering issues of safety and of minimal risk. As against that proposition which I am inclined to accept, there is no evidence of any general or broad based recognition of those standards for that purpose by the community, or builders, or indeed, the defendant or those advising it at the time when the north-western stairs, or top step, were constructed up to 15 years ago. For that reason the standards as found in Ordinance 70 and AS 1428.1 will play no further part in the outcome of this matter."" (Red 31H-M)

34His Honour then set out his primary factual findings:


""The rotunda is a pivotal feature of Machattie Park.
One of the attractions of the rotunda is its compass point uniformity with the stairway and stairs being the key feature of the compass point uniformity.
The rotunda is on flat ground and each of the four stairways has approximately the same number of stairs.
The plaintiff accessed the rotunda deck from the south-eastern side.
The step closest to the deck of the rotunda on the south-eastern side has a going of 210 mm.
In the absence of a warning sign there was no reason for the plaintiff to believe the north western exit stairway was constructed any differently to or contained any hazard not existing on the south eastern stairway.
As he moved to the north-western stairs he looked at the approach to the stairs.
When at the top of the staircase he saw the treads of the stairs leading to the pebble pathway in the lower aspect of his vision. I am satisfied he was not relying upon his peripheral vision - but rather some lowering of the eyes so that the lower area of his vision was focused on the stairs and path below.
At that angle, what he saw was an apparent uniformity of the stairs (see exhibit A5), consistent with the south-eastern stairs he earlier had climbed. From this vantage the risk of harm from the narrow tread of the closest stair was not obvious to him.
What was hidden from his vision - because of a wooden beam forming the north western lip of the rotunda deck, was the narrowness of the step closest to the rotunda deck by comparison with the corresponding step on the south-eastern stairway.
Likewise what was hidden from his vision - because of that wooden beam was the narrowness of the step closest to the rotunda deck by comparison with the other three steps he was intending to place his boot upon.
The step closest to the rotunda deck on the north-western exit has a going of 190 mm - 20 mm narrower than the corresponding step on the south eastern side and 50 mm narrower than the three steps below it.
Because of the difference in size of the going on the corresponding step on the south-eastern stairway, his prior experience in ascending those steps had an effect of misleading him as to the significant difference in size of the closest step on the north-western stairway.
The plaintiff placed his left foot on the tread of the closest step to the wooden beam. I am satisfied it was placed close to the riser - but am not prepared to find it was jammed back against the riser.
If it had been placed close to the riser, the plaintiff would only be able to fit something in the order of 56-58 percent of his boot upon this step.
The plaintiff's footwear was more than appropriate for the task in hand.
The treads of the landing and steps, including the closest step, were worn and cracked with pieces missing.
The nosing of the steps including the closest step were rounded and worn.
There were no anti-slip strips at the nosing of the closest step - or any other step.
There was no handrail to hold so as to retain balance or minimise the fall.
The going of the closest step had been shortened by modification works.
The going of the closest step was of insufficient width to provide stability to an adult male wearing a boot the same size or larger than the boot size worn by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff lifted his right foot from the wooden beam, intending to place it on the tread of the step one lower than the closest step.
As he commenced to transfer his weight from the right to the left and adjusting the distribution of his weight in anticipation of the right foot landing on the lower step, there was insufficient tread surface to support enough of the front portion of his left foot, which as a consequence skidded off the closest step.
The absence of an anti-skid strip on the nosing and the generally poor surface condition of the tread meant there was nothing to inhibit or restrict the skidding left foot even momentarily to provide an opportunity for reflex action by the plaintiff.
The forward momentum of the upper body and the right foot meant the plaintiff lost all balance. Meanwhile his left leg slipped down across the lower step and the next one. The plaintiff's weight following the motion of his right foot resulted in his turning to his right as he fell.
In the course of falling by some mechanism I am not able to identify with precision, intolerable pressure was placed on the tibia and the neck of the fibula. The plaintiff heard a loud crack caused by the fracture of these bones. 
The plaintiff finished the fall straddled across the staircase."" (Red 32H-33R)

35His Honour's reasoning towards a finding of negligence was:

""135The principal factors playing a part in this injury are the absence of a warning sign, the narrowness of the going of the closest step; the poor condition of the surface of that step, and causes was the absence of a warning sign and the narrowness of the going. I am satisfied if there had been a warning sign or the going had been at least the same width at the south eastern going on the corresponding step or the width of the other going on the lower steps on the north western stairway, the fall would not have occurred.

136... But it is also common knowledge the narrower a stair tread the greater the risk of injury. There comes a point in time when a stair tread can be so narrow as to be inherently dangerous. 

...

139In this case what lifts the risk from an insignificant foreseeable risk to a significant one is the geometry of the closest stair, and the absence of any warning sign indicating a narrow step and the need for care or caution. This incident occurred in daylight on a dry day . ... This risk is heightened if the persons visiting the rotunda are unfamiliar with it. In the absence of any history to the contrary, and reliance, as the defence have urged, upon the plaintiff's admission of many people using the rotunda, the probability of harm occurring in the absence of remedial action is at least substantial and the more likely to be realised the greater the number of visitors, particularly visitors unfamiliar with the park.

...

141... However, the prospects of really serious injury occurring on a downward journey when the weight bearing foot is dislodged because of inadequate foot support is a different prospect. In those circumstances, really serious injury would not be unexpected.

142In the absence of direct evidence, I am forced to draw some inferences about the resources available to the trust. I have deliberately distinguished the defendant trust from the trustee. No evidence of the defendant's resources has been led by the defence - I can only assume that to have done so would not have been of advantage to the defence. Such inferences as I draw must be consistent with the available evidence. The pictures I have seen of the rotunda and its surrounds make clear the defendant has resources sufficient to maintain the heritage building, its immediate surrounds, gardens, fountain and the park generally to a very high standard. Any burden of taking precautions must be measured against that standard. Likewise, I have no evidence of any commitment the defendant has beyond Machattie Park. My assessment of the burden of taking precautions must be measured against what I know - rather than speculating. I am satisfied the placing of a warning sign or signs on either pillar forming the outer border of the stairwell appropriately worded so as to caution against the identified risk of a narrow stair would not be overly burdensome to the defendant. In this case a warning sign would have been sufficient. I have already made that finding. It can be made with some confidence because the uncontested evidence of the plaintiff is he would have heeded an appropriate warning sign.

143The item creating the risk of harm is the narrow stair tread on the top step. The social utility of that step is determined by the part it plays in access to and egress from the deck of the rotunda. It also forms part of the four stairways that add a visual aesthetic quality to the rotunda.

144The cost of repairing the stair would be significantly more than placing a sign. Mr Burn's solution to widening the step without reconstructing the whole stairway required removing the raised concrete band that abuts the timber. The effect of that would be to make the stair tread level throughout, but that action does not represent an optimum solution. It would serve to mitigate, although not remove the step as a contributor to a risk of injury. The remedial step proposed by Mr Burn would not interfere with the social utility of the stairs, but would enhance the safety of the stair in the performance of social utility activity. I am satisfied there are remedial actions available that would not impede or diminish the social utility of the stair.

145In light of the above reasons, I am satisfied the injury to the plaintiff was the result of the negligence of the defendant, its employees or agents. I base my finding of negligence on the failure of the defendant to provide a step of sufficient width to adequately support the plaintiff's foot, accompanied by a failure to warn the plaintiff that the step was of inadequate width. As I noted above, the defendant's failure to provide a slip-resistant edge on the step also played a part - although a less significant one."" (Red 33S-35U)

THE APPEAL
Submissions and consideration

Ground of Appeal 1: His Honour erred in finding that the occupier of Machattie Park (the Park) at Bathurst was the ""Bathurst City Council Reserve Trust"".

Ground of Appeal 2: His Honour should have found that the occupier of the Park was the Bathurst City Council or Bathurst City Council as trustee for the Bathurst City Council Reserve Trust.

Ground of Appeal 3: His Honour erred in failing to apply the provisions of s 42 of the Civil Liability Act 2002.

36These grounds of appeal can be conveniently dealt with together since they raise the same issue. It is assumed that the reference in the Ground of Appeal to the Bathurst City Council is a reference to the Bathurst Regional Council which was the party named in the pleadings.

37The relevant provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (CLA) are:

""41In this Part:
...
public or other authority means:

... 

(d) a local council, or
(e) any public or local authority constituted by or under an Act, or

...

42The following principles apply in determining whether a public or other authority has a duty of care or has breached a duty of care in proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies:

a) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the authority for the purpose of exercising those functions,

(b) the general allocation of those resources by the authority is not open to challenge,

(c) the functions required to be exercised by the authority are to be determined by reference to the broad range of its activities (and not merely by reference to the matter to which the proceedings relate),

(d) the authority may rely on evidence of its compliance with the general procedures and applicable standards for the exercise of its functions as evidence of the proper exercise of its functions in the matter to which the proceedings relate.""

38The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to apply s42 CLA because he concluded that the true occupier of the park and rotunda was the Bathurst City Council Reserves Reserve Trust which was not a ""public or other authority"" to which the provisions of s42 CLA would apply. The appellant submitted that a trust was not a separate legal entity and had no separate existence (St George Bank Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] 176 FCR 242; 256 ALR 391; [2009] FCAFC 62, Perram J at [88]). The appellant submitted that the Trust could not in truth be the defendant. The true defendant was therefore the appellant which came within the definition of a public authority in s41 CLA and accordingly, his Honour was obliged to apply s42.

39The appellant submitted that the application of s42 to the facts required that his Honour apply the principles set out in the section. It submitted that if his Honour had applied those principles, he would have recognised that there was a limitation on the resources available to it. It submitted that he would have had to consider the broad range of its activities when assessing whether it was reasonable to require it to eliminate the risk created by the step on which the respondent slipped. 

40There are a number of difficulties with this submission. The first is that the point that the Trust was not a legal entity was not taken at trial. On the contrary, the appellant in its pleadings admitted that it was the Trustee and that the Trust occupied the park including the rotunda. No information or evidence was provided to the court concerning the relationship between the Council and the Trust.

41The following submissions were made at trial:

""HIS HONOUR: I want to ask you about that. It's being sued in its role as a Trustee of this park; do I have to be concerned about what responsibilities it had in other parks?

COUNSEL: Yes your Honour. Because it is the Local Government authority and s 42 of the Civil Liability Act, which I can hand a copy up to your Honour, says that your Honour has to take account of all of the public authority's responsibilities. 

HIS HONOUR: Even when its being sued as a Trustee for some other mob?
COUNSEL: As I understand the section your Honour, but I would have to concede that that point has not been decided ...

HIS HONOUR: Does this only apply to them when you're suing them - and maybe they are being sued as a public authority, but it seems to me they're being sued as the trustee, but it may be that the mob that they're trustees of is a public authority, I don't know. It's a query whether s 42 applies and somebody's going to have to tell me.
COUNSEL: In my submission it does your Honour and so far as I am aware, there's no authority which says that because it's being sued as a Trustee for a public park, it is no longer to be treated as a public authority for the purposes of s 42. But in any event, the section does say whether a public or other authority has a duty of care or has breached a duty of care.

HIS HONOUR: I'll have a look at that. At first blush you'd think that they must have covered it somehow. I know nothing about parks; I mean are all parks set up in this way?
COUNSEL: Some are vested directly in the Council your Honour and some which as I understand the way it works, some which were once State run, upon creation of the Council vest through a trust. I wouldn't want to take it any further than that your Honour at this stage, I'd need to have a look at precisely how it worked in this case. But a proposition which I won't go too deeply into elaborating at this point until I can enlighten your Honour as to the sequence by which we became the trustee, the general proposition is that your Honour has to have regard to the functions required to be exercised."" (Black 102B-F, M-X)

42That is how the matter was left and no further assistance was provided to the court. For this point to be now taken, it was necessary for the appellant to provide at the very least, evidence as to the matters foreshadowed in the exchange with the trial judge, i.e. more information about the relationship between the Council and the Trust. 

43The Trust is described in the statement of claim as ""Bathurst City Council Crown Reserves Reserve Trust"". That suggests that a reserve trust may have been formed under Division 4 of Part 5 of the Crown Lands Act 1989. Under s 92 of that Act, the Minister administering the Act may by notification in the Gazette establish and name a reserve trust and appoint it as trustee of one or more specified reserves. That reserve trust is constituted as a corporation (s 92(2)) and charged with the care, control and management of the reserve (s 92(5)). Under s 95(1), the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, also appoint a local council to manage the affairs of the reserve trust. Where a council manages a reserve trust, the trust has all the functions of a council under the Local Government Act 1993 in relation to public reserves (s 98(1)). Those provisions are relevantly conferred in respect of public land by Part 2 of Chapter 6 of the Local Government Act. 

44The proceedings were conducted on the basis that the appellant owned and occupied the park in its capacity as a trustee. It should be noted that this does not accurately reflect the true position as to ownership of the park. The Bathurst City Council Crown Reserves Reserve Trust was established by a notification in New South Wales Government Gazette No 57 dated 12 May 1995. That notification also appointed that reserve trust as trustee of Machattie Park (being the reserve land in Dedication 590114 notified in the Government Gazette dated 10 December 1904). In addition, the notification in Gazette No 57 appointed Bathurst City Council to manage the affairs of that reserve trust. Bathurst Regional Council is the successor of the Bathurst City Council and was constituted in May 2004.

45Had the proceedings been conducted on the basis that the reserve trust was a separate legal entity and responsible for the care, control and management of the park, it would have been necessary, when addressing the operation of s 42 CLA, to consider whether the reserve trust is the ""Crown"" or a ""public or local authority"" within the meaning of s 41 CLA. Although the proceedings were conducted on the basis that the appellant owned and occupied the park as a trustee, it is unnecessary to consider the appellant's argument that s 42 was capable of applying to it notwithstanding that the council was acting in a capacity as trustee. That is because the appellant led no evidence so as to engage the application of s 42.

46Implicit in the appellant's submission is an assumption that the trial judge was obliged to take into account those ""principles"" even if no evidence of any of the matters in s42 was adduced. That is not so. A simple reading of the section makes that clear. There has to be evidence of ""the financial and other resources"" that are available to the authority and ""the general allocation by it"" of those resources. There needs to be evidence as to the range of the authority's activities. Without that basic material, a court has nothing upon which to apply the principles in the section.

47If there were any doubt as to the correctness of that approach to s42, it was resolved by the careful analysis of the section by Campbell JA and Sackville AJA in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Refrigerated Roadways Pty Limited [2009] NSWCA 263. There, Campbell JA relevantly said:

""395The effect of section 42(a) in the present case is that what the RTA can be required by the law of negligence to do is limited by the financial and other resources that are reasonably available to the RTA for the purpose of carrying out the care, control and management of freeways and any other roads that are under its care, control and management. Its budget for that purpose is so large that any expenditure that would have been involved in earlier screening of the Glenlee Bridge, or indeed in earlier screening of all overpasses on freeways would have been well within its budget. 

396When section 42(b) uses the expression ""those resources"" it is referring back to section 42(a). What section 42(b) requires not to be challenged, in the present case, is the ""general allocation"" by the RTA of those resources that are reasonably available to the RTA for the purpose of the care control and management of freeways and other roads under its care control and management. 

397There is an important difference in prepositions between section 42(a) and section 42(b). Section 42(a) is concerned with the resources reasonably available to the authority, while section 42(b) is concerned with the allocation of those resources by the authority. In other words, section 42(b) starts from the position that certain resources are reasonably available to the authority, and considers the allocation that is made by the authority of those resources.""

48Sackville AJA made observations to similar effect:

""449Subject to the effect of ss 42 and 43A of the Civil Liability Act, I see no compelling reason in the present case, whether deriving from distinctions sometimes drawn between policy and operational matters or otherwise, for the Court to shy away from undertaking the assessment contemplated by s 5B, in particular weighing up the matters identified in s 5B(2). This requires the Court to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the RTA would have fenced the Glenlee Bridge notwithstanding competing claims on its resources to address similar risks of serious injury elsewhere. In making this determination, the Court needs to consider whether the RTA's ordering of priorities was a departure from standards to be expected from a reasonable person in the RTA's position. The Court should also take account of the opportunities reasonably available to the RTA to gain additional funding from the Commonwealth or other sources for the purpose of addressing particularly acute risks of which it was aware or should have been aware.

450Campbell JA's analysis of the facts in this case seems to me to show that the RTA appreciated in a reasonably timely fashion the nature and magnitude of the risk to road users, including the risk to users of the F5 from the Glenlee Bridge, by reason of objects being thrown or falling from overpasses. The RTA's response to the risk, having regard to the burden of taking precautions to alleviate the risk of harm to all road users from similar sources, was not shown to be unreasonable. The RTA adopted a rational and apparently systematic (although not perfect) approach to assessing priorities for the erection of protective fencing on the basis of the magnitude of risk. It acted on that assessment within the limits of available resources. The evidence does not demonstrate that a reasonable authority in the position of the RTA would have sought additional funding from the Commonwealth or that, if it did, such funding would have been made available for fencing the Glenlee Bridge before the incident that led to Mr Evans' death.""

49Not only do those paragraphs helpfully set out how s42 is to be applied but it is apparent from their content that the issues there under consideration depended upon the evidence which the RTA gave concerning the particular subject matter of s42. Without that evidence, there was no subject matter to which the s42 principles could be applied.

50No evidence of any of those matters was adduced by the appellant. It follows that even if his Honour had found that s42 applied to this case, the section had no practical application in the absence of some evidence with respect to the various subject matters referred to in it. These grounds of appeal have not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 4: His Honour erred in that he failed to properly apply s5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002.

Ground of Appeal 7: His Honour erred in finding that the appellant knew of the geometric deficiency in the stairs on which the respondent fell.

Ground of Appeal 9: His Honour erred in finding that the appellant had been negligent.

51Section 5B CLA provides:

""5(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b) the risk was not insignificant, and

(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.

(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.""

52The appellant accepted that there was always a foreseeable risk of injury when a person descended stairs, but it did not concede that there was any basis for a finding that it knew, or ought to have known, about the particular risk of harm which this step gave rise to, i.e. the risk of falling because of the inadequacy of its width.

53The appellant specifically challenged the findings of his Honour at [107] - [111] of his judgment (see [31] hereof). The appellant submitted that his Honour had speculated as to the existence of a plan when the modifications to the rotunda and top step had taken place 10 or 15 years before the inspection by Mr Burn. The appellant submitted that there was no evidence to support the existence of any such plan. It submitted that even if the existence of a plan could be properly inferred, there was no evidence of the detail which it would have possessed.

54The appellant submitted that the finding that an inspection of the steps would have revealed the narrowness of the top step was contrary to the evidence of Mr Burn. It submitted that the evidence of Mr Burn was that the steps gave the appearance of being uniform in size and that it was only when the steps were actually measured that the problem with the top step was revealed. The appellant submitted that there was nothing about the appearance of the steps to alert a person to the fact that they were not uniform. The appellant submitted that his Honour impermissibly sought to gain support for this finding from his interpretation of the photographs.

55The appellant submitted that there was no evidence of reports or complaints concerning this step, or any of the steps. The appellant submitted that the need to measure the steps in order to disclose the ""risk"", when coupled with the absence of evidence of any prior injury or complaint, compelled a conclusion that the appellant did not know of the risk and that there was no reason why it should have known. Accordingly, the requirements of s5B(1)(a) CLA had not been made out.

56The appellant further submitted that in the absence of any complaint or previous injury in relation to this step, it would have been necessary for the appellant to examine and measure every step within its area of responsibility in order to identify a potential or inchoate risk. This was clearly an unreasonable requirement, given the comparatively heavy use of the rotunda and park, coupled with the absence of any previous injury or complaint.

57An important element of the appellant's submission is the proposition, which was rejected by the trial judge, that the lack of evidence of complaint or previous injury, coupled with the use of the park and rotunda by many people, required an inference to be drawn that there were no complaints and no previous injuries.

58That submission should not be accepted. The evidentiary position was as explained by his Honour. There was no evidence of complaints or previous injuries. This should be distinguished from evidence that there had been no complaints or previous injuries. They are two quite different things. The absence of evidence on the subject means that there could have been complaints or previous injuries, but there was simply no evidence either way.

59His Honour correctly concluded that a lack of evidence on the subject did not assist either party and that not only was he not required to draw the inference sought by the appellant, but it was not open to him to do so.

60If any inference were to be drawn, it would have been an inference adverse to the appellant. It was the party in the best position to provide evidence of whether there had been complaints or previous injuries, but it declined to do so. It was open to his Honour to draw an inference, had he so wished, that such evidence would not have assisted the appellant.

61In Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd [2011] HCA 11; 243 CLR 361 the plurality [Heydon Crennan and Bell JJ] said:

""63The rule in Jones v Dunkel is that the unexplained failure by a party to call a witness may in appropriate circumstances support an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the party's case. That is particularly so where it is the party which is the uncalled witness. The failure to call a witness may also permit the court to draw, with greater confidence, any inference unfavourable to the party that failed to call the witness, if that uncalled witness appears to be in a position to cast light on whether the inference should be drawn. ... 

64The rule in Jones v Dunkel permits an inference, not that evidence not called by a party would have been adverse to the party, but that it would not have assisted the party. ...""

62The appellant's submissions misunderstand the evidence given by the plaintiff, Ms Gray and Mr Burn and the use which his Honour made of the photographs. Mr Burn's evidence was to the effect that to a person standing at the top of the stairs preparing to descend, the steps would appear uniform. This was particularly so in relation to the first step. This was the very danger to which Mr Burn referred, i.e. that the imperfection in the step was hidden from a person about to descend the stairs. His evidence was not that the difference in width between the top step and the other steps was not visually obvious to a person ascending those steps, or looking at the steps from below. In particular, Mr Burn at no time said that the only way the difference between the top step and the other steps could be detected was by measuring their width.

63The evidence of Ms Gray was that she and the respondent's other friend went to the rotunda on the day following the accident and that they observed (without apparently any need to measure) the difference between the top step and the other steps. This was an observation made by the respondent before he returned to teaching. These observations were confirmed by photographs A3 and A4, as his Honour indicated.

64This was not an example of the judge impermissibly drawing inferences and reaching conclusions based on his own interpretation of the photographs. His Honour was doing no more than using the photographs to satisfy himself as to the reliability of evidence already given by other witnesses.

65The appellant's submissions misunderstand his Honour's analysis of the evidence and the way in which the respondent put his case. The respondent put his case in negligence on two bases - that the dangerous nature of the step had been caused by the deliberate action of the appellant and in the alternative, that there had been a failure on the part of the appellant to take appropriate remedial action by removing the concrete which narrowed the step, or by the other means identified by his Honour. The deliberate action asserted was the creation of the danger when the modification to the rotunda and the step took place some 10 or 15 years before Mr Burn made his inspection.

66In its defence the appellant had admitted that ""at all material times"" the appellant was trustee and that the Trust was the occupier of the park and rotunda. Accordingly, as his Honour found, the alterations to the rotunda, and therefore the creation of the problem with the top step, could only have occurred with the knowledge and consent of the appellant. Although there may not have been a plan prepared in relation to the work, the overwhelming inference is that someone from the appellant's organisation would have checked the work before payment was authorised. It should have been obvious to that person that the alterations to the rotunda had narrowed the width of the top step thereby creating a real and foreseeable risk of injury. 

67That was a finding open to his Honour which was based on the evidence and logical inferences drawn therefrom.

68In relation to the alternative basis upon which the respondent's claim was put, his Honour was entitled to infer that because the rotunda and its surrounds were well kept and were used by many people, that officers from the appellant would from time to time inspect the rotunda with a view to assessing its state of repair and safety. Mr Burn gave evidence to this effect at Blue 14C-F when he said:

""On completion of this work and at regular intervals, risk assessment inspections ought to have been undertaken to reveal hazards caused by the work or due to wear and tear. Had this procedure been undertaken, the hazard would have been identified and could have been remedied.""

69It follows that his Honour correctly found that the risk created by the narrowness of the top step was a risk which the appellant knew about, or ought to have known about. These grounds of appeal have not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 5: His Honour erred in finding that the evidentiary position in relation to the occurrence of prior accidents was ""neutral"". His Honour should have found:
(a)The respondent had adduced no evidence of prior accidents;
(b)There was relevantly therefore nothing of which the appellant could have given evidence as to its ignorance; and
(c)That the state of the evidence and admissions established that the rotunda had been used without incident for years.

70This ground of appeal has already been dealt with at [55] - [59]. As indicated, there is a significant distinction between there being no evidence about whether or not complaints had been made and previous accidents had occurred, and evidence to the effect that there had been no complaints and no previous accidents. The appellant has impermissibly sought to elide that distinction. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 6: His Honour impermissibly construed the meaning of a photograph for himself and not to resolve a controversy in evidence (Short v Barrett [1990] NSWCA 164).

71This ground of appeal is not made out. The error identified in Short v Barrett was an interpretation of a photograph by a trial judge in order to resolve a disputed issue of fact, contrary to the opinion of two experts whose evidence on the issue was not challenged. Moreover, the Court of Appeal when examining the same photograph was unable to identify or detect the particular matters on which the trial judge had relied. In identifying this error on the part of the trial judge, Meagher JA (with whom Clarke and Handley JJA agreed) referred with approval to the following dicta of Lord Reid in C Van der Lely NV v Bamfords Limited (1962) IA IPR 86 [1963] RPC 61 at 71:

""But the judge ought not, in my opinion to attempt to read or construe the photograph himself; he looks at the photographs in determining which of the explanations given by the witnesses appears to be most worthy of acceptance.""

72Here, as previously indicated, his Honour did not interpret the photographs for himself and base his decision upon his own interpretation. On the contrary, he used the photographs to confirm the evidence of Ms Gray, the respondent and Mr Burn and by reference to those photographs was able to satisfy himself that their evidence was reliable. I agree with his Honour's interpretation of the photographs. 

Ground of Appeal 8: His Honour impermissibly dealt with the respondent's admission as to the status and nature of the rotunda.

73The appellant submitted that his Honour did not give full effect to the admissions by the respondent. It submitted that by reference to the heritage listing of the rotunda, his Honour should have rejected the alternatives suggested by Mr Burn of a warning sign, or making any alteration to any aspect of the steps which were a key feature of the rotunda. The appellant submitted that having made the admissions, it was necessary for the respondent to prove that the erection of a warning sign and/or the modification to the top step could be accomplished within the limits of the heritage listing.

74For this ground of appeal to succeed, it was necessary for the appellant to adduce evidence as to the content of the heritage listing and in particular, any conditions applicable to the rotunda. Without that evidence, it would involve speculation to find whether or not a warning sign could be erected and whether or not an alteration could be made to the steps. 

75In relation to the top step, the proposed alteration was the chipping back of the concrete, which had protruded past the formwork, in order to increase the width of the step so that it conformed with the lower steps. It is difficult to see how such an adjustment could possibly offend any heritage listing.

76This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 10: His Honour erred in finding that the appellant's negligence was a cause of the respondent's damage.

77The appellant submitted that in relation to the failure to erect a warning sign, causation had not been established. It submitted that the respondent's evidence was that he was careful when descending the stairs because they looked steep and that consequently a warning sign would not have altered his behaviour and the accident would still have occurred.

78The appellant submitted that there was no evidence that the absence of non-slip strips on the stair nosings would have prevented the accident occurring.

79The unchallenged evidence of the respondent was that he would have heeded a warning sign, if one were provided. On the assumption that the warning sign would have identified the hazard with precision, i.e. that the top step was too narrow, it was open to his Honour to find that the respondent would have adjusted his method of descending the stairs to meet that risk. 

80The evidence of Mr Burn was that the absence of an anti-skid strip on the nosing of a step and the generally poor surface condition of the tread meant that there was nothing to inhibit or restrict the respondent's skidding left foot. His Honour made a finding to that effect at Red 33N, which was open to him on the evidence.

81This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 11: His Honour failed to conform to the requirements of s13 of the Civil Liability Act 2002.

82The appellant submitted that his Honour's finding of future loss of earning capacity was not open on the evidence. It submitted that his Honour's conclusion was that by reason of his injuries and disabilities, the respondent would not be able to take up part-time or casual employment after his retirement at age 67. His Honour found that the respondent would remain in fulltime employment as a teacher, albeit with some limitations, until that retirement age. It submitted that the respondent did not give evidence of any intention on his part to attempt part-time work after retirement. It submitted that his Honour did not explain how the respondent would be able to maintain fulltime employment until retirement age at 67, but thereafter would not be able to engage in part-time employment of a similar kind.

83The relevant part of his Honour's judgment was:

""151The parties were in dispute as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to damages for future loss of earning capacity. The parties are agreed he is likely to remain with his present employer on full salary entitlements until he retires. His retirement age is likely to be 67. However, it may be open to him to retire before that time. In any event even after retirement it is not unusual for teachers to place their names on casual staff lists - at both public and private schools. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he has lost earning capacity because of the incapacities I have referred to above. His life expectancy is close to 28 years. His working life would not be as much as that. I accept the plaintiff's submission that the most appropriate means of compensation for loss of earning capacity is to provide a cushion of $10,000 again that head of damage."" (Red 36O-T)

84The appellant did not dispute that s13 CLA allowed a cushion to be awarded. Its complaint was that there was no evidence to support an intention on the part of the respondent to work beyond retirement age and that there was no explanation of why such part-time work would be foreclosed to him.

85The relevant principle was stated by the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) in Husher v Husher [1999] HCA 47; 197 CLR 138 at [7]:

""Since at least Graham v Baker it has been recognised that it is convenient to assess an injured plaintiff's economic loss ""by reference to the actual loss of wages which occurs up to the time of trial and which can be more or less precisely ascertained and then, having regard to the plaintiff's proved condition at the time of trial, to attempt some assessment of his future loss"". But damages for both past loss and future loss are allowed to an injured plaintiff ""because the diminution of his earning capacity is or may be productive of financial loss"". Both elements are important. It is necessary to identify both what capacity has been lost and what economic consequences will probably flow from that loss. Only then will it be possible to assess what sum will put the plaintiff in the same position as he or she would have been in if injury had not been sustained.""

86In this case, it is clear that the respondent has lost capacity in that his ability to ambulate, carry weights, run and play sports is reduced. What has not been established is that given his occupation as a school teacher, that incapacity would have been productive of economic loss, in particular after his retirement at age 67. 

87This ground of appeal has been made out.

Conclusion

88It follows that the appellant has failed in its challenge to his Honour's findings as to liability but has succeeded in its challenge to one of the heads of damage. Although the appellant has succeeded on that issue, all but a very small part of the appeal was directed to the finding of liability in favour of the respondent. In those circumstances, the respondent should have his costs of the appeal.

89The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1)The appeal is allowed in part.

(2)His Honour's judgment in favour of the respondent in the sum of $223,381.58 is set aside.

(3)In lieu thereof, judgment is entered in favour of the respondent in the sum of $213,381.58.

(4)Otherwise, the orders made by his Honour on 19 January 2012 are confirmed.

(5)The appellant is to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.

90TOBIAS AJA: I agree with Hoeben JA.

1HOEBEN JA:   I agree with Beech-Jones J and the orders which he proposes.

2JOHNSON J:   I agree with Beech-Jones J.

3BEECH-JONES J:   This is an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed by the District Court. 

4On 28 June 2011 a jury found the applicant guilty of counts 1, 2 and 4 of a five count indictment. Count 1 charged the applicant with an offence under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900 of administering to his victim an intoxicating substance, namely Alprazolam, with the intention of enabling him to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual assault.

5Count 2 charged the applicant with an offence under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act of having sexual intercourse with his victim without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was a person under the age of sixteen years. His victim was fourteen years old. 

6Count 4 charged the applicant with another offence under s 61J(1). As I will explain, it involved the same victim and arose out of the same circumstances.

7Counts 3 and 5 of the indictment were in the alternative to counts 2 and 4. They need not be considered further. 

8In respect of count 1 his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a period of seven years commencing 11 February 2010 and expiring 10 February 2017. In respect of count 2, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years consisting of a non-parole period of seven years and six months commencing on 11 February 2013 and expiring on 10 August 2020 with a balance of term of two years and six months. In respect of count 4, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve years comprised of a non-parole period of eight years commencing 11 February 2014 and expiring on 10 February 2022 and a balance of term of four years.

9The combined effect of the three sentences was that the applicant received an accumulated non-parole period of twelve years commencing 11 February 2010 and expiring 10 February 2022 and a balance of term of four years expiring on 10 February 2026.

The offences

10The following description of the events and circumstances surrounding the offence is taken from his Honour's judgment. Subject to one matter which is the subject of ground 3 and to which I will return, there was no dispute concerning the facts.

11After finishing school on 4 November 2008 the victim went to Manly Wharf to meet up with some friends. She arrived sometime between 4pm and 6pm. After meeting her friends, she consumed some wine. At approximately 9.30pm she and a friend went to a fast food restaurant. While outside, she became involved in an argument between a young man and a young female, neither of whom the victim knew. A scuffle occurred and one or other or both of them struck the victim.

12At this point the applicant (then aged thirty-four years) who was also near the Manly Wharf, intervened. He did not know the victim. He pulled the young man from the victim and fought with him. 

13After the fight ended, the victim and the applicant began to talk. They decided they would look for the male and female involved in the fight, but were unsuccessful. They sat down near the wharf and continued talking and consuming wine. At some point there was a discussion about the pill ""Xanax"" (Aprazolam) and the applicant offered her a tablet. According to his Honour, the applicant told the victim words to the effect that it would ""get her more aggravated for a fight"". The victim consumed half a tablet. As she felt it was not having any effect she consumed the remainder. Some time later she consumed another tablet provided by the applicant. She continued to consume wine. The applicant topped up the victim's drink about four or five times during the evening. There was a dispute about whether the applicant had surreptitiously slipped the victim a further Xanax tablet into her drink, to which I will return. The provision of the Xanax tablets to the applicant was the conduct the subject of count 1 on the indictment.

14At some point the applicant started to feel dizzy. She left the group and located a bathroom. On her way back from the bathroom she walked into a fast food restaurant and drank some water. She returned to where she was last seated but could not find her friends or the applicant. By this time it was past 11.30pm.

15The victim then walked towards the bus stop and saw the applicant. The applicant asked the victim to go back to his place. He told her that he had ""pot and pills back at his house"". They hailed a taxi. Shortly after arriving at the applicant's home the victim passed out on a couch.

16The victim's next recollection was waking up naked with the applicant in his bed. She had no recollection of how she came to be in the bedroom or how her clothes were removed. She recalled waking up three or four times during the night but could not recall the exact sequence of events.

17On one occasion she woke to find the applicant performing cunnilingus upon her. This conduct constituted count 2 of the indictment.

18She drifted back to sleep and later awoke to find the applicant on top of her with his penis in her vagina. This conduct constituted count 4 of the indictment. She also recalls waking up at one point when the offender was licking her left breast and another when he was kissing her on the mouth.

19According to his Honour, the victim described ""these episodes as waking up and then falling back to sleep again, as if she was passing out"". His Honour said that the victim ""felt that she was unable to move or speak"" and noted that she had stated in her interview ""I was too out of it, and I couldn't really say, like, anything"".

20The victim woke up in the afternoon of the following day still naked and in the applicant's bed. She could not find her clothes or mobile telephone. The applicant gave her some clothes. She dressed and left. She took the Xanax bottle, which she later gave to the police. She walked to Manly wharf. Eventually she made a telephone call to her father from a public phone box. He collected her. He had been attempting to contact her since the previous evening. According to his Honour, her father described the victim as affected by ""something or other"". Her speech was slurred. Although he could not smell alcohol, he ""perceived that there was something 'wrong' with her"".

21When she arrived home the victim went straight to bed. She slept the whole night and woke up the next morning. That morning her sister observed that the victim looked as if she had been crying. She asked the victim why she was upset and the victim told her what had happened the night before. They contacted a youth worker and a complaint was made to the police. A limited examination was carried out at Royal North Shore Hospital. A urine sample revealed the presence of Alprazolam. 

22Xanax is the brand name for Alprazolam. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine which is prescribed to treat anxiety disorders and panic attacks. Common side effects of the drug are drowsiness, sedation, and lack of co-ordination. The sedating effects can impair cognition, consciousness and awareness, and result in retrograde amnesia. Alcohol exacerbates the common side effects of Alprazolam. The ingestion of alcohol and Alprazolam can severely compromise the ability to repel any unwanted sexual advances.

23The applicant has been prescribed Xanax since 10 July 2008. His Honour stated that he had received a prescription for Xanax ""on 4 November 2009"" and the prescription had been filled on the same day at a Manly pharmacy. This appears to be a typographical error. Presumably it was meant to be a reference to 4 November 2008.

The Sentencing Judgment

24I note eight points concerning his Honour's judgment.

25First, his Honour characterised the circumstances surrounding the first count as ""very serious"". His Honour found that the applicant knew the effect that Xanax was likely to have on the victim, but he had told her it would have the opposite effect. Thus, his Honour's findings and the jury's verdict amount to a conclusion that the applicant induced the victim to take the Xanax tablets by lying about their effect for the purpose of sexually assaulting her. His Honour found that the victim was ""immature and foolish"" and that the applicant took advantage of that in order to commit an offence ""upon a person who is half his age"". Not surprisingly, his Honour found that specific and general deterrence, as well as retribution, deserved significant weight in sentencing for count 1.

26Second, his Honour also described the circumstances surrounding both aggravated sexual assaults as serious. His Honour characterised the offence involving cunnilingus as falling slightly ""below the midrange of objective seriousness for such offences"" and the offence involving penile penetration at the ""mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences"". His Honour noted that no violence was involved in the offences, that both offences were opportunistic with no significant planning involved and that, based on the recollection of the complainant, they were ""not of long duration"". In my view little weight should be given to this latter conclusion given the drugged state of the victim and the fact that she slipped in and out of consciousness during the night she spent in the applicant's bed.

27Third, his Honour described the applicant's subjective circumstances. At the time of sentencing he was thirty-six years of age. He had left school during year 12. By the age of seventeen or eighteen he was consuming a large quantity of drugs. He had held a number of manual jobs for theatres and TV shows building sets and stages on a casual and full time basis. Although not referred to by his Honour, the testimonials from his family indicated that his upbringing was severely disrupted in his early teen years when his mother, who had the care of him, developed paranoid schizophrenia, as did his older brother shortly afterwards.

28Fifth, his Honour referred to an extract from a psychologist's report which detailed a history of illicit substance abuse from his late teens. A testimonial from his father stated that his abuse of drugs had commenced prior to then.

29Sixth, his Honour also referred to the psychologist's report as describing him as having suffered from ""anxiety for a number of years"" for which he had been prescribed medications (including Xanax). The psychologist's report referred to him as having an anxiety disorder.

30Seventh his Honour described the applicant's antecedents as not assisting him. His Honour noted that he had served gaol time for a number of offences including driving furiously, drive while disqualified, intimidating a police officer, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and break and enter. However his Honour also noted that the applicant had not been convicted for any offences as serious as those the subject of this application. None of his antecedents were sexual offences.

31Eighth, there was uncertainty about the total sentence that his Honour considered to be appropriate for count 1. At one point in his Honour's judgment he stated that the ""appropriate sentence"" was seven years and he would ""not set a parole period as it would be subsumed in the overall sentence that I intend to impose"". Later his Honour said that he did not set a parole period for this offence ""because it is subsumed in the total term I intend to impose"". These passages appear to suggest that his Honour considered that seven years represented an appropriate total sentence, i.e. a combination of what would otherwise be a non-parole period and an additional term.

32However, in imposing sentence his Honour stated that he sentenced the applicant ""to a period of non-parole of seven years to date from 11 February 2010 and conclude on 10 February 2017"". As his Honour did not specify an additional term, his Honour effectively imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for seven years. Based on this, I understand that his Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis that the appropriate sentence for count 1 was a non-parole period of seven years, and an additional term which need not be specified as it would be subsumed into the sentences on counts 2 and 4. It was most likely meant to reflect the ratio referred to in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act"") (75%). If that were the case, the balance of the additional term would be two years and four months.

New ground three - erroneous basis for sentencing on count 1

33At the hearing of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the applicant, Ms Davenport SC, sought and was granted leave to add an additional ground of appeal which alleged that, in sentencing the applicant on count 1, his Honour erred in taking into account that the applicant had ""without her knowledge spiked one of the complainant's drinks"". It is convenient to consider this ground first.

34Ms Davenport SC submitted that his Honour did not accept one part of the victim's evidence in which she alleged that the applicant had surreptitiously placed a further Xanax tablet in her wine, but nevertheless sentenced him on the basis that that aggravating fact was established. 

35In recounting the evidence given at the trial concerning the circumstances of the offences, his Honour stated:
""There was evidence from the complainant that when the offender topped up the complainant's last cup of alcohol, he slipped a further Xanax tablet into the complainant's drink. That drink was given to the complainant, the cup was filled to the top, and the complainant was unaware of what the offender had done.

The evidence was that when the complainant began to drink the wine, she saw a whole pill at the bottom of the cup. The complainant described the pill as white and she saw bubbles around its surface; she immediately discarded the drink and dissolving tablet. 

However, I do not find that those facts are proved beyond reasonable doubt, because of the evidence of Dr Allender, called by the Crown, and also the evidence of Professor Starmer, both gave evidence in relation to the rapid disintegration of Xanax. Professor Starmer conducted an experiment in relation to a tablet of Xanax, placing it in a glass of wine; and he gave evidence that the tablet began to disintegrate almost immediately, within about ten seconds."" (emphasis added)

36Later in the sentencing judgment, when his Honour was characterising the applicant's conduct in relation to count 1, his Honour stated:
""The offender, after giving the complainant a tablet, without her knowledge spiked one of the complainant's drinks, which he was topping up with alcohol, with a second tablet which when observed at the bottom of the glass, the complainant did not consume. The purpose of the offender giving the tablets to the complainant was for the tablet to produce the effect it had on the complainant so the offender was able to sexually assault the girl of fourteen."" (emphasis added)

37In my view, Ms Davenport SC's complaint has been made good. His Honour did not accept so much of the victim's evidence that suggested that the applicant slipped a further Xanax tablet into her drink without her knowledge. However, his Honour erroneously sentenced the applicant on the basis that he had so found, i.e. that the applicant had ""spiked"" one of her drinks. 

38Further, I consider that this mistake was material in the overall assessment of the seriousness of the applicant's conduct. On the facts that were found by his Honour, the applicant supplied two Xanax tablets to the victim which she knowingly consumed, but only after the applicant had lied to her about their effect. This conduct was undeniably reprehensible. However, to sentence the applicant on the basis that, in addition to that conduct, he had surreptitiously placed a further tablet in her drink without her knowledge was to act on a version of the facts that was even more serious than that which the facts properly found suggested. In my view this constitutes an error that warrants a reconsideration of the applicant's sentence on this count.

39I would uphold ground 3.

Ground 1 - Counts 2 and 4 - Muldrock error

40The Table in Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Act specifies a standard non-parole period of ten years for offences under s 61J of the Crimes Act. Ground 2 of the appeal contends that, in sentencing the applicant on counts 2 and 4, his Honour erred in attaching to the standard non-parole period for those offences a significance that the statutory scheme does not justify. 

41At the time of the sentence hearing, his Honour was bound to apply Division 1A in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. His Honour specifically referred to the decision in Way in his sentencing judgment. The decision in Way was also applied by this Court in subsequent judgments including R v Muldrock [2010] NSWCCA 106. That judgment was successfully appealed in the High Court: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

42In Muldrock the High Court found, inter alia, that this Court's decision in Muldrock had reflected the analysis of Division 1A of Part 4 in R v Way and that, in this respect, Way was wrongly decided:
""25   ... It follows from that acceptance that Way was wrongly decided. As will appear, it was an error to characterise s 54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms. The Court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed on assessment of whether the offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness.

...

28.   Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the Court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with the hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period."" (emphasis added)

43Ms Davenport SC contended that his Honour erroneously adopted the approach endorsed by Way but disapproved of by the High Court in Muldrock. In effect she submitted that his Honour adopted a two stage approach to sentencing that commenced by ""asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period"" and then considering what answer to that question was warranted by a consideration of the factors relevant to sentencing. 

44The Crown resisted this submission. It submitted that merely referring to Way in a sentencing judgment did not of itself convey error. The Crown relied on the following statement in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26] per Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed):
""Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases when an applicant is found guilty by a jury with the result that the sentencing judge will consider that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors could be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guide or yardstick."" (emphasis added)

45I have already noted that his Honour cited this Court's decision in Way. In the sentencing judgment, his Honour cited Way and described the process to be adopted as follows:
""In relation to the two sexual assault matters, I am bound by the standard non-parole periods, there being verdicts after trial ...

Each s 61J offence carries a standard non-parole of ten years. R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 mandates that for each of the sexual assault offences, I must ask the question, 'are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?' which is answered by considering the objective seriousness of the offence, which I did earlier in these remarks, and the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation set out in s 21A, which I have also done.

I now have to consider the just and appropriate sentence to impose, having regard to all circumstances of the offender; and the circumstances of the offence which I have set out earlier."" (emphasis added)

46Merely because his Honour stated that he was ""bound"" by the standard non-parole periods is not suggestive of error. The standard non parole periods form part of the relevant legislative scheme and, in that sense, they are binding on all the courts to whom the legislation is directed. However, in my view his Honour did err by his Honour asking whether ""there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period"". It was precisely that approach that was disapproved by the High Court in Muldrock at [25]. Adopting the phraseology of Davies J in Butler at [26] in this case, after a jury verdict, his Honour approached the matter on the basis that ""the standard non-parole period [was] mandatory unless factors could be found to justify a variation from it"".

47The Crown pointed to the last paragraph of the extract set out in [45] as indicating that his Honour applied an instinctive synthesis approach, as opposed to a two stage approach to sentencing (see Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] to [56], per McHugh J). I disagree. When read with the paragraph that immediately precedes it, it is clear that his Honour did not merely refer to the standard non-parole period as ""simply a guideline or yardstick"", but instead commenced with the standard non-parole period and then sought to find factors which, to quote Davies J in Butler, could ""justify a variation from it"". His Honour's consideration of ""all the circumstances"" was undertaken in that context.

48It follows that I would uphold ground 1 of the appeal.

Ground 2 - Manifestly Excessive

49Ground 2 of the appeal alleges that both the individual sentences for the three offences and their combined effect were manifestly excessive. Given that I have already found that there was invalidating error with each of the three sentences it is not necessary to consider this ground. I address below the appropriate sentence that I consider the applicant's conduct and circumstances justifies. It suffices to state that I consider that a different sentence is warranted (cf s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). Further in my view, at the very least the total combined sentence comprising a twelve year minimum term and an additional term of four years was manifestly excessive. The applicant's conduct was obviously reprehensible but having regard to the total criminality involved a sentence of sixteen years is likely to have an unduly crushing effect on the applicant.

Revised Sentence 

50At the hearing of the appeal, Ms Davenport SC read an affidavit from the applicant which was sought to be relied upon if the Court proposed to re-sentence. No objection was taken to the affidavit by the Crown. In his affidavit the applicant describes his ongoing struggle with his anxiety disorder. He describes his difficulties in obtaining psychiatric or psychological help in custody. He states that he is attempting to address his anxiety without the use of medication. He states that he has the ongoing support of his family. He does not address his offending conduct. His affidavit does not advance matters much beyond the position considered by his Honour. His difficulties in dealing with anxiety in custody were anticipated at that time.

51I have described the circumstances surrounding count 1 above. He was prescribed with Xanax that very day and had his own legitimate use for the drug. The opportunity for the applicant to meet the victim arose out of a random confrontation with other strangers that she became engaged in. At some point after the applicant provided her with Xanax (Alprazolam) he left her and apparently sought to take the bus home before they met up again. These considerations suggest that his administration of the drug to her was not part of some previously determined plan or modus operandi that was put into effect that evening.

52Nevertheless, a jury found that a 34 year old man drugged a 14 year old girl with the intention of sexually assaulting her and then carried through with that intention. Such conduct demands a heavy sentence. The applicant's antecedents do not include any sexual offences but they are otherwise of not much assistance to him. His difficulties with anxiety have been discussed. It was not suggested that they have any connection with his offending conduct and they do not otherwise weigh much in his favour when considered against the seriousness of the conduct that he engaged in. 

53One matter that needs to be borne in mind in fixing the sentences for these offences is the age of the victim. It was an element of the offences for which he was convicted for counts 2 and 4. This does not preclude it from being considered a circumstance of aggravation of count 1. However, it reinforces that considerations of totality need to be carefully considered in determining cumulation and concurrency for the offences in this case.

54For count 1, I consider that a fixed term sentence of five years imprisonment is appropriate. I do not propose that a non-parole period be fixed, as it would in any event be subsumed in the sentences that I propose for counts 2 and 4. This sentence equates to an overall sentence of six years and eight months for this offence (see Ruttley v R [2010] NSWCCA 118 at [43] per Simpson J, McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing).

55For counts 2 and 4, and bearing in mind the commencing guidance derived from the standard non-parole of ten years, I propose that the applicant be sentenced to a term of eight years imprisonment for each offence. Subject to what follows, that would ordinarily translate to a non-parole period of six years and an additional term of two years each.

56It is not appropriate that there be complete concurrency with all of these sentences. If that were to occur then there would be no effective separate penalty for the administration of the drug to the victim. I consider it appropriate that the sentence for count 4 commence two years after the sentence for count 1. Further, although they were part of the same course of conduct, the starting dates for counts 2 and 4 should be staggered by a year to reflect the separate criminality involved. Accordingly, the commencing date for the sentence for count 2 will start one year after the commencing date for count 4. However the non-parole period for count 2 will be reduced under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act to ensure that the ratio of the balance of term to the combined non-parole period better approximates to the statutory ratio referred to in that provision (see R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139 at [37] to [39]).

57The effect of all the sentences that I propose is that the applicant receives a combined non-parole period of eight years expiring 10 February 2018 and an additional term of three years, expiring 10 February 2021.

58Accordingly I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal be granted.

(2)Appeal allowed.

(3)Set aside each of the sentences imposed by the District Court on 11 March 2011 and, in lieu thereof, sentence the applicant as follows:

(a)for the offence under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900 to a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing 11 February 2010 and expiring 10 February 2015;

(b)for the offence under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 comprising count 4 on the indictment to a term of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 11 February 2012 and expiring 10 February 2018 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing 11 February 2018 and expiring on 10 February 2020;

(c)for the offence under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 comprising count 2 on the indictment to a term of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 11 February 2013 and expiring 10 February 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing 11 February 2018 and expiring on 10 February 2021.

2760357,Coregas Pty Limited v Penford Australia Pty Limited [2012] NSWCA 350,"JUDGMENT

1MEAGHER JA: I agree for the reasons given by Hoeben JA that the orders his Honour proposes should be made.

2HOEBEN JA:
Nature of appeal
During 2005, the appellant (Coregas Pty Ltd) supplied hydrogen chloride gas in cylinders to the respondent (Penford Australia Pty Ltd). The cylinders were delivered in a cage, one side of which operated as a ramp. On 25 October 2005 Anthony Spence, an employee of the respondent, was injured while using such a ramp to unload a gas cylinder. The employee brought proceedings against the respondent in negligence. Those proceedings were settled as between the respondent and the employee for $435,000, inclusive of costs, but clear of workers compensation payments. $469,641.27 was paid to the employee on 5 June 2008. 

3The respondent brought proceedings against the appellant for contribution and/or indemnity in respect of the $469,641.27, pursuant to s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW). The respondent was successful in those proceedings. Lakatos DCJ apportioned liability equally between the respondent and the appellant and entered judgment in favour of the respondent for 50 percent of the amount paid to the employee.

4The appellant has appealed from that judgment. 

5The respondent also brought proceedings pursuant to s 19 of the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) and for an indemnity pursuant to s 151Z(1)(d) of the Workers Compensation Act, 1987 (NSW). His Honour dismissed the claim under the Sale of Goods Act 1923. He suggested that the claim to an indemnity under s 151Z(1)(d) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 be dealt with consistently with his conclusion as to contribution. That claim was not addressed in the short minutes of order agreed by the parties and is not the subject of any relief sought by the notice of appeal.

Factual background

6With the exception of two matters, the parties were in agreement as to his Honour's findings of fact.

7The respondent's premises where the accident occurred operated as a dextrin plant. The process involved taking starch and by a chemical reaction, converting it into dextrin. Dextrin is a dry product which is used as an ingredient in the confectionary industry and as a flocculant in the mining industry to separate ore. The hydrochloric gas/liquid supplied by the appellant was injected into a dextrin reactor and blended with the product.

8The reactors in the plant were supplied by a German company and the gas installation was set up by a predecessor to the appellant. The gas installation comprised a mechanical connection through the building involving pipe work from gas cylinders to the dextrin reactors.

9The gas cylinders were stored in the cage in which they were delivered in an area outside the factory in the open air. This was done for safety reasons because they contained a dangerous toxin that needed ventilation. In due course, the cylinders were transferred from that location to another open area which had a roof over it on the outside of the building. It was there that the cylinders were connected to the pipe work. 

10The agreement for the supply of gas by the appellant to the respondent was in evidence (Blue 2). In that agreement, the appellant undertook to:

""Supply materials and services to specification subject to agreed lead times.""

11The appellant called no oral evidence. Mr Segerius, the Operations Manager of the respondent in 2005, gave this evidence. 

""Q. Does that help you to recall that when you inspected the area shortly after the accident, you observed that the cages were marked with the brand name ""BASF""?
A. Yes.

Q. And the gas bottles were similarly marked?
A. Yes.

Q. May I have that document back please. And to your knowledge BASF was the manufacturer of the gas that you used, is that so?
A. I don't know.

Q. Do the cages as they now present themselves ---

...

Q. Do they have a BASF marking on them or not?
A. I don't know."" (Blue 39D-N)

12On the basis of that evidence, the trial judge was asked to infer that the appellant did not manufacture the gas and did not manufacture the cages, but that both these items were manufactured and provided to the appellant by another entity, BASF. There was no evidence as to the relationship between the appellant and BASF. While he was not prepared to draw that inference, his Honour approached the claim on the assumption that this proposition was correct.

13As indicated, the cylinders were delivered by the appellant to the respondent already loaded in a cage. There were usually two cages on a truck. The cages were taken from the truck by forklift to a designated area in the respondent's premises. Such designated areas were located in the open 10 to 15 metres from the plant on a concrete slab. There were 12 cylinders to a cage in three rows of four cylinders. Each cylinder was approximately 1.6 metres in height and weighed 125 kgs when full.

14Other than the Incident Report (Blue 21) which contained some black and white photocopies, there were no photographs of the cage from which Mr Spence (the worker) was removing a cylinder when he was injured. The parties implicitly accepted that photographs taken in 2009 by Dr Cooke, an expert retained on behalf of the respondent, depicted a cage similar to that involved in the accident. 

15Dr Cooke measured the floor of the cage at 140mm above ground. The front of the cage had a hinged flap made of steel chequerplate. That flap or ramp came in two lengths - 500mm and 695mm. The slope of the 500mm ramp was 28.6 percent (16 degrees) and that of the 695mm ramp 18.4 percent (11.7 degrees).

16At the time of the accident, the worker had been doing the job of unloading cylinders from such a cage for approximately four years. When he commenced that work, he had been given instruction by a supervisor as to the method to be used for removing cylinders from the cage. This method was: The front of the cage was opened and the ramp was lowered. The safety bar and the harness around the gas bottles were undone. The cylinders were then manoeuvred by hand down the ramp to a trolley, which was specifically designed for the movement of cylinders. The trolley base onto which the cylinder was placed had a wind-up mechanism so that it could be raised above ground level. Both the worker and Mr Segerius said that the wind-up mechanism was working in 2005 when the accident occurred.

17The worker described the circumstances of the accident as follows:

""Q. ... So the trolley is off to the side I think you said, you lower the ramp, and what happens next?
A. Undo the safety bar that goes across the front of the gas bottles and undo the harness that goes around the gas bottles, and then it is a matter of getting them down the ramp onto the ground so you can use the trolley.

Q. Well before I describe or ask you to describe how that occurs, can I ask you this, when a cage is full, do the cylinders come right up to the edge of the ramp?
A. Yes.

Q. Can you get your feet in there at all?
A. No.

Q. If you are removing the very first cylinder or the second one?
A. No it is too awkward.

Q. Why?
A. Because there's not enough room because you have to wriggle the bottle until you get it out from the others so then you can tilt it to roll it down the ramp.

Q. And this was the method taught to you by a Penford person?
A. Yes.

Q. Why wouldn't you just take the trolley up the ramp, Mr Spence?
A. It won't go up the ramp.

Q. Why?
A. Because you've got two straight bars, once it goes up then you're on a - because its got a back wheel and it will rock like that on the back.

Q. And there is a risk the thing will fall off?
A. Yes.

Q. All right, I got you to the point Mr Spence where you - I think you said shimmying, what happens next?
A. Shimmying, then you've got to slowly roll it down the platform onto the level ground.

...

Q. Are they heavy to manhandle?
A. Yes.

Q. Does it take all your strength?
A. It does take a bit of work to get them out.

Q. Can we presume from your answers that the first row are harder than the latter rows?
A. Yes."" (Black 16S - 17R)

""Q. It was a poor question Mr Spence I will ask it another way, was it a full cage that you were approaching?
A. Yes.

...

Q. You put how many - were both feet on the ramp?
A. Yes.

Q. You were fairly close to the cylinder?
A. Yes.

Q. Indeed because of its weight and how it is - how they come stacked, do you keep your body weight close to a cylinder to try and shimmy it?
A. Yes.

Q. What happened next?
A. I was shimmying the gas bottle out and then I had to take a step back so that once I got it out far enough, so I could tilt it to get it onto its edge to roll down the ramp, my back foot slipped which was my left foot, slipped and as I slipped the bottle come towards me, I got down on a knee and pushed the bottle to one side and that's when the accident happened."" (Black 19E - P)

18It was common ground that the ramp was wet at the time, either from dew or light rain. 

19The worker said that although the respondent provided ongoing safety training, he had missed it because such training occurred on his rostered days off. He said that he had reported problems concerning the use of the trolley to the respondent on one or two occasions, about two years after he started doing that work. This report of problems had been made at safety meetings, but the problem was not remedied. Neither the worker nor Mr Segerius were aware of any other accidents where someone had slipped on a ramp while unloading cylinders in the five years before the accident.

20Mr Segerius gave evidence that in recent times a change had occurred in cage construction. He said:

""Q. What is that change?
A. There is no longer a ramp on the cage.

Q. Did Penford remove the ramps?
A. No.

Q. Who did?
A. Coregas.

Q. Did you see men or women working on these cages to remove the ramps yourself?
A. No.

Q. Did any of your employees remove the ramps?
A. No.

Q. The cages are the property of Coregas are they not?
A. Correct.

HIS HONOUR: 

Q. Just so it is clear Mr Segerius, the position is that in recent times, whenever that was, when the cages were delivered, you observed that they had no ramps?
A. Yes they no longer have ramps now."" (Black 36T - 37H)

21There was an issue between the parties as to the extent to which the appellant had power to direct or specify where cylinders were to be positioned at the respondent's premises. The appellant submitted that while it had a power of approval, that power did not amount to a power to direct any specific location for the storage of the cylinders. Put another way, the appellant could veto a particular location but could not tell the respondent where or how to store the cylinders, other than to ensure that they were stored in circumstances where if any gas vented, it would vent into the atmosphere and not into an enclosed space.

22The relevant evidence was that of Mr Segerius:

""Q. Why were the cylinders kept outside and not indoors?
A. For safety reasons.

Q. Under whose recommendation was it that they be kept outside?
A. It would be the supplier.

Q. Who is that?
A. Coregas."" (Black 36A - D)

""Q. The location where the cages were to be delivered with the full gas bottles, that was a point selected by Penford within the yard?
A. It would have been selected by Penford in conjunction with Coregas.

Q. Were you party to any discussions in which that occurred?
A. No.

Q. So you're speculating in that respect?
A. We have a number of gas installations on site and they all have to be approved by the supplier before you can be supplied by gas.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Just so I'm clear on that answer, Mr Segerius when you talk about installations in this context what is it?
A. Installation where there is a gas bottle been installed and supplied by the supplier to meet the safety regulations that has to be installed in a certain way and has to have a certain clearance around it so a supplier won't supply gas unless it is correctly installed and we have other gasses on site and other positions on site for other things.

Q. When you refer to correctly installed, are we talking about the cages in this particular context, these facts both the location of the cages and where the bottles are taken to be hooked up to the pipes, both of those or?
A. Yes.

Q. Both of them?
A. Yes.

...

COUNSEL:

Q. And where they were stored on your site was outside?
A. Correct."" (Black 42L - 43G)

23I am satisfied on the basis of that evidence that the appellant played an active role in the positioning of the cages containing gas bottles on the respondent's premises. I agree, however, that what was exercised was a power of approval and/or veto, rather than a power to direct of its own motion, where gas bottles should be located. The impression I gained from that evidence is that such a decision was jointly made by the appellant and the respondent. What is clear from that evidence, however, is that the appellant would have known that gas cylinders were being stored at the respondent's premises in the open air and as such, were exposed to the elements.

24The second factual issue which was not agreed between the parties was whether the ramp on which the worker slipped was of the longer or shorter kind. Although the evidence is not clear on this issue, what is clear from an exchange between counsel for the parties and his Honour at Black 80F - N, is that at the trial both parties proceeded on the basis that the worker had slipped on the longer ramp. In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the appeal should proceed on that basis.

The expert evidence

25There was evidence from three experts - Mr Dohrmann and Dr Cooke (for the respondent) and Mr Horrigan (for the appellant). Only Dr Cooke was required for cross-examination. There was little, if any, disagreement between those experts.

26Mr Dohrmann was a professional consulting engineer, with expertise in slips and falls, who was commissioned by the worker to provide expert evidence in his claim against the respondent. The focus of his report of September 2007 was on the liability of the respondent. Mr Dohrmann did not inspect the respondent's premises nor a similar cage and ramp.

27Mr Dohrmann found that there was insufficient room on the ramp to use the supplied trolley and as a result, there was no option but that the worker manhandle the unstable, heavy metal cylinder down a slope. He considered that this task was made more difficult because the sloping metal surface was wet. He concluded that the worker slipped partly due to the lack of traction underfoot and partly due to the posture which he adopted while manhandling the cylinder. Mr Dohrmann characterised the system of work as ""a recipe for an accident"". (Blue 32W)

28Mr Dohrmann concluded that the respondent could have taken the following measures to prevent exposing the worker to such a risk of injury:

Carrying out a safety audit.

Providing effective training in safe lifting techniques.

Providing a wider platform at the front of the cage to enable a trolley to be used on the horizontal surface.

Providing a slip-resistant surface on the ramp.

Providing a roof over the cage and storing the bottles level with the ground on a concrete pad.

29In relation to the respondent's ""Incident Report"" (Blue 21) which asserted that ""it is standard practice around Australia to manhandle cylinders in this way"", Mr Dohrmann said:

""I would agree that the practice of rolling and manoeuvring gas cylinders onto flat platforms on trolleys (at ground level) is common; however, the practice of requiring people to manoeuvre a heavy cylinder down a wet (and assumed slippery) surface certainly is not, and ought not be regarded as ""standard practice""."" (Blue 39L - M)

30Dr Cooke was a consulting architect and a member of the Standards of Australia Sub-committee of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. He also was an expert on slips and falls. As indicated, he inspected cylinder cages at the respondent's site in June 2009 and conducted co-efficient of friction tests on a similar kind of ramp. His Honour was satisfied that the cage and ramp tested in 2009 by Dr Cooke were sufficiently similar to yield results which were indicative of slip resistance of the ramp involved in the accident in 2005 (Red 27G).

31Dr Cooke considered that Australian Standard AS1657-1992 was relevant in that it applied to ramps used in industrial situations. By reference to that standard, Dr Cooke tested the slip resistance of the chequerplate surface of a ramp by employing the test devices referred to in the standard. Although the standard indicated that highly profiled surfaces (such as steel chequerplate) might not be suitable for testing, Dr Cooke was of the opinion that it was possible to obtain a reliable reading on steel chequerplate under wet conditions provided care was taken to set up the slider so that it had a smooth passage across the surface of the raised profile.

32Under the Australian Standard, a minimum dynamic co-efficient of friction of .63 was required for ordinary pedestrian use of the longer ramp. The worst result obtained by Dr Cooke when measuring the co-efficient of friction of the longer ramp was 0.65. By reference to that test result, Dr Cooke concluded that ""the cages have not been designed to provide a safe ramp surface for unloading full cylinders. The chequerplate surface is not adequately slip resistant under wet conditions for the task of manoeuvring a full cylinder down the ramp"". (Blue 44F - G)

33The reasoning for Dr Cooke's opinion was that although the Australian Standard did not specifically apply, it provided a guide against which the slip resistance of the ramp could be assessed. This was because the specific use of the ramp in the present case was not an ordinary pedestrian use. It followed that although the tests produced an objective reading, the level of risk needed to be assessed by reference to the actual task. In this case that task involved the manual handling of a very heavy object by an employee, walking backwards down a ramp. Under wet conditions, there was a greater risk that an accident of this kind would occur.

34Dr Cooke was not cross-examined specifically as to this conclusion but on the basis that he could not accurately carry out a test for slip resistance on a heavily profiled surface such as the ramp. He was also cross-examined on the basis that his conclusion did not have adequate regard to the fact that there had been no accidents of this kind during the preceding five years. Dr Cooke did not accept those propositions.

35In relation to alternative systems, Dr Cooke said:

""I have found that, with the ramp propped up on blocks of wood to provide an approximately level surface it would have been possible to bring the base of the trolley into a position where it was underneath the outer edge of the raised flap ... with the trolley in that position it would have been possible to roll a cylinder to the edge of the horizontal flap and work it onto the trolley base.

The task would have been less hazardous than the task being performed by Mr Spence at the time of the accident because the flap would not have been steeply sloping. If appropriate fold out legs were fitted to the flap, it could be dropped down to provide a horizontal surface. Alternatively, blocks of wood or other supports of the correct height could have been used to make the flap into a horizontal surface. However, the ramp in that position (propped up to make a horizontal platform) would not have provided a completely safe working platform because of the need to manhandle the cylinders onto the trolley."" (Blue 51W - 52K)

36Mr Horrigan was an expert in engineering and ergonomics. When preparing his report, he had available the reports of the other two experts. The only difference between his opinion and that of Dr Cooke was that he had some reservations about the accuracy of using a pendulum tester to measure the co-efficient of friction of a profiled surface. Mr Horrigan said:

""Dr Cooke was able to inspect the ramp and conduct measurements. He also concludes that Mr Spence could have slipped on the ramp because his measurement of co-efficient of friction indicates that the shallow ramp is on the limit for possible slipping and the steep ramp requires a higher co-efficient of friction from that provided by the chequerplate surface. I also note that he has used a pendulum tester to obtain these values of co-efficient of friction even though it is unsuitable for profiled surfaces. Irrespective of the validity of these readings, it is probable that Mr Spence did indeed experience a slip leading to a loss of control of the cylinder rather than simply losing control of the cylinder."" (Blue 156N - Q)

37Otherwise the opinion of Mr Horrigan is in accord with that of Mr Dohrmann and Dr Cooke.

38Mr Horrigan set out the actions required to be performed by Mr Spence when removing a cylinder from the cage as follows:

""1. Lower the cage door.

2. Move up the ramp and place his right foot on the floor of the cage (this would only be easily achieved after at least one cylinder had been removed) retaining his left foot somewhere on the ramp.

3. Grasp the cylinder to be removed and tilt it toward him.

4. Roll the cylinder on its edge across the floor of the cage and down the ramp until it was on the concrete floor, making continual adjustments to grip on the cylinder, body posture and his foot position.

5. Continue to roll the cylinder across the concrete floor until it reached the lifter trolley."" (Blue 154H - L)

39Mr Horrigan commented on that system of work as follows:

""This method of rolling cylinders is an old method of moving gas cylinders. It was adopted as a method of moving gas cylinders which were traditionally supplied individually. The weight of the gas cylinders and the dearth of readily available commercial manual handling equipment encouraged this rolling method. The use of caged pallets for gas cylinders began in the late 1960's. The pallet cages usually have incorporated ramps and/or platforms to allow the removal of cylinders using the ""rolling"" method. The floor of the cage is normally above the level of the factory floor due to the requirement for space underneath to accommodate forklift tines. 

...

The ""rolling"" method does involve a specific skill which has to be learned and practised.

...

When a person is skilled in using this ""rolling"" method they can usually control the movement of the cylinder on a hard level surface because their posture is reasonably stable. However, there still remains a risk of a loss of control and therefore a risk of injury and damage.

When the employee tries to use this method on a slippery ramp, there is an increased risk of loss of control. This relates to the principal of three points of contact onto rigid supports. ... In the situation of accessing the cylinder up the ramp, to have three points of support it is necessary to hold onto the cage with two hands, while placing one foot on the ramp when moving the second foot onto the cage floor. However, even with two feet in a stable position, it is impossible to maintain three points of contact because two hands are required to ""roll"" the cylinder down the ramp. If a foot slips there is less chance of recovery. This is why this method of moving the cylinder from the cage down a wet ramp is inherently unstable and undesirable.

This Incident Report by Mr Bailey indicates that there had been no incidents of that nature in the last five years. This implies that the workers had been able to use the method for five years without losing control, or had lost control but had not been able to regain control without causing damage or loss, or had lost control but had not reported the incident. They had at least been able to use the method for five years without causing a serious injury. ...

The nature of hazards and risk is such that an inherently risky activity such as the work method used by Mr Spence can be undertaken for an extended period without the injury scenario occurring. ... Moving a 125 kg object using an inherently unstable method should have triggered a review and risk assessment of that method. ... The obvious factor raised in all reports was the ramp was wet and therefore more slippery."" (Blue 154 - 155)

40In relation to the alternative suggested by Dr Cooke, Mr Horrigan said:

""A level surface is always more preferable than a ramp. I note Dr Cooke suggested using drop down feet to ""automatically"" ensure the ramp became a level surface. Properly designed, maintained and used, this would provide a stable and more level surface. The lifter trolley would be able to be slipped under the level surface and the cylinder rolled to the lifter trolley. There is still a need to ensure the cylinder was upright and stable before the worker stepped off the edge of the level surface (if necessary, if they became cramped for space) but the chance of maintaining control would be better. It would of course be necessary for the worker to ensure the drop down feet/legs had deployed correctly because a collapse of one leg could also create instability.

Dr Cooke also suggested chocks under the ramp could be used to bring it up to a more level surface. This too will work. It does rely on the worker actually using the chocks and positioning them correctly to ensure the legs of the lifter trolley would slide under the level surface. It would require the chocks to be stored nearby and off the floor to avoid a tripping hazard."" (Blue 158S - 159E)

41Mr Horrigan concluded with the observation that by continuing with the work method which involved rolling the cylinder down a ramp, the respondent allowed an inherently unstable activity to continue. He thought that the wet surface contributed to the occurrence of the accident and suggested that the area could have been roofed.

42Reference has already been made to the Incident Report by the respondent, dated 31 October 2005. This report was compiled by a Mr Stuart Bailey. There was no evidence of Mr Bailey's qualifications which enabled him to complete this report. It can, however, be inferred that he must have had some qualifications and/or experience, otherwise there would have been little point in the respondent having him compile such a report.

43Under the heading ""Risk Rating"" the risk was rated ""3 out of 5 - Substantial risk"". Relevant ""factors"" were recorded as follows:

""1. This is the only incident of this nature to have occurred in the last five years.

2. The design of the pallet and ramp do not allow the lifter to access the cylinders on the pallet.

3. It is standard practice throughout Australia to manhandle cylinders in this way.

4. The chequerplate ramp was damp with dew.

5. [The worker's] stance was too wide with his left foot at an angle on the ramp.

6. Bottle weight of approximately 125 kg when full.""

In relation to ""Actions"", the following was set out:

""Short term: 

1. Trial the use of anti-slip matting on the pallet ramps.

2. Assess and train operators in gas cylinder handling.

Medium term:

1. The company supplying the cylinders has been contacted on alternative handling methods - awaiting reply.

2. Materials Handling Equipment Company is designing a machine to lift the cylinders off the pallet - awaiting pricing.
Note: A number of designs have been trialled over the years with none proving successful.""

44The tender of Dr Cooke's report was objected to at trial. The appellant submitted that its tender should be rejected, or it should be given little weight, because it involved theoretical testing conducted four years after the accident on a ramp not established to be the one on which the accident occurred.

45The appellant submitted that the variety of results indicated that the testing was not precise and that there was no evidence that Dr Cooke tested the exact spot where the worker placed his foot immediately before the accident.

46His Honour allowed the tender of the report because it was relied upon to show that a substantially similar ramp (such as confronted the worker in 2005) was unsafe for the task of manhandling a 125 kg cylinder to ground level. His Honour noted that apart from commenting upon the potential invalidity of the testing by Dr Cooke, Mr Horrigan substantially agreed with his approach and conclusion.

Liability findings at trial
Duty of care

47Although the contest was between the respondent and the appellant, the parties appreciated that for the respondent to succeed it had to establish that the appellant was a party who, if sued by the worker, would have been found liable to the worker as a ""tortfeasor liable in respect of"" his injury (Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946,
s 5(1)(c). In other words, for the respondent to succeed it had to establish that the appellant owed a duty of care to the worker, that the duty had been breached and that the breach of duty caused the worker's injury.

48At trial, and on appeal, the appellant denied that it owed any duty of care to the worker. It submitted that it merely supplied gas cylinders to the respondent under a contract and provided a receptacle in which those cylinders could be stored. It submitted that this occurred in a work environment where the respondent had a non-delegable obligation to exercise reasonable care for the safety of the worker. It was no responsibility of the appellant to design a safe system of work for employees of the respondent. Because the cylinders and cages were branded ""BASF"", the appellant submitted that it was to be treated as a non-manufacturing distributor of goods and, in that regard, the principles set out in McPherson's Limited v Eaton and Ors [2005] NSWCA 435; 65 NSWLR 187 had application.

49In reaching his decision, his Honour relied upon Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd [2011] HCA 11; 243 CLR 361. In particular, his Honour rejected the implicit submission that just because the respondent, as the worker's employer, had a non-delegable duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of the worker, this excluded a duty of care being owed by another party.

50His Honour's findings as to the existence of a duty of care, owed by the appellant to the worker, are at Red 39C - S as follows:

""85 An examination of the salient features of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant discloses that the defendant by contract, was responsible for ""the provision of compressed gases for the Dextrin plant ... and industrial maintenance gases ... including ... HCL"" to the plaintiff in the form of heavy gas bottles in a cage with an attached ramp. I am prepared to assume that the defendant did not itself construct the cage and the ramp. It nevertheless agreed to ""supply materials and services to specification"" and was responsible for approving the location of the cage outside - hence it knew or ought to have known that the cage and ramp would be subject to the weather conditions.

86 The defendant would be taken to be aware of the dimensions of the cage and ramp and the gas cylinders including that the bottles weighed approximately 125 kg when full, the limited horizontal area for a worker to stand when attempting to remove cylinders in the first row, and that individual workers working alone, would be required to move full cylinders by negotiating the chequerplate metal ramp. The defendant would also be taken to know that the task was likely to be a repetitive task, performed in a diminishing space (as to which there is evidence) and to have been attended by inadvertence (as to which there is a reasonable inference given the worker had undertaken the task on a regular basis over some years) cf Czatyrko v Edith Cowan University.

87 I conclude that the defendant did owe [the worker] a duty of care to take reasonable steps to supply a cage and ramp for its gas cylinders, which would not subject foreseeable users to the unreasonable risk of injury whilst moving the gas cylinders cf Kuhl at [27].""

Breach of duty and causation

51His Honour appreciated that a finding of breach of duty required more than proof that a particular preventative measure was reasonably practicable. His Honour said:

""It must be shown that a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have foreseen that his or her conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff before determining what a reasonable person would have done in response to the risk."" (Red 40L - O)

52In relation to breach, his Honour said:

""94 In my view, a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have realised that moisture in combination with the slope of the ramp and the need for a worker to physically manoeuvre the heavy cylinder down the ramp, would have made the worker susceptible to slipping and consequently to be injured. Such a person would also have realised that should a worker slip and fall, the risk of injury resulting from the impact of a heavy gas cylinder would be high and any injury, potentially serious.

95 The experts variously stated that the situation was a recipe for an accident; the ramp was inadequately slip-resistant and that there were increased chances of slipping on a wet surface when combined with an inherently unstable method of moving the cylinders. Neither Dr Cooke nor Mr Horrigan was persuaded that the absence of reported accidents in the previous years invalidated that opinion. Mr Horrigan offered a number of explanations which might account for the absence of complaint, which in my view, accord with common sense. In my opinion, the risk of injury was not insignificant cf s 5B(1) of Civil Liability Act 2002.

96 A reasonable person in the defendant's position would have recognised that serious injuries might occur to a worker if he slipped and fell whilst handling a heavy cylinder. Because the defendant distributed the cylinders in the cage and required that the cage be kept outside, the burden of taking precautions fell partly on it (and on the plaintiff) cf s 5B(2) of Civil Liability Act. A reasonable person in the defendant's position would have advised the employer to have taken steps to make the ramp horizontal by way of advising that chocks be used, or by itself inserting fold out legs in response to the risk."" (Red 41Q - 42L)

53In relation to whether these responses were reasonable and as to causation, his Honour said:

""101 The alternatives suggested by Dr Cooke were the use of chocks or the use of fold out legs to reduce or eliminate the slope of the ramp. There was a measure of agreement between experts. The suggestions involved no apparent complexity or sophistication; where the opinions do not offend commonsense and appear feasible that in my view, is a sufficient basis to conclude that the measures are reasonably practicable, especially in the context where no evidence pointing to lack of practicability, has been adduced by the defendant.

102 The defendant argued that the measures suggested by Dr Cooke were not demonstrated by him, to be feasible or cost-effective. It argued that, unless there was proper testing and costing, those opinions lacked sufficient validity to be persuasive. The defendant did not adduce evidence on this issue, although it had or had access to ""knowledge of the nature, cost and practical consequences"" of the suggested alternatives cf Nelson v John Lysaght (Australia) Ltd. 

103 I remain unconvinced that in this context a lack of costing is significant; the efficacy is adverted to by experts. The argument relating to lack of testing, may have force, if the measures recommended, were sophisticated and involved significant research and development. On their face, the suggestions of Dr Cooke do not fit that description. The use of chocks and/or legs on the ramp, to enable the ramp to be level, do not appear to be highly sophisticated or difficult matters to achieve. I am fortified in that view by the agreement of the defence expert, Mr Horrigan, to the efficacy of the measures. I would have expected that if there were significant cost and/or difficulties in implementing these measures, Mr Horrigan would have pointed those out. This is especially so given Mr Horrigan was alive to the need to consider any measures in the light of any consequential changes to the system of storing, transporting and moving the gas cylinders in cages and ramps.

104 In the circumstances, I consider that it was reasonably open to the defendant to cause these measures to be implemented. In my view, if it had done so, the risk of injury to any worker, moving gas cylinders would have been reduced. This would have been achieved by the reduction of any slope on the ramp and by permitting easier access of a trolley to the lip of the ramp. These measures, of course, would not eliminate all risks, because a worker would still be required to manhandle the gas cylinder from the cage, across a level chequerplate ramp and lower it into a trolley some 15 cm below the level of the ramp."" (Red 43L - 44P)

54Having found liability established in favour of the respondent, his Honour then dealt with the question of apportionment. In approaching that question, his Honour set out the relevant principles and then proceeded to apply them to the facts of the matter before him.

""109 The question of apportionment of responsibility between joint tortfeasors involves a finding upon a question of proportion, of balance and relative emphasis, and of weighing different considerations. It involves a choice or discretion as to which there may be differences of opinion by different minds. Apportioning liability as between a plaintiff and a defendant with respect to their respective shares in the responsibility for the damage involves a comparison of culpability, i.e. of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage. It is the whole conduct of each negligent party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which must be subjected to comparative examination. The significance of the various elements involved in such an examination will vary from case to case - Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Limited [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492 at 493-4; Oxley County Council v MacDonald & Ors; Brambles Holdings Limited v MacDonald & Ors [1999] NSWCA 126 per Sheller JA at [57].

110 The evidence establishes that the defendant supplied the cylinders in a cage and attached ramp. The ramp was made of chequerplate steel. The floor of the cage was raised from the level of the ground and accordingly the ramp was sloped to ground level - the degree of slope varying between the shorter and longer length of the ramp. The defendant stipulated that the cage be stored outside and therefore exposed to the elements. When the cage was fully loaded with cylinders, there was limited or no access to the front row of cylinders by trolleys used to convey the cylinders to the installation. The design of the cage and ramp was outside the plaintiff's control and within the control of the defendant (accepting that the defendant did not produce the gas or construct the cage and ramp).

111 The plaintiff had been supplied with gas bottles in the same form over a considerable period of time. It was the plaintiff's responsibility as an employer to conduct a proper risk assessment and to ensure a safe system of work. Similarly to the defendant's position, the plaintiff was aware of the location of the cage and ramp, the fact that it was accessible to weather, the slope and potential slipperiness of the ramp when wet, and the fact that workers were required to manhandle 125 kg gas cylinders.

112 Based on these factors, I conclude that the plaintiff and the defendant were equally responsible for the risk to the worker and for the injuries he received. In my opinion the proper apportionment therefore is 50-50."" (Red 45Q - 46U)

The appeal
Ground 1: The learned trial judge erred in finding that there was a duty of care owed by the appellant to Mr Anthony Spence.

55The appellant submitted that the finding that it owed a duty of care to the worker in the circumstances of this case extended the legal responsibility of a distributor to the employees of a customer further than had hitherto been recognised. It submitted that this unauthorised extension of the law was based on an erroneous understanding of the basis of the decision in Kuhl. The appellant submitted that this case fell outside a recognised relationship giving rise to a duty of care so that the ""salient features"" identified by Allsop P in Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649 at [103] should be taken into account. The appellant submitted that when regard was had to those salient features, it was obvious that they did not apply in this case.

56The appellant submitted that the determinative feature in Kuhl, which led to the plurality finding that a duty of care existed, was that it had done ""something more"" than simply supply plant or equipment. The ""something more"" comprised setting up the hose, clearing the blockages and directing and supervising the two operators. The appellant submitted that such features of active participation in the unloading of the cylinders by the appellant were absent in this case.

57The appellant submitted that the respondent received no assistance from Oxley County Council v MacDonald [1999] NSWCA 126. In that case Brambles was held liable to the injured worker because it exercised control over the reloading of the truck which caused the load to become unstable so as to eventually cause injury to the worker when he attempted to unload the truck. There had been no similar action by the appellant in this case.

58The appellant submitted that for a non-manufacturing distributor of goods such as it to owe a duty of care, it must know or have reason to know that there was a circumstance which foreseeably could cause injury. Exercising control over the way in which goods are loaded on a truck was plainly sufficient. The appellant accepted that knowledge of an inherent defect was also sufficient. The appellant submitted that there was no such inherent defect in this case since, as his Honour found, the longer ramp was ""just within the limits of slip resistance"", i.e. there was nothing inherently defective about it.

59The appellant submitted that when determining whether or not a duty of care existed, control was always important. In this case the appellant had no control over the unloading of the cylinders. It submitted that in the absence of the element of control, or there being something defective about which the appellant knew or ought to have known in relation to the gas cylinders, the appellant's case lacked the ""something more"" required to establish a duty of care on its part.

60In that regard, the appellant relied upon the statement of Hodgson JA in McPherson's Limited v Eaton at [27] where his Honour said:

""27 ... there is ... a world of difference between originating and putting into circulation something which otherwise would not exist, and merely being one of a number of persons involved in the distribution of something originated by someone else.""

61I do not agree that his Honour misunderstood or misapplied the decision in Kuhl. That case involved Mr Kuhl, as an employee of Transfield, entering reactors used in the production of iron and using a powerful vacuum hose to remove waste material. The vacuum hose, and associated equipment, was supplied and set up by WOMA, which also supplied two operators. The power which created the vacuum came from a truck which was also supplied by WOMA. WOMA was responsible for directing and supervising the operators and for setting up the vacuum hose and clearing blockages in it. On the day of the accident, a blockage occurred. In the course of trying to clear the blockage, an employee of WOMA passed the hose to Mr Kuhl whose left arm was sucked into the hose causing him severe injury. It was not suggested that the employee of WOMA who passed the hose, did so negligently.

62Mr Kuhl's case was that WOMA had breached the duty of care which it owed to him by failing to issue instructions not to pass the hose while the power was on and by failing to install a break-box, 10 or 15 metres from the head of the hose which could be employed to break the vacuum pressure at the hose end by letting air in.

63Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, the decision in Kuhl is analogous to the facts of this case and the statements of principle by the plurality and the minority on this issue are helpful. In that respect, the facts of this case are not as novel as the appellant submitted.

64The plurality found that WOMA owed Mr Kuhl a duty of care. Their reasons were:

""79 The nature of the duty. It was reasonably foreseeable to WOMA that the vacuum facility it provided to Transfield, and particularly the hose, would be used by Transfield employees to clean out the reactors. It was also reasonably foreseeable that from time to time the hose would get blocked and have to be unblocked. And it was reasonably foreseeable that different workers, whether employed by Transfield, WOMA or Hydrosweep, might work on the task of unblocking the hose, and hand it back and forth while the suction-creating power unit was in operation. Thus there was a duty on WOMA to provide a hose, truck and vacuuming facility that would not subject foreseeable users of the hose (including those who might be inadvertent at times) to an unreasonable risk of injury in relation to the uses to which it was reasonably foreseeable that it might be put. On that basis WOMA's duty of care extended to risks in relation to the passing of the hose, whether those risks arose from the way the hose was designed (for example, without a break box), or the way it was to be used (for example, without the protection of instruction to turn the power off while it was being handed back and forth between workers).""

65In Kuhl WOMA made a submission similar to that of the appellant in this case:

""81 ... The co-existence of knowledge of a risk of harm and power to avert or to minimise that harm does not, without more, give rise to a duty of care at common law. ...

The mere provision of plant and equipment to someone who intends to integrate it into their enterprise, and upon whom there is a common law duty to devise, institute and maintain a safe system of work, and to provide safe plant and equipment, cannot give rise to a common law duty of care to users of the equipment within the enterprise: something more must be needed. ...

The supplier of plant and equipment may not know, and may have no means of knowing, the manner in which the plant and equipment will be integrated into its [customer's] enterprise; or how work systems might be adapted to deal with contingencies encountered; it would lead to indeterminate liability; it would make tortious that which was otherwise lawful; it would hinder the efficient operation of commerce.""

66The plurality rejected that submission:

""82 However sound these submissions may be when applied to other circumstances, they are not sound here. WOMA knew, and had the means of knowing, how the fruits of Transfield's work in integrating the equipment within its system of work had developed, for it supplied not only equipment but also workers. However relevant the contract between WOMA and Transfield was, the Court of Appeal majority said it was never clearly explained in the evidence. Hence it has not been established that it restricted WOMA's duty. The incident-free history of the equipment is not irrelevant, but it is not determinative. The submission amounts to the proposition that, if an employer like Transfield owes a duty to its workers to maintain a safe system of work, there can never be a possibility of others owing the workers duties of care. The existence of a duty of care depends on the circumstances of each case; in this case the circumstances were sufficient to create the duty in WOMA which was stated above, which includes the duty that was conceded in the Court of Appeal. That was because of WOMA's special role in supplying the equipment, setting up the hose, clearing blockages and directing and supervising the two operators.""

67Those statements of principle, when applied to the facts of this case, favour the finding that a duty of care was owed by the appellant to the worker. The duty of care is that identified by his Honour at Red 39Q (see [50] hereof).

68It was reasonably foreseeable by the appellant that the gas cylinders would be unloaded as they were, i.e. by a single worker, using the ramp and doing his best to manoeuvre a heavy and awkward cylinder down the ramp in circumstances where he had to position his feet on the ramp, there being no room available on the surface of the cage on which the cylinders were positioned. It was also reasonably foreseeable that the ramp could become wet because it was known to the appellant that cages of cylinders were positioned in the open. For those reasons, it was also reasonably foreseeable that when attempting to perform such an activity, a worker could slip and be injured because of the weight and awkward shape of the cylinders and the slope and wetness of the ramp.

69In supplying the cage loaded with full cylinders to a customer such as the respondent, the appellant did not merely supply a product or plant and equipment. The cage was designed to enable the cylinders to be unloaded in the manner described above and that was the most likely method that the customers and their employees would use to unload cylinders from the cage. In accordance with the reasoning of the plurality in Kuhl, there was a duty on the appellant to provide a cage and ramp which did not, used in this way, subject those foreseeable users to an unreasonable risk of slipping on the ramp while doing so.

70It is not correct that there was no inherent defect with the cage because the ramp was ""just within the limits of slip resistance"". Such a submission misunderstands his Honour's finding and the evidence of the experts, in particular, that of Dr Cooke. The ""limits of slip resistance"" to which Dr Cooke and his Honour were referring related to the Australian Standard applicable to persons walking over surfaces in an industrial context. If the surface of the ramp was ""just within the limits of slip resistance"" in that context, it was well below such a limit when one took into account that the activity being performed was the movement of a heavy and awkward object down a wet slope.

71Even without the test results of Dr Cooke all the experts, particularly Mr Horrigan, agreed that the unloading procedure used by the worker was inherently unsafe. Such an assessment did not depend upon expert opinion as to the degree of slipperiness, but was obvious from the nature of the unloading activity itself. It was a situation like that referred to in Neill v NSW Fresh Food & Ice Pty Limited [1963] HCA 4; 108 CLR 362 where Taylor and Owen JJ said at 368:

""In many cases no more than common knowledge or perhaps common sense, is necessary to enable one to perceive the existence of a real risk of injury and to permit one to say what reasonable and appropriate precautions might appropriately be taken to have avoid it.""

See also Hamilton v Nuroof (WA) Pty Ltd [1956] HCA 42; 96 CLR 18 at 24.

72The dangers associated with unloading the cage as the worker did were real and evident.

73The appellant sought to distinguish the statements of principle in Kuhl from the facts of this case because WOMA not only supplied equipment, but also workers. That is to misunderstand the reasoning of the plurality at [82]. The significance of WOMA having some workers on the premises was that this gave it the means of knowing how Transfield had integrated the WOMA equipment within its system of work. That was not necessary in this case. The very construction of the cage invited the method of unloading which was used, i.e. the ramp was an integral part of the cage and was plainly intended for the manual unloading of cylinders and the loading of the cylinders to the very edge meant that the worker had to position himself on the ramp without three secure points of contact. 

74Moreover, the Incident Report and the reports of Mr Dohrmann and Mr Horrigan made it clear that this method of unloading was ""standard practice throughout Australia"". Accordingly, it was not necessary for the appellant to have workers present on the respondent's site because it knew or had reason to know that the gas cylinders would be manhandled down the ramp, in the manner in which they were, in circumstances where the ramp could be wet. As Kuhl also made clear, the fact that the respondent might have owed a duty of care to the worker, did not necessarily exclude the appellant also owing such a duty.

75In line with the reasoning of the plurality in Kuhl, the question is did the appellant owe a duty of care to the worker to take reasonable care to supply a cage and ramp for its gas cylinders which would not subject him as a foreseeable user to an unreasonable risk of injury while moving the gas cylinders? The relevant relationship was not that between the worker and the respondent, but between the appellant on the one hand and the worker on the other. It was a relationship brought into existence by the distribution by the appellant of large cumbersome 125 kg gas cylinders in a cage with a purpose built integrated ramp, plainly intended to be used in unloading cylinders without the provision of a safe and stable place to stand when the first few cylinders were to be unloaded.

76As was said by Gummow J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36; 198 CLR 180 at [198]:

""198 ... In determining whether the relationship is so close that the duty of care arises, attention is to be paid to the particular connections between the parties."" 

The manner in which the appellant chose to present its goods created a direct relationship between the appellant and whomsoever might attempt to unload the cage by use of the integrated, purpose built ramp. The relationship was so close that a duty arose. It matters not whether the appellant owned the cages. That was the mechanism by which it chose to supply the gas.

77The special role of the appellant in this case was the supplying of cylinders and a cage which invited a particular method of unloading which was inherently dangerous in the knowledge that potentially the ramp could be wet.

78The facts of this case would also give rise to the existence of a duty of care owed by the appellant to the worker by reference to the reasoning of the minority in Kuhl. At [20] the minority said:

""20 ... Such an approach runs the risk of predetermining the outcome before considering the first important step; whether WOMA owed Mr Kuhl a duty of care to begin with and, if so, what was the scope and content of that duty. Those questions are determined by considering reasonable foreseeability and the ""salient features"" of the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant.""

79The minority went on to say:

""26 ... WOMA was not responsible for the training of Mr Kuhl nor was Mr Kuhl subject to WOMA's control. However, the supervision of the vacuuming facility by WOMA's servants, and its obvious knowledge that persons like Mr Kuhl would be using the vacuuming hose for the purpose for which WOMA provided the hose, indicates that it was reasonable to require WOMA to have persons like Mr Kuhl in contemplation as people who might be put at risk by WOMA's negligence in providing and operating the vacuuming facility. There are also no considerations of indeterminacy or incoherence that tend against a finding of duty on the part of the WOMA.

27 The critical question in this case concerns the scope and content of the duty owed by WOMA. The evidence outlined above supports the finding of a duty to take reasonable care to provide a hose, truck and vacuuming facility that would not subject foreseeable users of the hose to an unreasonable risk of injury. This duty concerns the condition of the equipment ... Even a foreseeable user of the hose exercising proper care would necessarily include a worker who may, upon undertaking repetitive tasks, be inadvertent at times.""

80The salient features in this case are:

The appellant knew that the cage with its integrated ramp would be subject to weather conditions because it was positioned in the open.

The appellant was aware of the dimensions of the cage, particularly when fully loaded.

The appellant knew of the size and weight of the gas bottles.

The appellant knew of the limited horizontal area available to the worker when attempting to remove cylinders from the first row.

The appellant knew, or ought to have known, that a worker would remove the full cylinders by using the chequerplate metal ramp.

The appellant ought to have known that a full cylinder would be removed in this way since according to the Incident Report and the reports of Messrs Dohrmann and Horrigan, this was the standard method used in Australia for such an activity.

When contemplating the foreseeable risk of injury, the appellant knew that unloading the cylinders was a repetitive task where inadvertence may play a part because it was done on a regular basis over some years.

81Applying the reasoning of the minority to the facts of this case, the duty owed by the appellant to the respondent would be to take reasonable care to provide cylinders in a cage that would not subject foreseeable users to an unreasonable risk of injury. Accordingly, whichever approach is used, either that of the minority or plurality in Kuhl, the statements of principle when applied to the facts of this case, support the existence of a duty of care owed by the appellant to the worker. The duty was to provide cylinders in a cage that would not subject foreseeable users, including those who might be inadvertent at times, to an unreasonable risk of injury when attempting to manually unload them by using the integrated ramp on the cage.

82The facts of this case are to be distinguished from those in McPherson's Limited v Eaton in that the appellant knew or had reason to know that the cylinders and cage contained an inherent danger arising from the expected method by which they would be unloaded. The level of knowledge of the appellant in that regard was significantly greater than that of the supplier of asbestos products in Eaton where that supplier had no knowledge or reason to know that the asbestos in the products was dangerous.

Ground 2: The learned trial judge erred in apportioning liability for the injury to Mr Spence on a 50/50 basis as between the appellant and the respondent.

83The appellant submitted that although his Honour had correctly stated the relevant principles, his exercise of discretion in apportioning liability had miscarried because his reasoning contained errors and omissions. It submitted that a proper apportionment would have been 90 percent against the respondent and 10 percent against the appellant.

84The errors relied upon by the appellant were:

(a) That it was factually incorrect to say ""the defendant stipulated that the cage be stored outside and therefore exposed to the elements"" (Red 46J).

(b) There was no evidence to support the finding that the design of the cage and ramp was ""within the control of the defendant"" (Red 46L).

In relation to (b), the appellant submitted that there was no evidence that it had any influence, control or capacity to control the design of the cage and ramp. The appellant submitted that in the absence of any evidence to support that finding, his Honour should not have taken it into account.

85The appellant submitted that his Honour failed to take into account that the ""duties imposed in law upon an employer in relation to the system of work required a much higher standard than is imposed upon a distributor of goods"" which had no control over the occupation of the site, nor the manner in which the client to whom the goods were provided, carried out the unloading operation.

86The appellant submitted that although his Honour had correctly stated the relevant principles applicable to apportioning liability he had failed to apply them correctly because he had failed to take into account relevant factors which impacted upon the culpability of the respondent and the contribution which its conduct made to the occurrence of the accident. The appellant submitted that there were matters relevant to those questions to which his Honour had not referred when considering apportionment:

The worker was not given refresher courses in relation to the task he was required to do because of his roster.

The worker had complained about a problem with the job but the problem had not been remedied.

The Incident Report identified actions which should have been taken by the respondent by way of injury prevention.

87The appellant's first challenge to his Honour's factual findings is not made out. The evidence clearly supported his Honour's finding that it was a requirement of the appellant that the cage be positioned in the open.

88The appellant's second challenge does, however, identify a respect in which his Honour mistook a relevant fact. In doing so his Honour also failed to take into account relevant matters, namely the ""actions"" available to be undertaken by the respondent and referred to in the Incident Report. There was no evidence as to who designed the cage and the ramp. The only evidence was that the cage had a ""BASF"" brand on it, that the cage with the cylinders was delivered by truck, by or on behalf of the appellant, and that in recent times the cages did not have a ramp. Although Mr Segerius surmised that the absence of a ramp was due to a decision of the appellant, he provided no factual basis for that surmise.

89Accordingly, his Honour erred in concluding that the design of the cage and ramp was within the control of the appellant. More significantly, he erred in proceeding on the basis that the respondent could do little about the ""design of the cage and ramp"" because they were outside its control. The evidence was that there were measures which the respondent could have taken to reduce the risk of injury to its employees when unloading the cage notwithstanding that it was designed to be unloaded using the sloping ramp. Those steps did not require any alteration to that current design. They included providing blocks of wood or other supports so as to make the ramp flat, providing anti-slip matting for use on the ramp, providing training to its employees directed to reducing the risk of slipping on the ramp and, possibly, providing a machine to enable the cylinders to be lifted directly from the cage. Those possible actions were either referred to in the Incident Report (see [43]) or the subject of evidence from Dr Cooke and Mr Horrigan.

90In relation to the other challenge made by the appellant, while it is not correct to say that an employer had to meet ""a much higher standard"" than a supplier, it is true that in relation to the worker, the respondent as his employer had much greater responsibilities for his welfare than did the appellant whose obligation was restricted to the safety of the cage itself. As the appellant submitted, it was the respondent which was in control of the unloading of the cylinders. Moreover, it is implicit in the Incident Report that before the accident the respondent had identified a problem with removing the cylinders and had tried different types of lifting machines without success. Thereafter the respondent seems to have done nothing about the problem which it had thus identified.

91There were, as the appellant submitted, other failings on the part of the respondent in its obligations to provide the worker with a safe system of work insofar as the unloading of the cylinders was concerned. Although his Honour had identified these, he did not refer to them when dealing with the question of apportionment.

92Because his Honour took into account a factually incorrect consideration and failed to take into account the matters referred to above, this Court's jurisdiction to review the discretionary judgment in relation to apportionment is engaged: A V Jennings Pty Ltd v Maumill (1956) 30 ALJR 100 at 101; Tarabay v Leite [2008] NSWCA 259 at [31].

93Whilst the appellant owed a duty of care to Mr Spence to provide a cage and ramp which, when used as it was intended to be used, did not subject foreseeable users to an unreasonable risk of injury, the respondent as his employer remained subject to its obligation to take reasonable steps to provide him with adequate plant and equipment and a safe system of work. That obligation could not be discharged by the respondent by entrusting those tasks to others, such as the appellant: Kondis v State Transport Authority [1984] HCA 61; 154 CLR 672 at 680-681. 

94Although the appellant breached its duty in providing the cage and ramp, there were a number of steps which the respondent could have taken to provide Mr Spence with a safer system of work. Those are the actions referred to above. I would apportion liability as to 75 percent against the respondent and 25 percent against the appellant. That apportionment takes account of the respondent's primary responsibility for the safety of its employees in circumstances where it was aware that the task of unloading the cylinders involved significant risk to a plant operator such as Mr Spence and did not take precautions which were reasonably available to be taken by it.

Ground 3: The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence Exhibit A, the report of Dr J Cooke, dated 23 June 2009.

95The appellant objected to the admissibility of Dr Cooke's report at trial on a number of bases. The first was that his evidence was irrelevant unless a significant connection could be established between the ramp on which the worker slipped when the accident occurred and the ramp which Dr Cooke tested. His Honour rejected that objection because he was satisfied that there was a sufficient similarity between the ramp which Dr Cooke tested and the ramp involved in the accident. Certainly the photocopies of the actual cage in the Incident Report support such a similarity. The evidence of the worker and Mr Segerius was to similar effect.

96In rejecting that objection, his Honour made the point that the evidence of Dr Cooke was not that the test results which he obtained were the same as those which would have been obtained had the ramp involved in the accident been tested, but that those results were indicative of the sort of co-efficient of friction likely to be operative on the ramp which was in use at the time of the accident. That objection has not been raised in the appeal. That is appropriate in that there was ample evidence available to support his Honour's ruling.

97The appeal has raised two issues. The first was another aspect of relevance. The appellant submitted that the report of Dr Cooke related to slip resistance for pedestrian surfaces in an industrial context. The worker's accident did not take place on a pedestrian surface, but on a foldout ramp on a cage used for the transporting and storing of gas cylinders. The appellant submitted that Dr Cooke's opinion about the slip resistance suitability of a pedestrian surface had no relevance in a case concerning the slip resistance of a ramp on a cage.

98The second issue was that the report of Dr Cooke did not comply with s79(1) of the Evidence Act 1995. The appellant relied upon Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 at [32] where the plurality said:

""32 To be admissible under s 79(1) the evidence that is tendered must satisfy two criteria. The first is that the witness who gives the evidence ""has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience""; the second is that the opinion expressed in evidence by the witness ""is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge"".""

99The appellant submitted that Dr Cooke was not an ergonomist, nor was he an engineer, and had no qualifications which would permit him to give evidence in relation to alternative systems of work. The appellant submitted that this was what Dr Cooke had done at Blue 52G - L of his report which stated:

""32 That task would have been less hazardous than the task being performed by Mr Spence at the time of the accident because the flap would not have been steeply sloping. If appropriate fold-out legs were fitted to the flap, it could be dropped down to provide a horizontal surface. Alternatively, blocks of wood or other supports of the correct height could have been used to make the flap into a horizontal surface. However, the ramp in that position (propped up to make a horizontal platform) would not have provided a completely safe working platform because of the need to manhandle the cylinders onto the trolley.""

100I do not agree that the opinion of Dr Cooke in relation to the Australian Standard for a pedestrian surface in an industrial context was irrelevant in the way suggested by the appellant. There was no standard which directly applied to the chequerplate ramp used by the worker when he was injured. All that Dr Cooke did was to look for an analogous standard and by reference to that standard, indicate by way of comparative reasoning how much more slippery, and therefore dangerous, was the ramp being used by the worker when he was injured.

101Looked at in that way, that opinion of Dr Cooke was clearly relevant to the issues which his Honour had to decide. As was said by the High Court in Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; 62 ALR 85:-

""... The passages from Wigmore on Evidence cited by Samuels JA in the Court of Appeal to the effect that it is a question of fact whether the case supposed is sufficiently like the one under consideration to render the opinion of the expert of any value are in accordance with both principle and common sense.""

102The second challenge to the opinion of Dr Cooke is also not made out. The academic qualifications of Dr Cooke went well beyond those of an architect (Blue 48C-K, 145E-147V). Academically he had degrees in science, architecture, and law and is a doctor of philosophy. From his resume he was not only a Member of the Australian Standards Committee, but is familiar with industrial standards generally, with particular expertise in slip testing. He has given evidence in court cases over many years.

103The corollary to being an expert in accidents involving slippery surfaces is that such an expert is also experienced in responses to slippery surfaces. In this case the response suggested by Dr Cooke did not require any particular expertise, but was largely a matter of common sense. If an important part of the risk to which the worker was exposed was a sloping ramp over which he had to move a heavy object, the removal of that slope as a matter of common sense would significantly reduce the risk. 

104As a matter of practicality, however, the objection goes nowhere since the responses to the foreseeable risk of injury identified by Dr Cooke were fully endorsed by the appellant's engineer, Mr Horrigan.

105This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 4: The learned trial judge erred in finding that the ramp supplied as part of the cage was not safe for its purpose.

Ground 5: The learned trial judge erred in finding that the design of the cage and ramp were within the control of the appellant.

Ground 6: The learned trial judge erred in finding that the appellant knew or ought to have known that the manual system of work utilised by the respondent for unloading the heavy cylinders from the cage.

Ground 8: His Honour erred in finding that it was reasonably open to the appellant to use chocks and legs on the ramp provided as part of the cage.

Ground 9: His Honour erred in determining liability upon the basis that the existence of a reasonably practical alternative was determinative of whether or not the appellant was negligent in providing the cage and attached ramp which it provided.

106These grounds all raise aspects of breach of duty and can be dealt with together.

107The appellant submitted that because the longer ramp was of the type involved in the accident, the finding that it had a co-efficient of friction that was ""within normal limits"" meant that it was safe for the purpose for which it was being used.

108I have already indicated why that submission has not been made out. It misunderstands the evidence of Dr Cooke and the finding by his Honour. The ramp was not unsafe as a pedestrian walkway. It was unsafe when assessed in the context of its intended use. That use was the task of manhandling a 125 kg cylinder to ground level in circumstances where the ramp was wet. Mr Horrigan agreed with that assessment.

109The appellant submitted that because there was no evidence that the design of the cage and ramp was within the control of the appellant, his Honour erred in finding that a reasonable response to the foreseeable risk of injury by the appellant would have been to fit foldout legs to the ramp. 

110This submission conflates two concepts. For the reasons already indicated, there was no evidence as to what part, if any, the appellant played in the design of the ramp. Whether the appellant had power to make an alteration to the ramp, raises a different issue. There was no evidence either way. There was, however, evidence that this was the means by which the appellant chose to supply gas, i.e. in a cage, with a ramp.

111When the matter came to trial, the appellant had available the report of Dr Cooke and the report of Mr Horrigan. The appellant well knew that the respondent would be submitting that a response to the foreseeable risk of injury was for the appellant to supply a ramp with foldout legs. The appellant did not adduce any evidence on that issue except for the report of Mr Horrigan.

112In those circumstances, the observations of Gibbs J (with whom Stephen and Mason JJ agreed) in Nelson v John Lysaght (Australia) Ltd [1975] HCA 9; 132 CLR 201 at 214 are appropriate:

""The onus of proving that it was unreasonable not to take the precaution, of course, lay on the appellant. However, when the respondent, which must have had full knowledge of the nature, cost and practical consequences of the new installation, gave no evidence, and by its counsel asked no questions, to suggest that it was inordinately expensive or in any other way disadvantageous, the jury was entitled to infer at the very least that the advantages of the method which the respondent has since adopted were not outweighed by any disadvantages.

The evidence was such as to entitle the jury to reach the conclusion that the respondent's system of work in force at the time of the accident, notwithstanding that it involved the provision of protective clothing, was such as to expose the appellant to a clear risk of serious injury, that it was practicable to eliminate or minimise that risk by the adoption of a different method, namely, that which has in fact since been adopted, and that it was unreasonable of the respondent not to have adopted that method before the accident occurred.""

113It follows that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary from the appellant, it was open to his Honour to infer that the relatively simple modification to the ramp was practicable and could have been carried out by the appellant.

114The appellant submitted that there was no evidence to support his Honour's finding that the appellant knew, or ought to have known, about the manual system of work utilised by the respondent for unloading the heavy cylinders from the cage. In particular, there was no evidence that the appellant, through any of its servants, observed the respondent's process of unloading the cages.

115This submission is not made out. There is the evidence in the Incident Report at Blue 21P that ""it is standard practice throughout Australia to manhandle cylinders in this way"". That proposition was never traversed by the appellant. Moreover, the design of the cage with its chequerplate ramp was consistent with that evidence and invited that method of manually unloading gas bottles from the cage. Mr Dohrmann said that this method of unloading cylinders was common in Australia. Mr Horrigan said that it was an old method which had been in use since the 1960's.

116The appellant submitted that the alternative systems identified by his Honour, i.e. attaching foldout legs or advising the respondent to use chocks, were not a reasonable response to the foreseeable risk of injury. Because this manual system of unloading gas cylinders was generally used in Australia, a reasonable person in the position of the appellant did not have an obligation to do anything. In that regard, the appellant relied upon the observation of McHugh J in Dovuro Pty Ltd v Wilkins [2003] HCA 51; 215 CLR 315 at [38]:

""38 A defendant is not negligent merely because it fails to take an alternative course of conduct that would have eliminated the risk of damage. The plaintiff must show that the defendant was not acting reasonably in failing to take that course. If inaction is a course reasonably open to the defendant, the plaintiff fails to prove negligence even if there were alternatives open to the defendant that would have eliminated the risk.""

117This submission is not made out. The risk which required a response by the appellant was the distribution by it of large cumbersome 125 kg gas cylinders in a cage with a purpose built, integrated ramp. The ramp was plainly intended to be used in unloading cylinders without the provision of a safe and stable place to stand when the first few cylinders were unloaded. Where the potential consequences of that unsafe system of work involved the risk of serious injury to the person unloading the cylinders, inaction was not an option for the appellant.

118Once it is accepted that some response to the foreseeable risk of injury by the appellant was necessary, then the issue becomes the adequacy of the responses found to be reasonable by his Honour and that issue has already been addressed.

119Although his Honour did not deal with every aspect of s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (CLA), he did make appropriate references to it and it is clear that in his analysis of breach of duty, he followed the steps therein set out.

120His Honour considered the foreseeable nature of the risk and determined that the risk was not insignificant. As a result, he concluded that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have taken appropriate precautions. In relation to that decision, it is clear that his Honour had regard to the matters raised in s 5B(2), i.e. the probability that harm would occur if care were not taken, the likely seriousness of the harm, the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm and the social utility of the activity which created the harm.

121These grounds of appeal, which challenged his Honour's conclusions as to breach of duty, have not been made out.

Ground 7: The learned trial judge in directing his inquiry on liability to the duty owed to the respondent and not to the duty owed to Mr Spence.

122This ground of appeal was not pursued.

Ground 10: The learned trial judge erred in determining the question of liability on the basis that had a cage been provided with a ramp with chocks and/or legs on the ramp to enable the ramp to be level, the risk of injury to any worker moving gas cylinders would have been ""reduced"", rather than the correct questions namely whether it was unreasonable not to have done so in this case and whether doing so would have avoided the accident to Mr Spence. 

123This ground, in terms, addresses considerations raised by s 5B(1)(c) and (2) CLA. The appellant's arguments relating to those considerations have been dealt with above. In oral argument the appellant also submitted that a finding of a ""reduced"" risk of injury would not satisfy the requirements of factual causation in s 5D(1) CLA because, as his Honour recognised (Red 44N-P), a worker ""would still be required to manhandle the gas cylinder from the cage, across a level chequerplate ramp"" and could suffer injury in the process of so doing. The appellant submitted that a finding that the risk of injury would have been ""reduced"" was not sufficient to establish factual causation.

124This submission is not made out. Section 5D CLA relevantly provides:

""5(1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements:

(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and

...""

125The most recent statement of principle in relation to s 5D is in Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5; 86 ALJR 267 where the plurality said:

""18 The determination of factual causation under s 5D(1)(a) is a statutory statement of the ""but for"" test of causation: the plaintiff would not have suffered the particular harm but for the defendant's negligence. While the value of that test as a negative criterion of causation has long been recognised, two kinds of limitations have been identified. First, it produces anomalous results in particular cases, exemplified by those in which there is more than one sufficient condition of the plaintiff's harm. Secondly, it does not address the policy considerations that are bound up in the attribution of legal responsibility for harm.""

126The decision in Strong recognises that the test of factual causation in s 5D(1)(a) may be satisfied in circumstances not only where the defendant's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm, but also in circumstances where there were two sets of conditions jointly sufficient to account for the occurrence of the harm and the defendant's negligence was necessary to complete one of those sets of conditions.

""20 Under the statute, factual causation requires proof that the defendant's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the particular harm. A necessary condition is a condition that must be present for the occurrence of the harm. However, there may be more than one set of conditions necessary for the occurrence of particular harm and it follows that a defendant's negligent act or omission which is necessary to complete a set of conditions that are jointly sufficient to account for the occurrence of the harm will meet the test of factual causation within s 5D(1)(a). In such a case, the defendant's conduct may be described as contributing to the occurrence of the harm."" 

127To the extent that the appellant's submission is that causation is not made out if there is more than one necessary condition for the occurrence of the injury, that submission must be rejected.

128In State of Victoria v Bryar & Anor (1970) 44 ALJR 174 Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan Owen and Walsh JJ agreed) said at 175:

""To satisfy the element of causation, generally speaking it would be necessary to identify the nature of the step which the jury on the available evidence could conclude that a teacher ought to have taken but did not take. That act, if the failure to take it is to be accounted negligent, must be such as the foreseeable risk of injury would require having regard to the nature of the risk and the extent of injury should the risk mature into actuality. It is necessary that the jury should conclude as a matter of evidence and inference that more probable than not the taking of that step or steps would have prevented or minimised the injury which was in fact received.""

129Statements to similar effect were made in Kuhl by the minority at [45] and by the plurality at [104]. In Roche Mining Pty Ltd v Graeme Wayne Jeffs [2011] NSWCA 184 McColl JA (with whom Basten JA and Tobias AJA agreed] said:

""81 Roche's written submissions on causation contended that the respondent had to establish that the transverse stair access system would have obviated the risk of injury and that it was not sufficient that it be established that that system would have reduced the risk. It is apparent from Kuhl (and numerous other authorities, as to which see Varga v Galea [2011] NSWCA 76 (at [25])) that that submission must be rejected. It is sufficient that the suggested precaution would have minimised the injury. The primary judge (at [118]) accepted the expert evidence that such a system would have significantly reduced the risk of injury. That was sufficient to discharge the respondent's burden of proof in this respect.""

See also Indigo Mist Pty Ltd v Palmer [2012] NSWCA 239 at [98] - [102].

130Those cases make it clear that the relevant question as to factual causation, which the trial judge was required to and did address, was whether more probably than not, the taking of steps to make the ramp horizontal by using chocks or inserting foldout legs would have prevented or minimised the injuries sustained by Mr Spence.

131Mr Spence's injuries occurred because his left foot slipped on the wet sloping ramp as he was manoeuvring the gas cylinder down that ramp. His Honour found that the use of some mechanism to prop up the ramp so that it formed a horizontal platform would have reduced the risk of injury to any worker moving gas cylinders: [Red 44N-P). He also found that although the risk of slipping was addressed by eliminating the slope of the ramp, there remained a risk of injury because the worker would still be required to manhandle the cylinders from the platform and down some 15 centimetres onto a trolley. The trial judge's findings were sufficient to justify his Honour's conclusion that the injuries which Mr Spence had sustained as a result of slipping on the sloping and wet ramp would not have occurred if the ramp had been flat, which would have been the case had the appellant or respondent taken the measures that ought to have been taken.

132For these reasons, the appellant's argument that his Honour erred in finding factual causation is rejected. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Conclusion

133It follows from the above that the appellant has been partially successful in the appeal in that I have found error in his Honour's apportionment of liability. Otherwise, the appellant's challenge to his Honour's finding of liability against it has failed.

134Since most of the appeal was devoted to the appellant's challenge to liability, the appellant should not have the whole of its costs of the appeal, even though it has been partially successful. In the circumstances of this appeal, it is reasonable that the appellant recover 50 percent of its costs.

135The situation is different in relation to the trial. Except for brief submissions as to apportionment, the trial focused entirely upon liability. Since the respondent was successful on that issue, the appellant should pay the costs of the trial.

136The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) The appeal is allowed in part.

(2) The judgment that the respondent is entitled to contribution of 50 percent of the amount paid to the worker is set aside.

(3) In lieu thereof, there should be judgment that the respondent is entitled to contribution of 25 percent of the amount paid by it to the worker.

(4) The respondent is to pay 50 percent of the appellant's costs of the appeal.

(5) Otherwise the orders made by his Honour are confirmed.

137BERGIN CJ in EQ: I agree with Hoeben JA.

		01 November 2012",2012-10-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2760359,R v Genua; R v Hardy [2012] NSWDC 280,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Earlier this year I sentenced two men, Shane Skinner and Gregory Elliott, for an offence of conspiring to commit an armed robbery in November 2009 with each other and with two other men who appear for sentence today, Nathan Hardy and John Genua. In addition Mr Genua is to be sentenced for a large number of other offences committed over a relatively short time in July and August 2011.

2In November 2009 police were monitoring various telephones and they became aware that the four men I have named were planning to commit an armed robbery. They listened as the men spoke to each over the telephone as they agreed to commit the offence and as they planned various aspects of what was to occur.

3In the early afternoon of 10 November 2009 the four men were arrested before the offence could be committed. Mr Genua was with Mr Skinner. They were in a stolen BMW X3 with Mr Genua driving. The arrest was effected by officers from the Tactical Operations Group. They surrounded the BMW driven by Mr Genua, but instead of immediately giving up he drove that vehicle towards a police vehicle before colliding with it. Because of what he did as police arrested him he has admitted his guilt of using the motor vehicle as an offensive weapon with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension as well as taking and driving the vehicle knowing that it was stolen. He asked that I take those matters into account when I sentence him for conspiring to commit the armed robbery.

4When the BMW was searched police located items clearly intended to be used in the armed robbery, a replica pistol, a shortened Remington rifle and a balaclava, amongst other items.

5Mr Hardy was arrested later after having avoided arrest in rather dramatic circumstances. Although at trial he faced a charge of using an offensive weapon, namely, a motor vehicle, to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself, the jury found him not guilty of that offence. They did, however, find him guilty of the offence of conspiring to commit an armed robbery and that is the only offence for which he appears for sentence today.

6After Mr Genua had been in custody awaiting trial he was given an opportunity to attend a residential rehabilitation centre. He went straight from gaol to Odyssey House. The clothes that he would need for the duration of the rehabilitation program were delivered to him by his partner. Unfortunately when they were searched four Xanax tablets were discovered. It appears that those Xanax tablets had been in his clothes for some time. Mr Genua's partner did not know about them as Mr Genua had forgotten about them, but of course introducing drugs into a residential rehabilitation facility is a serious matter even when that may have been inadvertent. 

7Mr Genua was given the opportunity of remaining at the program with a support person other than his partner, but he refused. Thereafter he went downhill, committing a large number of offences which I will shortly describe and which culminated in the offender planning to commit suicide. Fortunately he was arrested before he could carry out what he had planned to do. 

8Mr Genua's more recent offending commenced when he stole a car from a car yard on Parramatta Road. He simply got into the vehicle, which was not locked with the keys in the ignition, and drove off. When I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account seven other offences. Firstly, stealing a white Toyota Hilux on 8 August 2001, when the accused got into the unlocked Hilux, which had its keys in the ignition and drove away. The next offence to be taken into account is another one of taking and driving a conveyance, when the offender once more took a car which had been left unattended with the keys in the ignition. That car had been left in that condition by staff at a carwash. He used an unauthorised numberplate when driving that vehicle and that represents another offence to be taken into account.

9He also asks that I take into account four other offences committed on 25 August 2011. They began when the offender took a car that was not his from a service station. Once more it had been left with the keys in the ignition, this time when the owner went to pay for fuel. Two days later on 27 August police saw the stolen vehicle and attempted to stop it. The offender then drove the stolen vehicle in a way which caused an impact with another vehicle, negligent driving, and then when police ran to arrest him he resisted. On top of all of that he should not have been driving in the car in the first place because he was unlicensed. 

10On 11 August the offender robbed a woman by the name of Tanya Stevenson. She was standing waiting for a lift when the offender approached her and grabbed her handbag. They struggled for possession of it before one of the handles broke which enabled Mr Genua to take the handbag away. When I sentence him for that matter he asked that I take into account eight other offences. An attempted robbery committed two days earlier when the offender pushed a woman named Mari Ly to the ground and tried to drag her handbag out of her possession. Ms Ly would not let go and there was a struggle which only ended when a bystander intervened. Not surprisingly the victim of that offence was left crying and shaking.

11The next matter he wants me to take into account is a robbery committed on 12 August and a steal from person offence committed at the same time. A couple in their seventies were walking along the road, one of them carrying a handbag and the other carrying a black case which contained hearing aids and accessories. The offender pushed one of those people, a seventy-seven year old man, which caused him to fall backwards, landing heavily on his back, hitting his head on a concrete floor. Rather than stopping and helping this poor unfortunate man Mr Genua simply took the black case that he had been holding and grabbed the handbag off that man's wife and drove away. 

12A few days later he committed yet another offence which he asked me to take into account. He had been using a stolen vehicle in the course of his offending, it was time to get rid of it so the offender simply set it on fire. Unfortunately the owner of that vehicle had no insurance cover so the loss to him was substantial.

13The next matter to be taken into account occurred on 24 August. The offender was seen by police getting into a stolen motor vehicle. When they tried to arrest him the offender drove the vehicle towards a police officer who had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. He did it again, this time to a different police officer and then drove away. This is an offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension. As he was driving away he drove in a dangerous manner which led to him colliding with the front of an unmarked police vehicle. Of course he did not stop, he simply drove away and that is an offence of driving in a manner dangerous to the public.

14The final two matters to be taken into account when I sentence him for the robbery of Ms Stevenson occurred on 27 August 2011. On that day he was arrested. Four vials of Xanax tablets and a resealable bag containing forty-six grams of cannabis leaf was found upon him. His possession of those substances represents the two final matters to be taken into account when I sentence him for the robbery of Ms Stevenson.

15The next matter for which the offender Mr Genua must be sentenced in a substantive way is an offence of stealing from a person. On the same day he robbed Ms Stevenson he also robbed Anthea Lois. She was with her cousin and her cousin's three young children in a car park. She had put her handbag on top of a shopping trolley and was standing next to it. The offender grabbed it and ran away and got into a motor vehicle. Ms Lois did not give up, she did not take the loss of her handbag lightly. She grabbed the door of the motor vehicle trying to open it and screamed at him, ""Give me back my handbag, please"". He drove away, but Ms Lois' hand was stuck in the door. When she removed her hand she fell to the ground and her right foot and the right side of her body were run over. She was taken to hospital where she was treated for bruising and pain to her back. When I sentence him for that matter I am to take into account the offence of driving recklessly. Although the material tendered by the Crown does not make it clear, that presumably relates to the way the offender drove away from Ms Lois, running her over in the process. 

16The day after those offences the offender committed another steal from person offence. Shortly after the attack on the elderly couple that I had mentioned earlier the offender took the handbag of a Ms Belinda Donovan from a shopping trolley car park. That offence of stealing from a person is a substantive matter for sentence. He asks that I take into account another offence of stealing from a person relating to a handbag which he took at exactly the same time. Once more the victims of these offences did not take matters lightly. They too attempted to stop the offender, who had got into the stolen utility, but the offender drove away. Fortunately on this occasion no one was injured.

17As well as that offence of stealing from a person the offender asks that I take into account two other offences of stealing from a person committed earlier in time, one on 17 July and the other on 18 July. On the 17th the offender took a handbag which was on the passenger seat of a car parked in a car park. On the 18th the offender did a similar thing, this time after telling the driver she had a flat tyre and removing her handbag as she got out of the vehicle to have a look.

18It is no exaggeration to say that all of the offences committed by the offender in the middle of 2011 justify a description of Mr Genua as being a one man crime wave.

19Some time ago now the Court of Criminal Appeal explained the seriousness of bag snatching offences. It was pointed out that offences such as those just described are a serious breach of the peace. Bag snatching offences are easy to commit, especially when the victims are elderly or distracted by the need to care for children, and the offender's efforts in taking their handbags, preventing their recovery and preventing his arrest show that he was willing to resort to violence and risk injuries to innocent people without much hesitation at all. That he committed these offences after being given bail so he could demonstrate his rehabilitation is a serious aggravating feature of these offences. The many victims of his offending in 2011 are entitled to be less than impressed with the circumstances that have led the criminal justice system operating in a way which meant that they were the victims of serious crimes.

20Mr Genua is now forty-three years of age. He gave evidence during the sentence proceedings before me. I formed the impression from what he said and the way he said it that he was a totally broken man, who now had enormous regret for the way he had been living his life and for the situation he now finds himself in. 

21To say that Mr Genua's upbringing was dysfunctional is an understatement. His hardships began before he was even born, his mother was a heroin addict. Things did not get much better after he was born. His mother worked as a prostitute and she would take him with her whilst she worked. His parents separated and he moved between living with his mother and his father and at one stage was housed in a boys' home after being labelled as uncontrollable. He received no real guidance from his parents as he grew up and commenced to use drugs, starting with cannabis, but soon progressed to heroin.

22He has had a heroin addiction for many, many years. Of course the circumstances in which a person becomes addicted to drugs are important in deciding the extent to which that addiction can be treated as a mitigating factor when they commit offences to obtain money for drugs. The offender is not some rich kid who started using drugs while attending dance parties at a fashionable nightclub. To the contrary, the offender is a person whose use of drugs was to some extent inevitable given the way that he was brought up.

23Another of the challenges that Mr Genua faced, which no doubt had a devastating effect upon him, was that he was sexually assaulted when he was about twelve years of age and in his mother's care.

24He has committed a number of other offences in the past and served sentences in prison. During one of those times in prison he was sexually assaulted again, this time as an adult. As a result he is now on protection. I will take into account that there is a risk he will serve the remainder of his sentence on protection, and there is also a risk that that will involve harsher conditions of custody than would otherwise be the case.

25As I trust I have made clear I am satisfied that Mr Genua is genuinely remorseful, both as regards the effect of his offences on the many victims of his crimes, but also as regards the effect of his offending on those close to him.

26Although he has spent most of his life in gaol he commenced a relationship with a lady in 2007. They had one child and she had three children from a former relationship. However, since the offender returned to custody that relationship is no longer on foot. She has visited him only once and provided him with an ultimatum which has impressed upon Mr Genua the need to change the way that he has been living his life up until now. 

27Consistent with his remorse he has pleaded guilty. His pleas of guilty to the 2011 matters were made at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I will impose upon him for those matters will be twenty-five per cent less than they would otherwise have been. The pleas of guilty to the earlier matters were late, but nevertheless there was a utilitarian value attached to them and so I will discount the sentences I would otherwise have imposed for those matters by ten per cent. 

28The offender's desire to rehabilitate is, I am satisfied, genuine in the extreme, but as he well knows, as do I, that rehabilitation is not going to be easy. As he explained in his evidence he has difficulty coping in the community. One of the ways that he responds to stress in the community is to use drugs, he knows that this must change. 

29The principle of parity obviously applies so Mr Genua should not have any justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentences I impose upon him with those I impose upon his co-offenders. On the other hand, of course, he committed the 2011 offences alone so that must be borne firmly in mind. Another factor concerning parity is that when I sentenced Mr Skinner I did so on the basis that he had abandoned the conspiracy before he was arrested, that is, he had given up on the idea of committing the offence and was heading home. Mr Genua told police on his arrest that he was heading home but did not give evidence that this meant that he had abandoned the idea of continuing on with the plan to commit the offence at some later time.

30I now turn to look at Mr Hardy. Nathan Hardy is now thirty-seven years of age. His involvement in criminal activities began when he was but thirteen. What led to him starting a life of crime at that young age was probably a combination of factors flowing from a single source, namely, his father's behaviour. Mr Hardy's father was violent, drank to excess and committed crimes. In those circumstances Mr Hardy was often unsupervised as a child. His mother did her best, but times were tough. Having watched his father bash his mother unconscious on several occasions it is not surprising that he would occasionally stay with friends or live on the streets. Whether he was at home or elsewhere criminality was a normal state of affairs for him.

31It is not only Mr Hardy who has responded to those conditions by committing criminal offences, all four of his siblings have spent time in custody for their offending. He gets on well with almost all his brothers and sisters. His poor relationship with one brother arises out of the following circumstances, he had been in a de facto relationship with a woman for twenty years and, they have two children together. However, whilst he was in custody in 2009, his partner began a relationship with his older brother. Upon his release Mr Hardy was told that their relationship was over. This led to what a psychologist described as a decline in his psychosocial functioning and it was during this time that he committed the offence for which he must be sentenced.

32Mr Hardy has also had a significant level of problems with drugs. He started with cannabis and speed at twelve, commenced drinking alcohol to excess at thirteen and began to use heroin at the age of seventeen. On occasions he has used other drugs as well such as cocaine. In common with many offenders who are no longer young men Mr Hardy has found his time in custody on this occasion harder than it has been in the past. He is disappointed that plans which he had for his son to live with him had been thwarted by his current period in custody and told his psychologist that his son was angry at him for wrecking the plans that had been made.

33Mr Hardy denies his guilt and so does not express his remorse for his offending on this occasion. Notwithstanding that, there are some prospects of the offender rehabilitating himself, but it has to be said they are guarded given the level of his abuse of drugs and the regularity of his prior offending. Clearly, upon his release from custody Mr Hardy will need an extended period of supervision on parole in order to assist him to gain community living skills and to deal with his difficulties with drugs.

34It is unfortunate that Mr Hardy has spent so long in custody before being sentenced. The psychologist's report suggests the referral to the Compulsory Drug Treatment program would assist Mr Hardy's rehabilitation. However, given the length of time remaining in Mr Hardy's nonparole period, which I will shortly announce, he does not qualify for a referral. Of course it would be quite wrong for me to extend the period of Mr Hardy's incarceration simply to get qualified for a referral.

35Would you stand up please, Mr Hardy. Mr Hardy is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of three years to date from 12 November 2009. I set a head sentence of five years. Mr Hardy is thus eligible to be released to parole very shortly on 11 November 2012. 

36Have a seat, Mr Hardy.

37In the case of John Genua I propose to impose an aggregate sentence. The sentences I would have imposed for the individual offences are as follows: The offence of conspiring to commit a robbery, four and a half years.
For the offence of robbery of Ms Stevenson, three years.
For the offence of steal from a person concerning Ms Lois, two years.
For the offence of steal from a person Belinda Donovan, two and a half years.
For the offence of take and drive a conveyance, eighteen months.

38The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a nonparole period of four and half years with a period of eligibility for parole of three years, making a total sentence of seven and a half years. That is to date from 10 December 2010. Thus Mr Genua will be eligible to be released to parole on 9 June 2015.

		04 April 2013",2012-11-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760360,R v Landini; R v Camilleri [2012] NSWDC 229,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Most offenders appearing for sentence in these courts are young men, some of whom commit crimes regularly until, perhaps because they reach a level of maturity, perhaps because they are tired of the way they are wasting their lives in gaol or perhaps for other reasons they finally give up their lives of crime. The two offenders for sentence in this case are not in that category. Mr Camilleri is fifty-two, while Mr Landini is even older, sixty-eight. Both have lengthy criminal histories and both have spent considerable time in gaol. They appear for sentence today having each pleaded guilty to offences arising from their involvement in serious drug trafficking. Indeed the maximum penalty for the offences to which they have both pleaded guilty is life imprisonment. Mr Landini also appears for an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon. These offences carry standard non-parole periods. I have taken into account the standard non-parole periods as well as the maximum penalties in determining the appropriate sentences. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole periods in any case are to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

2A task force was set up to look into the activities, amongst others, of these two offenders in September 2009. No offences however appear to have been committed until two people acting at the direction of the police, known as AP1 (or authorised participant one) and AP2 (or authorised participant two) approached Camilleri seeking to purchase amphetamine. Over the next few months, 1.345 kilograms of that drug was supplied in a number of separate transactions. AP1 first approached Camilleri in late June 2010. He had a number of other meetings with Camilleri relating to the supply of drugs until, on 10 August 2010, Camilleri supplied AP1 with a sample and discussed the price which would be charged for larger amounts of amphetamine as well as the procedure by which that sale would be conducted. 

3It was Camilleri's practice to limit his physical contact with the drugs. He therefore needed others to do some of the dirty work for him. One of those was Landini, although to describe him as a mere foot soldier would be to underestimate the level of his involvement. 

4It is not of course necessary in these remarks on sentence to describe precisely how the various drug transactions took place. The statement of facts tendered in each offender's case goes into some considerable detail as to who did what and when they did it. It is sufficient in the present circumstances for me to simply note that on 19 August 2010 447.5 grams of amphetamine was supplied for $35,000. On 2 September 2010 449.3 grams of amphetamine was supplied for $45,000. On 17 September 448.7 grams of amphetamine was supplied for $45,000 and both offenders were ultimately arrested on 8 December 2010. They have remained in custody ever since. 

5I found that Camilleri's criminality in these offences was greater than that of Landini. Camilleri's approach appears to have been consistent with the understanding of the usual drug supply hierarchy as discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tyler v R [2007] NSWCCA 247; (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 and R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247 where those higher up in the hierarchy limit their contact with the drugs, getting others to do the physical work involved in the acts of supply. Camilleri put a number of people between him and the drugs, in particular of relevance in this case, Landini and another offender whom I sentenced earlier, Christine Franklin. On one occasion, the 2 September supply, Ms Franklin was not involved and it was Landini who carried out the role she had carried out on other occasions. This is consistent with Camilleri being the principal offender in this operation with Landini playing less of a role. 

6But it is important to note that Landini engaged himself in a number of aspects of the transactions which are often performed by principals, including making arrangements with the ultimate supplier Santino Dibella. I accept the Crown's categorisation of the different roles. Camilleri was slightly higher in the drug supply hierarchy than Landini. That is consistent with the Crown's decision to charge Landini with the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of the drug and Mr Camilleri with the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity. 

7I mentioned at the outset of these remarks that neither of these offenders is a young man. Mr Camilleri was raised by his parents in the Newtown area. His father appears to have been a violent man, who used alcohol regularly. He left home at thirteen after being severely beaten by his father. He was in Grade 8 at the time and gave up going to school as well. As a result he has had difficulty with reading and writing for most of his life. Indeed it is only of recent times he has been able to improve his literacy and his numeracy. 

8As I mentioned earlier he has served time in gaol before, including for offences of drug supply. However there is a significant gap in his offending. In 2003 he got a job with a man by the name of Peter Kay. He was conducting a business described as car pawn broking and Mr Camilleri performed a security and general hand role. He was earning money. He bought a house and entered into a mortgage on the understanding that his employer would not only pay him but also meet the mortgage payments. However the business got into trouble in 2009 and by the following year Mr Camilleri's financial position was desperate. He was going backwards in his mortgage payments and things got so bad that the gas and electricity were cut off. He gave evidence that he was particularly concerned at losing the house as it was the only substantial measure of security that he had known in his life. It was in these circumstances that he said that he gave into the temptation to supply drugs for money when he was approached by a man who, unbeknownst to him, was acting at the direction of police. 

9He gave evidence that he was in a relationship with a woman by the name of Jacqueline Briggs. She also gave evidence confirming what Mr Camilleri said. Mr Camilleri appears to have been a good partner and surrogate father to Ms Briggs's son Lazarus, who suffered a significant brain injury in a car crash in 2005. The relationship continues despite Mr Camilleri being incarcerated. 

10Mr Camilleri now expresses his remorse at what he has done to Ms Briggs and Lazarus. He understands that he has only got himself to blame and regrets what he has done. He hopes to better himself in custody, which he has been doing, and open up a chicken shop on his release. 

11It is of course not Mr Camilleri's fault that his naivety was taken advantage of by Peter Kay. The evidence would tend to suggest that Mr Camilleri was getting his life back on track, working in a legitimate occupation and having a happy family life until his financial circumstances became such that he risked losing the only real financial security he had ever known. That of course may explain but scarcely excuses what he did. The offence he committed was seriously criminal. 

12Consistent with his remorse he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. I will therefore discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. 

13It is important to take account of the significant gap between the offender's, last offence which appears to have been sometime around 1997, and 2010 when he committed this offence. A gap of thirteen years does demonstrate that there is hope for the offender's rehabilitation. I cannot say that his prospects of rehabilitation are good or that he is unlikely to offend in the future. I am confident that the sentence I will shortly impose upon him will act as a significant deterrent. The offender will find his time in custody as a fifty-two year old much different to his time in custody when he was a younger man. 

14As I mentioned before Mr Landini is now sixty-eight. The experience of gaol for him at his age will also be considerable indeed. A significant part of Mr Landini's case on sentence concerned the unfortunate position of his daughter Alexis and his partner, Ms Carmen Toosh. Alexis has a number of difficulties in life, including cerebral palsy. For many years the offender's son Daniel, one of Alexis's brothers, was her major carer, having taken over this role after their mother passed away. However Daniel suffers from polycystic kidney disease and he now requires dialysis. He has thus been forced to relinquish his role of caring for Alexis and so it was the offender and his partner who were to take over. Despite the offender knowing how important it was that he be able to care for his daughter, he committed these offences. It is somewhat unpalatable that the offender asked to have his sentence reduced on the basis that his daughter and partner would benefit from him being free in the community when it was his deliberate misconduct, his deliberate decision to commit these most serious offences, which has led to him being unable to provide that assistance. Nevertheless, consistent with the authorities, I find that the offender is entitled to a modest reduction in the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon him because of the hardship which will be experienced by his daughter Alexis through the offender's incarceration. That hardship goes beyond what is normally consequent on a father being incarcerated. The evidence was that Alexis is quite a different person when her father is around to care for her. 

15Of course the offender will do his time in custody harder than most. He knows that it is his own criminal offending which has led to his daughter and partner being deprived of the support that he would otherwise offer them. He is now an old man doing time in prison, which is an environment suitable at most for tough young men. On top of that his health is not as good as it was when he was serving prison sentences as a much younger man.

16The offender was born in Italy but came to Australia with his mother as a young boy. He was raised in Woolloomooloo and has worked in many and varied positions over the years. He has had a drug problem along the way and has abused alcohol from time to time. He served time in gaol, some of it for things which he did not actually do, (Mr Landini being the victim of corrupt police officers exposed by the Police Royal Commission) but plenty of it was for things which he did do. His most recent sentence was imposed in 2001 when he was dealt with for drug supply. He too has expressed his remorse and pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity entitling him to a twenty-five percent reduction to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. 

17I should note also that the offender is to be sentenced for an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon. To say that the details of that offence are sketchy is something of an understatement. All I know is that when he was arrested police discovered a thrust knife or push dagger. This is not otherwise described. There is no suggestion that the weapon was used in any way in the commission of any offence or that it was used by Mr Landini as he involved himself in these acts of drug supply. If the prosecution wants a judge to impose a significant sentence for an offence of this kind, it is incumbent upon them to explain in a bit more detail the criminality of that offence. 

18I note also that another thing found the offender was arrested was a very small quantity of cannabis. His possession of that drug appears on a Form 1. Given the huge disparity between the substantive offence of large commercial drug supply and the matter on the Form 1, I can confidently say that the offender will receive no extra punishment because of the offence on the Form 1.

19In relation to both offenders I take into account a number of relevant circumstances. It is important to note that these drugs, fortunately, never made it to end users. The drugs were seized by police and will be destroyed. The harm caused by an offence is an important aspect of assessing its gravity and so, because this offence caused less harm than would be the case if the drug reached end users, that circumstance should be reflected in the appropriate sentence. I take into account also that the purity of the drugs was relatively low. It was highly unlikely that the drugs would be further diluted. Offenders who supply quantities of drug with higher purity, other things being equal, commit more serious offences than those who supply drugs of low purity. 

20This offence involved multiple acts of criminality; to state the obvious there was more than one act of supply. The quantity involved was not significantly greater than the minimum which takes the offence into the large commercial quantity range. Many supplies involve much higher quantities of drug and much greater amounts of money. This is not a case where the offenders appear to have voluntarily given up their drug supply activities before they are arrested. To the contrary what appears to have brought to an end their activities was the intervention of police and their arrest and incarceration. On the other hand it appears to have been the involvement of the police which led to the drug supply activities starting in the first place. 

21In both cases I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. Neither of them is young, both have proved they are capable of going for some years without offending and it is in both their interests, as well as the community's that they be given as much assistance as possible upon their release from custody. 

22The sentences I impose are as follows.

23Mr Landini would you stand up please. For the offence of possessing a prohibited weapon I impose a non-parole period of one year with a head sentence of two years, to date from 8 December 2010. For the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of amphetamine the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four and a half years and a head sentence of seven and a half years, to date from 8 December 2010. The non-parole period will thus expire on 7 June 2015 which is the first date on which Mr Landini is eligible to be released to parole.

24Mr Camilleri would you stand up please. Mr Camilleri the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five and a half years with a head sentence of nine years, to date from 8 December 2010. Mr Camilleri's non-parole period will thus expire on 7 June 2016 which is the earliest date on which Mr Camilleri can be released to parole.

		22 January 2013",2012-11-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2760362,Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Garling J.
2McCALLUM J: I agree with Garling J that the appeal should be dismissed. 
3I would respectfully add that, whilst the brevity of his Honour's ex tempore reasons precludes any certainty in this respect, it is possible that his Honour's reference to the prior conviction, coming as it did in the context of a reference to ""the principles enunciated in Whyte"", was merely intended to refer to the fact that the applicant, as much as anyone, must have been well aware of his responsibility not to drive in the circumstances. In my view it was open to the learned sentencing judge to conclude that the applicant's decision to drive in the circumstances adverted to in the remarks on sentence revealed an abandonment of responsibility. 
4I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J.  
5GARLING J: At about 10.30pm on 19 December 2009, Odin Gommesen, the applicant, was driving a borrowed Holden Commodore sedan north along Duranbah Road, Duranbah in northern NSW.  
6His vehicle left the road and hit a power pole on the side of the road.  The front seat passenger, Mr Myke Rudd, who was the applicant's half-brother, was killed.  
7The applicant first entered a plea of guilty to an offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, before the Lismore Local Court on 18 January 2011, when he was committed for sentence.  The applicant adhered to his guilty plea to that offence when the proceedings came before the District Court (Black DCJ) for sentence in June 2011.
8The indictment which was presented in the District Court on 17 June 2011, contained a single count.  It was:
""For that he on 19 December 2009 at Duranbah in the State of New South Wales did drive a motor vehicle, namely a Holden Commodore Sedan, registration number 514-LQZ (Qld), whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor, where the prescribed concentration of alcohol was present in [his] blood, and whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Myke Rudd was occasioned.""
9The Crown accepted before Black DCJ, and his Honour found, that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the offences in circumstances which entitled him to ""the full 25 per cent discount in relation to his plea of guilty"". 
10An offence against s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
11On 17 June 2011, the applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months, commencing on that day and concluding on 16 December 2013.  
12The applicant now seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence.  He submits that the sentence was attended by error in two respects, and that a reduced sentence ought be imposed by this Court.  
13For the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that, whilst leave to appeal ought be granted, the applicant's sentence ought not be reduced.  The appeal ought be dismissed.
Facts and circumstances14The Crown and the applicant agreed on a Statement of Facts, which was tendered to the sentencing Judge.
15Relevantly, the agreed Facts included the following:
(a)at around 5pm on 19 December 2009, the applicant was at his residence at Kingscliff in company with his partner's brother.  They were drinking beer.  Shortly before 6pm the applicant and his partner's brother drove to a friend's house where they stayed for half an hour or more during which time the applicant continued to drink beer;
(b)at around 6pm, the applicant drove himself and his partner's brother to a party in Duranbah Road, Duranbah.  There were about 30 people at the party including the deceased, Myke Rudd.  The applicant drank an unknown quantity of alcohol while at the party, and left some time prior to 10.30pm;
(c)a witness outside the front of whose home the accident occurred, was awoken by the sound of a large car engine coming down the hill, with a car travelling in a northerly direction along Duranbah Road.  She heard the sound of a motor vehicle accident outside her house.  The power to her house was lost;
(d)when she left her home, having called the Emergency Services, she observed a blue sedan facing south on the side of the road, having hit the power pole at the front of her house;
(e)the applicant was seen to be sitting upright in the driver's seat of the vehicle, having sustained a large cut to the middle of his forehead, and to be bleeding heavily.  As the applicant got out of the vehicle, he went to walk off, but could not stand up and ended up leaning against the car;
(f)a search was conducted in the vicinity of the collision for the deceased.  His body was located down an embankment about five metres away from the vehicle.  It was apparent that he had died having been ejected from the vehicle;
(g)the roadway was generally in a good state of repair, but was damp due to recent rain.  All of the damage to the motor vehicle was to the passenger side door and body.  There was little, if any, damage to the driver's side of the vehicle;
(h)the investigating officer, having looked at the motor vehicle and the tyre marks on the roadway, concluded that the vehicle had been travelling in a north-westerly direction along Duranbah Road and, after negotiating a sweeping left hand bend, travelled upon a straight section with a slight downhill gradient.  The nearside wheels of the vehicle then left the bitumen roadway to the left and travelled along the unsealed edge of the road;
(i)shortly afterwards the applicant lost control of the vehicle and it began to slide across the single northbound lane and then the single southbound lane in a right arc.  The vehicle slid for approximately 56 metres, with the near side of the vehicle leading, before colliding with the power pole on the opposite side of the road;
(j)the applicant was taken to the Tweed Heads Hospital for treatment, where a blood sample was taken.  On analysis the sample was found to contain a blood alcohol content of 0.172 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood;
(k)a report to police by Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist, expressed the opinion that the applicant was under the influence of alcohol to the extent that his driving ability would have been very substantially impaired;
(l)when asked by police about the accident, the applicant told them that he could not remember who had been driving the vehicle at the time of the collision or anything about the collision at all.
16The party which the applicant was at, before getting into the motor vehicle immediately prior to the collision, was being held in the same street in which the collision occurred.  The house at which the party was, and the house outside which the collision occurred were about 40 street numbers apart.  The applicant's evidence was that the accident occurred about 200m from the house where the party was and that he was driving home when the collision occurred.  His home was about 7 kilometres from Duranbah.
17The applicant's evidence before Black DCJ was that he had no memory of the accident at all.  However, in cross-examination this question was asked of him, and he gave this answer:
""Q. So you would have appreciated that when you actually got into the car at the party to leave, that you were really, really drunk?
A. Yes. Too drunk to know what I was doing.
Q. That's right?
A. Yes.""
18It is clear that the area in which the collision occurred was a remote area with some, but not many, houses in the vicinity and a low level of traffic on the road.  
Grounds of appeal19The grounds relied upon by the applicant are as follows:
""The learned sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in that his Honour:
(a) erred in his assessment of the seriousness of the applicant's driving; and
(b) had improper regard to the applicant's prior criminal record.""
20In support of these grounds, the applicant submits that an assessment, by the sentencing Judge, that his moral culpability was high, was based on three essential findings, namely:
(a)that the applicant was seriously affected by alcohol which was evidenced by the shortness of the distance before the accident;
(b)that the applicant had a prior conviction for drink driving; and
(c)that there were two passengers in the vehicle.
21The fact that the sentencing Judge had regard to the two passengers being in the motor vehicle is not, and cannot be, the subject of any criticism.  It is a proper circumstance for his Honour to have taken into account.
22However, the applicant submits that the first two bases identified in [203] are erroneous or irrelevant findings and as a consequence, the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was in error.
23In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the sentencing Judge concentrated on, as does the Notice of Appeal, the moral culpability of the applicant.  Although this is not the only factor relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, in the circumstances of this application for appeal, it is significant.
Seriousness of the alcohol effect24In his submissions, the applicant accepts that he had a blood alcohol reading of 0.172, which formed the basis of the charge of aggravated dangerous driving, and, further, that it was not in issue that his ability to drive the motor vehicle was substantially impaired as the Statement of Facts records.  The applicant accepts that he was at greater risk of being involved in an accident as a result of this level of intoxication.  
25However, he submits that the trial Judge's conclusion that his degree of impairment could be observed from the short distance over which he drove before the accident happened, was erroneous.  
26In order to consider this submission, it is necessary to note some of the matters to which his Honour referred in his Remarks on Sentence.  
27He firstly noted the important features from the Agreed Statement of Facts, including that it was within a very short distance of the applicant leaving the party that the accident happened, and that the applicant's blood alcohol content was 0.172.  He also noted Dr Perl's opinion.  
28He then turned to and carefully considered some subjective matters involving the adverse effects which the accident had had on the applicant and the applicant's family.  His Honour then assessed the extent of the applicant's moral culpability, and said this:
""Well, as far as assessing the moral delinquency of this, I think it is fair to describe it as high, the reasons are these, and they really boil down to two reasons; the brevity or shortness of the distance before the accident happened illustrates of itself in my view, how seriously he must have been affected, the other matter is that in 2008 he was convicted of a significant drink/driving offence in Queensland and was disqualified for a period and that, coupled with the fact that there were when he left this party, two passengers in the car, not just the deceased and himself, that brings the clear operation of the principles enunciated in Whyte where the moral culpability is high.""
29Although his Honour commenced with the expression ""moral delinquency"", it is clear that he was considering moral culpability.
30The need for a determination by any sentencing Judge of the extent of an offender's ""moral culpability"" is seen to arise from the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [229]-[230] where Spigelman CJ said:
""The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and s 52(3) of the Crimes Act for the typical case ... should be: 'where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full-time custodial ... sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) ... would not generally be appropriate'.  In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will of course, be appropriate.""
31The degree of moral culpability is ""a critical component of the objective circumstances of offence"": Whyte at [205].  There are differing degrees of moral culpability arising from the particular facts of an offence, which range from low moral culpability, such as momentary inattention, to a high moral culpability, described as an abandonment of responsibility: R v Errington [2005] NSWCCA 348; (2005) 157 A Crim R 553 at [27] per Mason P; R v Gonzales [2006] NSWCCA 4 at [12] per Basten JA.
32There is a high degree of moral culpability displayed where there is present to a material degree, one or more of the aggravating factors articulated in Whyte.   
33The list of aggravating factors to which Spigelman CJ drew attention in that judgment, were as follows:
66 ""(i) extent and nature of the injuries inflicted;
(ii)number of people put at risk;
(iii)degree of speed;
(iv)degree of intoxication or of substance abuse;
(v)erratic or aggressive driving;
(vi)competitive driving or showing off;
(vii)length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk;
(viii)ignoring of warnings;
(ix)escaping police pursuit;
(x)degree of sleep deprivation;
(xi)failing to stop.""
34One of the aggravating factors referred to in Whyte:
""(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk""
is relevantly a question of assessing the intended journey and not just the journey attenuated by the collision: R v Takai [2004] NSWCCA 392; (2004) 149 A Crim R 593 at [39] per Simpson J.  
35The applicant's submission in short, on this ground, is that the fact that there was only 200 metres or so between when the applicant left the party and the collision occurred, was not a fact which of itself and without more, supported the conclusion expressed by the sentencing judge that the applicant was seriously affected by his alcohol consumption.
36The applicant submits that there are likely to be many causes of the accident which remained unexplored by the agreed facts and in the evidence, any of which may explain the happening of the accident.  Since, so it is submitted, that is so, the conclusion expressed by the judge that the reason for the accident happening so quickly was the extent of applicant's impairment caused by his intoxication, was not reasonably open.
37It is necessary, in considering these submissions, to keep in mind, as this Court has often said, that it is inappropriate to take an overly critical approach to reasons contained in ex tempore judgments.  What is relevant is the substance and essence of the Judge's remarks, rather that the result of any exercise of parsing and analysing closely, in an unduly technical way, the words and phrases used in the Remarks on Sentence.
38Here the sentence was imposed, and the Remarks made, on the same day as the submissions were made.  No doubt, his Honour dealt with other matters in the list on that day.  In these circumstances, applications for leave to appeal are unrewarding if they concentrate on the felicity of expression rather than the substance of the Remarks. 
39The applicant submits that because, commonly, accidents such as the one in this case leading to the offence, are multifactorial, the relatively short distance over which the applicant could not support the finding of substantial impairment.  However, this is not a factor to be viewed in isolation.  The Judge was told, and it was agreed, that the applicant's capacity to drive the vehicle was substantially impaired.  This agreed fact is corroborated by the fact that within a few hundred metres of commencing the homeward journey, the applicant had lost control of the car and it collided with a power pole before he could regain control of it.  The agreed facts did not record any agreement as to the speed at which the car was travelling.
40The evidence which formed a part of the agreed facts from Dr Perl, was of general application, and related to the objective fact of the applicant's blood alcohol level: that is, a reading of 0.172 meant, of itself, that the applicant's ability to drive a motor vehicle was substantially impaired.
41However, that agreed opinion did not relate to any specific evidence about, or any detail of, the actual driving by the applicant.  As it seems to me, against the background of that evidence, what his Honour was doing in the passage to which I have referred at [28] above, was to find corroboration for that expert opinion in the facts of this particular accident.
42It appears that his Honour has concluded that the fact that the accident happened very soon after the applicant started his journey, that is, about 200 metres or so, demonstrated that his ability to drive the motor vehicle was, in fact, substantially impaired.  There was no other explanation proffered by the evidence that might explain this very early loss of control.
43In my view, this was an inference which in the context of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this accident, was well open to his Honour.  I can detect no error in this conclusion.  
Prior criminal conviction44The second basis upon which the applicant submits the sentence ought be set aside, is that the sentencing judge impermissibly took into account the applicant's criminal history.  
45The relevant entry in the applicant's criminal history was his offence of being convicted in June 2008 in Mt Isa, of driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of alcohol when his reading was 0.094.  
46The Facts Sheet for that offence which was tendered without objection to the sentencing judge, records the following brief facts:
""At approximately 12.30am on Saturday 21 June 2008, police from Mt Isa Police Station were conducting mobile patrols within Mt Isa. ... police observed a white Holden Commodore sedan ... at the intersection of Sutton and George Streets.
The Police were approximately 60 metres from the sedan when it was at the intersection.  Police observed the rear wheels of the vehicle spinning and large amounts of grey smoke coming from the vehicle.  The vehicle then began to travel in an easterly direction on George Street.  Police then activated their lights and sirens in an attempt to intercept the vehicle as it was doing a burnout.  
Police intercepted the vehicle on George Street...
The defendant provided no emergent reason or lawful excuse for driving the vehicle in the manner observed by Police.""
47The finding that the applicant was driving in Mt Isa whilst over the limit, needs to be considered in the context of what he was doing at the time he was observed by police, namely, doing a burnout on a public street in Mt Isa whilst apparently on his way home after visiting a friend.
48As is apparent, the incident referred to happened about 18 months before the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced.  It had nothing to do with the applicant's conduct at the time of the offence for which he was being sentenced.
49The central element of moral culpability relates to the facts and circumstances of the offences itself, and where relevant, the facts and circumstances leading up to the offence, where those facts and circumstances have relevance to the commission of the offence.
50In imposing a sentence, a person's prior criminal history and past convictions are relevant: see s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999.  But the prior criminal history has no role to play in determining the objective seriousness in all of the circumstances of the offence: Veen v R (No.2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [24] per Spigelman CJ, at [63] per McClellan CJ at CL, at [76] per Grove J and at [81] per Barr J and Bell J, see also Howie J in R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193.
51Although the sentencing judge's conclusion was expressed by reference to moral culpability, to the extent that it included any references to the prior criminal record, it was erroneous.  
52To that extent, the applicant's second ground of appeal succeeds.
53But there remains a question of whether this error has resulted in the finding that the applicant's moral culpability was high with respect to the offence also being erroneous.  On all of the evidence appropriately to be take into account, I am not satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated that such ultimate conclusion was in error.
54The finding that the applicant's moral culpability was high is well supported by the material before the sentencing judge, including:  
(a)the applicant's blood alcohol reading was 0.17, which, whilst it was marginally above the level required for the aggravated component of the offence, is nevertheless more than three times the legal limit;
(b)as the Statement of Agreed Facts made plain, the applicant's capacity to drive a motor vehicle was substantially impaired; 
(c)the applicant set out with an adult male passenger and a juvenile male passenger, having been drinking for over five hours, to drive a seven kilometre journey in order to get home;
(d)the vehicle was travelling at an excessive speed as is demonstrated by the following:
(i)the description of the events given by the witness outside whose house the collision occurred, was consistent with a car travelling with a degree of speed.  The witness was awoken by the sound of a loud car engine coming down the hill; 
(ii)the deceased, Mike Rudd, was ejected from the motor vehicle and found about 5 metres from it.  This is consistent with a degree of speed.  
(iii)the major damage to the rear nearside door when it collided with the power pole, was also consistent with a degree of speed;
(iv)the car skidded for about 56 metres after the applicant lost control.
55In those circumstances, the finding that the degree of moral culpability involved in this offence was high, was plainly open to his Honour.  I detect no error of the kind the applicant submits is to be found in his Honour's ultimate conclusion and would reject this ground of appeal.  
Section 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 191256Even though I am satisfied that the finding of the applicant's moral culpability as being high was the correct conclusion, albeit reached by an erroneous path of reasoning, it is necessary for this Court to consider whether any lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
57In my opinion it is not.  The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 year imprisonment.  The offence was objectively serious and the applicant's moral culpability was high.  He was a man with a previous offence for driving with an excessive quantity of alcohol in his blood.  He knew that he was ""... really, really drunk"" and stated he was ""too drunk to know what [he] was doing"".  He knew that he should not be driving a motor vehicle at all, let alone with two passengers, one of whom was a juvenile under his supervision.
58Subjectively, the applicant was remorseful and had recognised the nature of his crime.  He had accepted his responsibility for it.  Particularly because the deceased was his brother, the probabilities are that the adverse effects of the offence will stay with him throughout his life.  Upon release from custody, he will have the benefit of family support.
59It is also necessary to keep in mind that the applicant pleaded guilty at an early stage and was entitled to the maximum discount of 25 per cent.  As well, a finding of special circumstances was made.  It is not suggested that this should be disturbed.  
60The applicant's sentence of 4 years in total and 2 years and 6 months by way of a non-parole period is within the broad range of penalties imposed for offences of this kind.
61I detect nothing in any of the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence, and the applicant's subjective case which could lead to a conclusion that a lesser sentence was warranted.  Ultimately, the seriousness of the offence, the loss of a life, and a finding of a high degree of moral culpability, all combine to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was a proper one, and no lesser sentence is warranted.
Summary62Although the sentencing judge's ultimate conclusion that the degree of moral culpability was high was a correct one, he followed an erroneous pathway to reach that conclusion.
63Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal.  However, for the reasons I have expressed, I would dismiss the appeal.
Orders64I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.(2)Appeal dismissed.

		02 November 2012",2012-10-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760365,Police v DG [2012] NSWChC 18,"Judgment

1The Young Person, DG, was charged with the offence of larceny. It is alleged that on 22 September 2011, he stole property to the value of $500. The matter was listed for hearing before the Children's Court of NSW on 27 September 2012. The Young Person maintained his plea of 'Not Guilty' and the Prosecution sought to withdraw the charge.

2Objection was taken to the withdrawal of the charge by the Young Person's legal representative. It was submitted that the Court should exercise its ""common law discretion to refuse to allow the Prosecution to withdraw the matter"". The effect would be that the Prosecution would be required to ""offer no evidence"" and that the matter would be dismissed by the Court. It was not submitted that the withdrawal of the charge would be an abuse of process, but rather that it would be unfair to the Young Person if he was to be exposed to the possibility of having to face the same allegation at a later time. The Defence submitted that the Supreme Court case of Evans v DPP [2000] NSWSC 1005, provided authority for the Defence submission.

3The Prosecution indicated that it sought to withdraw the proceedings pursuant to s 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986; and did not seek to ""offer no evidence"".

4The case of Evans v DPP related to a criminal matter which had already commenced as a hearing, in the sense that some evidence had been heard before the Local Court. It was also a matter that attracted the procedural provisions of the Justices Act 1902. The Justices Act has now been repealed and largely replaced by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
In Evans v DPP, his Honour, Justice James noted at paragraph 45:

""Although the power to give leave to an informant to withdraw an information still exists, where a hearing of the information has commenced, a magistrate may be less likely to exercise the discretionary power in favour of the informant, if the hearing of the information has commenced. If the hearing has commenced and it has become apparent that the evidence of the prosecution is incapable of establishing the offence charged and if the defendant opposes the giving of leave to withdraw the information, then a proper exercise of the magistrate's discretion may require the magistrate to refuse to give leave to the informant to withdraw the information. A defendant may oppose the giving of leave to withdraw the information, because the defendant wishes to obtain the benefit of an order of the magistrate dismissing the information, which would in turn empower the magistrate to make an order for costs in favour of the defendant.""

5In Lay v Cleary and Anor (1992) BC9303691, the charges against Mr Lay were withdrawn by consent. (It would appear that the Prosecutor was not prepared to ""offer no evidence"" as the complainant was available but unreliable and reluctant to give evidence). After the proceedings were withdrawn, counsel for the accused sought a costs order from the Court. The magistrate refused the application, indicating that the Court had no power under the provisions of the Justices Act 1902, if the matter had been withdrawn, rather than dismissed.

Section 80 of the Justices Act 1902 at that time stated:

""After hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and the evidence adduced, the said Justice or Justices shall consider and determine the whole matter, and convict or, make an order upon the defendant or dismiss the information or complaint, as the case may require.""

Section 81, stated:
"".....that a Justice in the case of an order of dismissal may order that the prosecutor pay to the Clerk of the Court to be paid by him to the defendant such costs as to the Justice seem just and reasonable.""

6It would appear that the issue of whether or not a Magistrate had an implied discretion arose as there was ""no power expressly conferred by the Justices Act to give leave to an informant to withdraw an information. On the contrary, a Justice when exercising summary jurisdiction is required by s77 and s 80 of the Justices Act where both parties appear and there is no question of any adjournment, to hear and determine the matter and either to convict the defendant or dismiss the information."" (Lay v Cleary at page 19.)

7At pages 23 and 24 of his Honour's judgment in Lay v Cleary refers to the following:

""A power in a Magistrate to give leave to an informant to withdraw proceedings, although not expressly conferred by statute, has been recognised in England. In Regina v Phipps, which I have already referred to, the facts bear a strong resemblance to the facts in the present case. Lord Parker CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed said: ""...it is common knowledge that process is allowed to be withdrawn in many cases where the prosecution do not desire to proceed, and in my judgment where withdrawal in that sense takes place, that is to say where the prosecution is allowed to withdraw process before, in the case of a trial, the trial is started, and in the case of an inquiry, before the inquiry has begun, there is then no provision in the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1952, which will enable the accused to recover costs. Having said that, I would like to add that the position is not as bad as it would at first appear, because it is always a matter for the discretion of the court whether it allows the process to be withdrawn. There are a number of factors which would enter into the consideration preceding the exercise of the discretion. There would, in the case of a summary trial, be questions such as: are all the defendant's witnesses here? Is the nature of the offence such that the defendant should be acquitted, which will prevent further proceedings being brought, whereas a discretion to allow process to be withdrawn will not amount to an acquittal? There is also the consideration, arising from what I have said, that the defendant may have incurred costs and desire to recover those costs, or have an opportunity of recovering those costs which he will not have if the summons is withdrawn.""

8After considering a number of authorities, his Honour Justice James stated at paragraph 30 of his judgment:

""I conclude that a Justice has an implied discretionary power to grant leave to an informant to withdraw an information charging an offence punishable summarily, at least where the informant applies for leave to withdraw the information before any hearing has commenced.

I do not consider that it is unjust to a defendant for a Magistrate to have such a power. If an application for leave to withdraw an information is made to a Magistrate, the Magistrate should ask the defendant whether he consents or objects to the informant being given leave to withdraw the information. It is open to the defendant to tell the Magistrate that he objects to leave being given. If the defendant tells the Magistrate that he objects to the informant being given leave to withdraw the information, that will be a very material factor for the Magistrate to take into account in deciding whether to exercise his discretionary power in favour of giving leave to the informant to withdraw the information. If the defendant objects to the informant being given leave to withdraw the information and particularly if the defendant says that he wishes to apply for an order for costs, the Magistrate must take into account that if he grants leave to the informant to withdraw the information, the Magistrate will have no power to make an order for costs in favour of the defendant.

The granting of leave to an informant to withdraw an information will not necessarily be inimical to the interests of the defendant. A defendant who thinks that he is at some risk of being convicted if there is a hearing, may prefer to have the information withdrawn, even though he does not obtain an acquittal and cannot obtain an order for payment of his costs. If the information is withdrawn the risk of his being convicted on that information is eliminated and it may be practically certain that no further information will be laid. If the defendant objects to leave being given to withdraw the information, there may be a risk from the defendant's point of view that the informant will prefer to proceed and endeavour to obtain a conviction, rather than offer no evidence and incur an order for costs.""

9In the present case, this Court has proceeded on the basis that the argument raised by the Defence did not seek to raise future issues in relation autrefois acquit, but simply that it would be unfair if the Young Person's matter was not determined to finality at this time.

Under the Justices Act, the withdrawal of an information did not involve an order of dismissal of the information and a fresh charge for the same offence may have been open to the prosecuting authorities. A number of authorities have addressed these issues. See Broome v Chenoweth 1946, HCA, BC4600060, Willis v Magistrates' Court of Victoria, 1995, BC9606097, DG of Fair Trading v O'Shane 1996, BC9703791, Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Au, [2005] NSWCA 119.

10It would appear that whilst the Defence argument may be somewhat beguiling, it does not properly state the current applicable statute law.

11Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 deals with 'Summary Procedure'.

Section 170 applies ""to or in respect of proceedings for summary offences, including proceedings for indictable offences that are being dealt with summarily."" The charge against the Young Person falls within this definition of an indictable offence being dealt with summarily. Proceedings are now commenced ""by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice"".

12Part 2, Division 3 deals with Trial Procedure in the Local Court. 
Section 192(1) states that:

""If both the accused person and the prosecutor are present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of proceedings for an offence (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned) the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter"".

Subsection 3 provides for an adjournment of the proceedings, if appropriate.

13Section 202(1) states:

""The court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with this Act.""

14Section 205 states:

(1) ""A court may make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed if it decides to dismiss the matter.
(2) ""A court must make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a mater has been dismissed if requested to do so by an accused person against whom a matter has been dismissed or by the prosecutor.""
(3) ""This section does not apply to a matter that is taken to be dismissed because of s 208.""

15Section 206 states:

""A certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed, if produced and without any further proofs being required, prevents any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person.""

16Section 208 states:

(1) ""If a matter is withdrawn by the prosecutor, the matter is taken to be dismissed and the accused person is taken to be discharged in relation to the offences concerned.""
(2) ""The dismissal of a matter because of its withdrawal by the prosecutor does not prevent any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person.""

17It appears that there was no equivalent provision to s 208 in the repealed Justices Act.

The legislative intent of s 208 appears to have been to provide a statutory basis for the withdrawal of matters by the prosecution, rather than an implied discretion to allow the withdrawal of a matter, as had been the case implied under the Justices Act and interpreted by case law.

The purposive use of the words ""taken to be dismissed"" and ""taken to be discharged"" suggests that this section does not require the court to exercise any discretion to effectively dismiss the matter. The withdrawal of the matter deems that to have occurred on the withdrawal by the prosecutor.

18In DPP (NSW) v AB [2008] NSWSC 115, his Honour Justice Adams stated:

""It is clear that s208 specifies a mandatory course in the event of the withdrawal of a matter by a prosecutor. The deemed dismissal of the charge and discharge of the accused person in relation to the alleged offence occurs by virtue of the section. Further action by the Magistrate or the court is unnecessary and can add nothing to the effect of the withdrawal."" Para 11.

19The Second Reading Speech relating to ss 205, 206 and 208 on 7 November 2007, contains the following statement by the Hon. Penny Sharpe:

""I deal firstly with the issue of double jeopardy raised by Ms Lee Rhiannon. The amendments merely clarify that the withdrawal of the matter by the prosecution does not prevent later proceedings in respect of the same matter against the same person. The double jeopardy principle has never been intended to apply to such matters; it being predicated upon there being an acquittal, generally following a hearing on the merits of the case...The concern arising from these sections is that matters can be withdrawn for technical reasons unrelated to the prosecution forming the view that the prosecution is doomed to fail. This amendment does not affect the other safeguards in the law such as applications for stays due to unfairness; statutes of limitations for bringing summary offences, generally six months,; and arguments relating to abuse of process, all of which continue to ensure that this particular provision is not unfairly misused.""

20The other issue that caused considerable consternation under the Justices Act, related to the issue of costs. As referred to above, if the matter was withdrawn but not dismissed, a costs remedy was not available to the accused.

21Sections 212 and 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act remove any concern that costs are not available if the prosecution withdraws a charge pursuant to s 208.

Section 212 states:
212(1) A court may award costs in criminal proceedings only in accordance with this Act.

Section 213 states:
213 (1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.
213 (2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable.
213 (3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because:
(a)the prosecutor fails to appear or both the prosecutor and the accused person fail to appear, or
(b)the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.
Professional costs are defined in s 211 as meaning ""costs (other than court costs) relating to professional expenses and disbursements (including witnesses' expenses in respect of proceedings before a court.""

22The Criminal Procedure Act does not specifically allude to the situation where the prosecution concedes that they cannot proceed as their case is ""doomed"" and they therefore seek to ""offer no evidence."" In Broome v Chenoweth, (1946) HCA, BC4600060, Justice Dixon referred to a matter where the prosecution had unsuccessfully sought to have the matter withdrawn and where no evidence was offered and the papers marked ""Dismissal for want of prosecution"". His Honour continued, noting:

""What is material is that defects existed in the information which made the prosecutor unwilling to proceed and that the ground of the dismissal was his failure further to prosecute it. The expression in the minute ""want of prosecution"" was used to mean the failure of the informant to support the information though appearing before the court, not his failure to appear. It is not an expression with any distinct meaning or consequences in proceedings before justices. It is not a term of art or a recognised form of judgment, like a judgment of nonsuit, of non pros, or a judgment after a nolle prosequi before verdict, well understood at common law to amount to a termination of proceedings without an adjudication and creating no bar to a subsequent suit. There is, therefore, nothing in the terms in which the minute is framed to prevent the order of the magistrate operating as such a discharge of the defendant from the earlier information as to bar any subsequent proceedings for the same offence.""

23An analogous situation to the above under the Criminal Procedure Act would be one where the prosecution proceeds pursuant to s 202, rather than s 208. If the prosecution proceeded under s 202, conceding that it could not succeed at any time, the Court could grant a certificate pursuant to ss 205 and 206.

The construction of s 205 would appear to require the court to provide a certificate if the court ""decides to dismiss the matter."" This could encapsulate a matter where the prosecution conceded that their case must fail; and the matter is dismissed prior to hearing.

The certificate must be granted if requested by either the accused person or by the prosecutor. Such a certificate would make it clear that no further proceedings could be brought by the prosecution. (See s 206).

24A different interpretation to paragraphs 22 and 23 above, may be interpreted from the case AB v DPP (NSW) and ANOR [2008] NSWCA 91; where his Honour Justice Handley stated at paragraph 10 and 11, (referring to s 202 (1) and (2)):

""This indicates the nature of the order of dismissal referred to in s 205 (1). In the present case the Children's Court did not make ""an order of dismissal"" and did not ""decided to dismiss the matter. There was no trial, no evidence and no adjudication.

A dismissal under s 208 does not flow from any order or decision of the court. It takes effect automatically on the withdrawal of the case by the prosecutor.""

25In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Au [2005] NSWCA 119, the Court of Appeal considered a matter which was originally before the Local Court and dismissed by consent under the Justices Act. The matter was appealed to the Supreme Court before his Honour Justice Shaw who determined that there had been a 'hearing' as he considered that ""although...there had been no hearing on the merits because the procedural course taken was by consent. He considered that as the parties had appeared with their legal representatives and put to the Magistrate what they desired to do and say, that was sufficient to constitute a hearing and the fact that no witnesses were called was legally irrelevant.""

26The need for a hearing relates specifically to the issue of issue estoppel or autrefois acquit. For a plea of autrefois acquit to succeed there must have been an acquittal on the merits. The accused person must have been ""put in jeopardy on the prior (earlier) charge"". This may require further clarification by a superior court or by legislative amendment.

27The question whether the matter is dealt with pursuant to s 202 in terms of ""offering no evidence"" and s 208, where the matter is withdrawn, may rely on the prosecutor's discretion. Both provisions empower the court to award costs against the prosecutor, as referred to above.

Clearly, the Second Reading Speech made it clear that other safeguards available to the court ""such as applications for stays due to unfairness"" are not affected by the amendments to the Act.

28The defence submission in this case relied on the implied jurisdiction arising from the Local Courts Act and referred to in cases such as Lay v Cleary. With the provisions referred to above, particularly s 208, the Local Court and the Children's Court have been provided with an express jurisdiction arising from the statute known as the Criminal Procedure Act.

The court retains an implied jurisdiction which ""will arise upon the principle that a grant of express power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise. Recognition of the existence of implied powers is called for whenever they are required for the effective exercise of a jurisdiction which is expressly conferred but are confined to so much as can be derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction."" See Director-General of Fair Trading v O'Shane, 1996, NSWSC, BC9703791.

29In DPP (NSW) v AB [2008]NSWSC 115, Justice Adams commented at paragraphs 15 and 16:

""the effect of s 208 is to render any decision by the Magistrate supererogatory and, indeed, was outside the Court's jurisdiction. To my mind, the better interpretation of what the Magistrate did was simply to note the papers with the effect of s 208 so it would be clear, if anyone needed to consider the papers, that the matter had been dismissed.......it is obviously desirable that, where magistrates do note a dismissal and discharge pursuant to a withdrawal, the papers specifically refer to s 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 so that any officer of the court who finds it necessary to consult the papers will understand immediately what the actual position was.""

30The Prosecution are entitled to withdraw the larceny charge against the Young Person.

That charge is taken to be dismissed and the young person is taken to be discharged in relation to that charge.

31An application for costs was made and not opposed by the prosecution. Costs in the sum of $825 are awarded, pursuant to s 213.

2760377,R v Pattalis [2012] NSWDC 10,"SENTENCE
1HIS HONOUR: Alex Pattalis appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty to an offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm. The circumstances in which the plea was entered will require a little bit of examination later on in these remarks on sentence. 
2The offence occurred when, for reasons which have not been identified, the offender decided to hit the victim, a man by the name of Christian Thompson, with a solid punch whilst they were both waiting out the front of a nightclub. No explanation has been offered as to why Mr Pattalis would have done that. I simply do not know whether he was out for a violent night, whether there was some level of provocation or what. What I do know is that nothing could possibly justify what Mr Pattalis did. It was, I repeat, a single but forceful punch which caused Mr Thompson to fall to the ground. Mr Pattalis left the vicinity soon afterwards and people came to assist Mr Thompson. He was taken to hospital after there were significant concerns raised about his condition by those who saw him after he had been punched. The injuries occasioned to Mr Thompson were significant. They are set out in a victim impact statement. Nor is it the case that he has made a full recovery. For example, he has physical deformities. He has pain when flying when the aircraft he is in descends to land and he has of course the obvious and almost inevitable emotional consequences that flow from being the victim of apparently random violence such as occurred to him.
3The offender was brought up by his father after his mother apparently abandoned the relationship she had with his father. He left school and began working as a labourer. He was quite a good rugby league player apparently and was employed in that occupation for a number of years but had to retire following an injury. He is now working part time with his sister who runs a fitness centre. He is apparently good at his job and a letter from his sister was tendered to me today. As well as that he looks after his grandmother following the death of his grandfather a short while ago. He has used alcohol in the past but not drugs. He told a Probation and Parole officer that he did not consider he had an alcohol problem despite bouts of heavy drinking, but did say that he reduced his drinking following his arrest to an occasional social drink. 
4It appears that the most that can be said to explain why this offence occurred was that the offender was drunk at the time. That may have caused him to act out of character and may be a factor in assessing the prospects of the offender's rehabilitation but they do little to reduce the objective gravity of what the offender did. 
5It appears that he did act out of character this evening, at least while sober. The Probation and Parole report says that Mr Pattalis presents as a young man of normal stable habits with a noteworthy sporting background whose commission of the offence appears to be out of character. The only qualification to that concerns the offender's prior criminal history which includes within it an offence of common assault which cannot have been the most serious common assault because he got a s 9 bond for it but nevertheless there is a criminal history which involves one offence of violence. Unfortunately no details could be obtained about this because he told the Probation and Parole officer that he had no memory of his offending behaviour, something he also claims as regards the present offence.
6I said I would speak about the circumstances in which the plea of guilty was entered. He was originally charged with a more serious offence, recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm but offered in the Local Court to plead to assault occasioning actual bodily harm which is the offence for which he is to be sentenced today. However that offer was rejected by the Crown. 
7Ordinarily that would mean that I would discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twentyfive per cent, but the Crown tells me that the offer to plead to the less serious offence was a conditional one, it being conditional on the Crown accepting the factual basis for the sentence, which the Crown would not accept. It was in those circumstances that the plea was only entered after committal for trial to this Court. In those circumstances the discount will be less than the twenty-five percent. I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. This is a matter that could have been dealt with in the Local Court, so I will take that into account.
8I note that there has been some delay. The offence was committed on 1 May 2010, and it was not for some time that the offender was arrested. Why that would be I do not know. The offence was captured by CCTV footage, and the nightclub had a practice of recording the driver's licence, or other forms of identification, of all its patrons. It cannot have been that difficult therefore to find Mr Pattalis, but he was not charged for some time. Following that there had been a further delay, before today, arising out of the circumstances, I have just explained.
9One of the important matters concerns the issue of the principle to be found in De Simoni v R (1981) 147 CLR 383. Although the offender was in company at the time he is not charged with any offence involving him being in company, and so I have ignored that aspect of the facts tendered today. More difficulty arises from the extent of the injuries, which were suffered by Mr Thompson. They were, as I have said, quite serious, however that does not mean that I will be taking into account a more serious offence. I will not be sentencing the offender as though he had committed the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm.
10Following the fairly recent decision in Blackwell v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 93; 208 A Crim 5 392 the mental element in that offence, at the time this offence was committed, is an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. I will not sentence the offender on the basis that he had such an intention. I will, however, take into account the full extent of the injuries suffered by Mr Thompson in assessing the appropriate sentence.
11The offender has expressed some remorse, and there are prospects for his rehabilitation. Given that there is no real explanation for the offence in the first place it is difficult to assess how good those prospects for rehabilitation are. The sentence that I am about to impose upon will have a significant effect upon him, and so one aspect in assessing the risk of re-offending is the personal deterrent aspect of the sentence I am shortly to announce.
12Of course the steps by a judge in assessing an appropriate sentence are, firstly, to consider the form of that sentence. Imprisonment is very much a sentence of last resort, but I am satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate. I will be soon talking about the need for general deterrence, that is a very important aspect of deciding that imprisonment is required. It is then my task to assess the length of that sentence, and, if the sentence is of an appropriate length, whether there are any alternatives to full time custody which are appropriate.
13Mr Lowe impresses upon me the outcome which would see his client receive a suspended sentence of imprisonment. In my view that would be insufficient to deter others who may be tempted to act in the way that Mr Pattalis has acted. You do not have to be a judge, or involved in the criminal law, to know that there is a growing problem of drunken violence. People are entitled to go out and have a drink without the risk of being punched by young men. People are entitled to walk along the street without being injured in a significant way, as Mr Thompson has been. It cannot, of course, also be overlooked that on occasions a single punch, such as Mr Pattalis inflicted on Mr Thompson on this occasion has led to death, and manslaughter charges. That is fairly common enough occurrence. For those reasons a significant sentence is required which contains within it a substantial component of general deterrence, and in my view a suspended sentence is insufficient to do what is required.
14The offender is therefore sentence to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of one year, and a head sentence of two years, to date from today, 2 November 2012. The non-parole period will expire on 1 November 2013, on which day the offender is to be released to parole.
15LOWE: I'm obliged to ask would your consider a home detention assessment before that--
16HIS HONOUR: No, for two reasons. One, I do not think that is appropriate, and secondly, eighteen months is the cut-off for home detention. So I am not going to do that.
17The special circumstances are the youth of the offender, and this being his first time in custody.

2760417,Allan - Application for Inquiry into Conviction and Sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001 [2012] NSWSC 1596,"DECISION
1HIS HONOUR:  Mr Stephen John Allan has applied for an inquiry into convictions recorded against him at the Downing Centre Local Court on 15 November 2010.  He was convicted of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence (s 114 Crimes Act 1900) and three offences of assault (s 61 Crimes Act).
2The convictions followed a defended hearing before her Honour Barkell LCM.  Mr Allan was represented by Ms Daniels of counsel and the prosecution was represented by a police prosecutor, Sgt Arnold.
3Her Honour convicted Mr Allan on all four counts.  For the s 114 offence she ordered that he enter into a good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and for each of the offences of assault imposed a fine of $400 with court costs of $79.
4Mr Allan appealed to the District Court against his conviction.  The appeal was heard by his Honour Judge Finnane QC on 28 March 2011.  Mr Allan represented himself on this occasion.  The prosecution was represented by a solicitor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Mr Allan was granted leave to tender further documentary evidence.  He made submissions to which the prosecution solicitor was not called upon to respond.  The appeal was dismissed and the convictions and sentences were confirmed.  
5The application is brought pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  The relevant provisions are to be found in s 78 and 79.  The terms of those provisions, together with a summary of principles that apply to the making and consideration of such an application, were usefully set out in detail in the judgment of Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 at [4]-[19].  I have had regard to those provisions and principles and there is no purpose to be served by restating them here.  
6The prosecution case was, in very broad terms, that on the evening of Saturday 27 March 2010 at about 9.15pm Mr Allan approached a sex worker, Ms Ashley Montabello, in the vicinity of Bourke and Burton Streets in Darlinghurst.  He sought to engage her services but did not have sufficient money and was rebuffed.  
7Ms Montabello said that after she turned the man down, he remained standing near her being a nuisance.  She could smell on his breath that he had been drinking.  She asked him to move on but he did not and she formed the view that he was scaring her potential customers away.  
8Two youth workers approached the scene, Ms Hannah Jamal and Ms Zoe Humphreys.  Ms Jamal knew Ms Montabello and heard her say to a man standing nearby, ""I said no"".  Ms Jamal thought this was unusual and called Ms Montabello over.  Ms Montabello told her that the man had been hassling her and would not leave her alone.  Ms Jamal went over to the man and told him to move on or else she would call the police.  She said that he started screaming at her so she stepped back.  The man then grabbed her by the arms and shoved her backwards twice.  She stumbled backwards and then ran back quickly to Ms Montabello and Ms Humphreys.  She said the man was screaming obscenities.  Ms Jamal also smelt that the man had been drinking but said that he appeared to be walking alright.
9 When Ms Jamal rejoined Ms Humphreys and Ms Montabello the man turned and walked away along Bourke Street towards William Street.  Ms Jamal rang the police on her mobile.  At some point the man turned and started to return quickly to the three women.  As he approached it was observed that he had a knife in his hand.  The three women then ran.  There was evidence that the man chased the women up and down Bourke Street.  Ms Jamal was still on the phone to the police while this occurred and reported that the man had a knife.  The police upgraded the urgency of their response and uniformed police officers were soon in attendance.  The man was seen to turn into Burton Street and that fact was drawn to the attention of the police.  When the women turned into Burton Street they observed that a man had been apprehended.  Ms Jamal said that she pointed at the man and said to the police, ""That's him.  That's him.""  
10Constable Julie Moulden was one of the first officers to arrive.  She said that she was flagged down by Ms Jamal who said, ""he went that way,"" and ""he was wearing a blue long sleeve shirt, black long pants and he was old"".  Constable Moulden looked along Burton Street and saw Mr Allan, who she did not at that point know, wearing the clothing that had been described walking away from Bourke Street.  She said that there was no one else around who remotely matched the description.  The police vehicle was driven up to Mr Allan and stopped.  The officers alighted and Mr Allan was asked if he had a knife.  He responded, ""Yes, I do, a Swiss Army knife.  I carry it all the time with me.  It's in my right pocket.""  Mr Allan was searched and a knife was found in his pocket and he was arrested.  When cautioned Mr Allan said, ""I haven't done anything wrong.  Those girls were harassing me."" 
11Mr Allan gave evidence.  In broad terms his version of events was that he had caught a bus to Darlinghurst from Double Bay at around 9pm, after consuming about six beers.  He was walking along Bourke Street about 30 metres south of Williams Street when he was approached by a woman who threatened him by saying, ""my friends are going to mug you and do you over if you walk up Bourke Street"".  He told her to leave him alone and took a few steps back.  The woman approached him again and so he pushed her away from him by her shoulders to keep her at arms length.  He said to her, ""I'm not going to be intimidated by you or your friends because I'm carrying a Swiss Army knife.""  The woman remained undeterred and asked him to show her the knife.  Mr Allan said, ""I took her threats very seriously because I've had previous experiences in the area of armed robberies, criminal groups like this who operate not individually, but in gangs, and so I chose to show her the knife to, because I thought that it would, it would diffuse a more dangerous situation because she would've been aware that her gang could not be able to intimidate me and would be more than likely to not approach me as I walked up Bourke Street.""  
12After showing the woman the knife, Mr Allan said that she turned and jogged towards a group of women about 50 metres away.  There were three other women there.  The woman had a brief discussion with them and they walked off towards Oxford Street.  Mr Allan said that he continued on his way up Bourke Street and turned into one of the streets on the left at which point he was arrested.  
13Mr Allan's case in the Local Court and on appeal in the District Court was not to deny that there had been an incident such as was described by the three women.  Rather it was a denial that he was the man involved.  For example, in her closing address Ms Daniels said, ""It is clearly the defence case that the three complainants were assaulted in the manner described on 27 March of this year.  It was not Mr Allan who was the perpetrator.""  
14The learned Magistrate concluded that Mr Allan's explanation ""seems to me totally incredible and I do not accept [it]"".  His Honour Judge Finnane, although expressing himself in different terms, clearly came to the view that Mr Allan's account did not represent a reasonably possible version of events.  
15It is immediately apparent from the foregoing summary of the competing cases that there were significant problems for Mr Allan in persuading a court to accept his version.  He would have it that there were two incidents in Bourke Street Darlinghurst at the same time, both involving a man in a long sleeved blue shirt, both involving that man pushing a woman in the upper torso, and both involving that man being armed with a small bladed knife.  There was the further coincidence that both men then walked into Burton Street.  But the police only found Mr Allan there; no one else remotely matching the description given by the complainants was seen.
16Mr Allan has formulated six ""Grounds for Inquiry and Appeal"" and I propose to deal with each of them.
Ground 1:  A wrong decision of a question of law had been made by the court by giving greater weight and credibility to the testimony of an accuser that that of the defendant in an issue of fact about an alleged relationship.
Fresh conclusive evidence is also available.
17The ground is concerned with evidence given by Ms Montabello.  Towards the end of her cross-examination by Ms Daniels, it was suggested that the man she was talking about was not Mr Allan.  Ms Montabello responded, ""Yeah, it was him.  I seen him a couple of times.  I seen him before as a client.""  Ms Daniels did not challenge that evidence.  In re-examination Ms Montabello explained that she had seen Mr Allan in the past, ""a couple of times actually"".  She referred to him having a car.  She elaborated that she had talked to him for about five minutes on one occasion and on the other occasion she had sat talking with him in his car for about 15 minutes.  I note that no further cross-examination was sought.
18Mr Allan gave the following evidence:
Q. Now, in court, you may have heard Ms Montabello state that she's met you before the incident on 27 March this year.  Now, what do you have to say about that?A. It is a possibility because my understanding is that she's a street walker and at the time of the incident, I was a local resident for six years and do walk up Bourke Street fairly regularly simply because it's a main pedestrian route in the area.  I do see and can recognise quite a number of the street walkers but I don't recognise her.
19The evidence of Ms Montabello on this subject was not referred to at all and appears to have formed no part of the Magistrate's reasoning.
20In the hearing of the appeal in the District Court, Mr Allan was permitted to tender a letter from the Roads and Traffic Authority which indicated that he had never been recorded as the ""operator of a vehicle in New South Wales"".  Finnane DCJ did not regard that as a matter of any significance as it did not indicate anything about Mr Allan having access to vehicles.
21In the material annexed to his application for an inquiry Mr Allan has included that letter from the RTA, as well as the lease for the premises he was renting at the relevant time in Elizabeth Bay and a letter from City of Sydney Council indicating that he had not been issued with any parking permit.  It was submitted that this evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that he had not been in a car with Ms Montabello and that she had ""given false evidence in an attempt to convict an innocent person"".
22In my view this evidence does nothing to undermine the credibility of Ms Montabello.  It says nothing about whether Mr Allan ever had access to or use of a motor vehicle in the past.  The point is, in any event, of relatively slight significance in the assessment of the overall effect of the evidence of the three complainants.
Ground 2:  Findings of the court about the perception of the defendant's hair colour are scientifically incorrect.
23This is a reference to the evidence of the three complainants which was to the effect that the colour of the man's hair was grey.  It seems to have been common ground that when he appeared in court his hair was a reddish blond colour.  Within the material annexed to the application there is a photograph of Mr Allan said to have been taken several months before the incident which shows that his hair was a reddish colour rather than grey.  Also attached is a document of a scientific nature dealing with the basic concepts of lighting.  
24The issue as to the description of the man's hair colour, grey according to each of the complainants but apparently in reality a reddish colour, was considered by both the Magistrate and the judge on appeal.  Both dismissed it as having no significance given that the observations were made at night with street lighting.  The material now provided does not raise anything of significance in relation to this issue.
Ground 3:  The court made a wrong decision of a question of law in allocating criminal intention to the lawful possession of a Swiss Army knife and moderate intoxication.
25The submission in support of this ground is to the effect that Finnane DCJ erred in rejecting a submission that no motive to commit the offences had been established and that there was no basis to conclude that his intention in possessing the pocketknife was to commit an offence.
26This is a matter which was considered by his Honour and rejected.  That rejection was open to his Honour and this ground is insignificant.
Ground 4:  Important evidence was withheld by the prosecution resulting in a substantial miscarriage of justice.
27Mr Allan submitted in support of this ground that there had been ""a substantial miscarriage of justice"" because a police recording of the triple 0 call made by Ms Jamal had been ""withheld by the prosecution"".  
28It is the case that there was evidence in the cross-examination of Constable Moulden that triple 0 calls are routinely recorded.  She said there was ""no reason"" why a recording of the call had not been produced.
29It is a matter of sheer speculation that the recording, assuming it still exists, would contain material that would be in conflict with the evidence given by any of the complainants.  It is also of some significance that no attempt has been made by or on behalf of Mr Allan to have a copy of the recording produced.  It is also of some significance that the nondisclosure of a recording of a triple 0 call was not the subject of any submission made by counsel for Mr Allan in the Local Court.  There was no suggestion of any unfairness.  There is no merit in this ground.
Ground 5:  The findings of the court as to the credibility [presumably of the complainants] cannot be supported by the evidence resulting in an unreasonable and unsupportable verdict.
30A variety of matters were raised by Mr Allan in support of this ground.  I have given consideration to the submissions and the evidence to which they relate.  I do not intend to refer to any of them individually.  
31It is significant that many, although not all, of these matters were raised in either the Local Court or the District Court of both.  Some of the points that are now raised were matters that could have been the subject of cross-examination if counsel thought they were significant.
32I note that in the course of her closing submissions Ms Daniels said that she agreed with the prosecutor's characterisation of the complainants' evidence.  She said, ""they were forthright and I would have to concede that it is entirely open for your Honour to accept their evidence.""  The prosecutor's submission had been generally to the effect that each of the complainants had given honest and credible evidence.
33The Magistrate noted the concession by the defence of the complainants having given credible evidence.  Clearly she was of the view that their evidence should be accepted notwithstanding some differences in their recollections.  Finnane DCJ came to the same view, saying ""each of those women gave evidence and gave it in what appears to me to have been an entirely credible way.  The fact that there were differences between them is of no importance, because human beings will always differ when they given evidence of things that have happened to them, that is a common human experience"".
34Having considered each of the matters raised in the submissions by Mr Allan under this ground, both individually and in their cumulative effect, I have no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion of the Magistrate or the judge on appeal.
Ground 6:  The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence because the case for the prosecution has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the case for the defence has been proved on the balance of probabilities.
35In support of this ground Mr Allan referred to some of the points that he had raised earlier in his submissions.  There is no additional material relied upon.  This ground does not add any force to his application.
CONCLUSION
36Having considered all of the material provided in support of the application, including Mr Allan's submissions, I am of the view that there is no doubt or question as to his guilt in respect of any of the offences for which he was convicted.  I have no unease or sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand.  I decline to direct an inquiry be conducted or refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
37The application is refused.

		20 December 2012",2012-11-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760420,Norman v R [2012] NSWCCA 230,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: Following a trial in the District Court before a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted on three counts of sexual intercourse without consent (Crimes Act 1900 s 61l). The offences were alleged to have occurred during the course of the appellant's marriage to the complainant. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to an overall term of imprisonment of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years and six months.

2The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence, on the following grounds:

""Appeal against Conviction

1. The trial judge erred in declining to admit evidence of a 'gang rape' of the complainant.

2. 'Relationship' evidence should not have been admitted.

3. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the appellant 'laughing'.

4. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at the trial of fresh evidence.

Appeal against Sentence

1. The sentences are manifestly excessive"".

3For the reasons given below, I consider that, whilst his other grounds of appeal fail, the appellant has established, under Ground 2, that certain relationship evidence should not have been admitted. However as I consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. Furthermore, as I do not consider that the sentences imposed upon the appellant are manifestly excessive, his application for leave to appeal against those sentences should also be dismissed.

THE CROWN CASE AT TRIAL

4The complainant gave evidence that during the course of her 13 year marriage to the appellant, commencing in 1995 and ending in 2009, she and the appellant had anal intercourse five times, but only twice with her consent. The complainant's evidence concerning the three non-consensual incidents, the subjects of the charges against the appellant, were summarised by the Crown on appeal as follows:

""i) 20 September 2002: Count 1: The birthday incident so-called because it occurred on the appellant's birthday.
The incident began with consensual vaginal intercourse. Then the appellant wanted to have anal intercourse and the complainant said 'no'. 'He had lowered his penis down to my anus. As soon as he did that I said 'no', I said 'no, I don't want to'. And he had turned around and he had made the comment that it would only take a minute from there. He started inserting it into my anus and I said, 'stop'. I turned around and I was trying to push him off me and I was saying, 'stop, no, it's hurting'. I was trying to push him on his chest to push him up off me. Once he ejaculated he'd stop. He withdrew his penis from my anus and from then I got up and I got dressed and I wanted to leave the premises. I actually went down to where my local shops is down the road and I sat behind the shops on the concrete and just cried. When I returned he asked me if I wanted him to leave and I said yes at the time. He did leave.'

ii) 2004: Count 2: 'The massage incident'. 
'I had been suffering from back pain ... Chris offered to massage my back so I laid on the bed. I didn't have clothes on. He got some oil and rubbed it onto my back ...At some point he started to insert his penis into my anus I said 'no' and I said 'stop' and I had actually tried to push my body upwards to try and get him to hop off me at the time. I'm sure that he had said that its okay and that he'll just be a minute ... I tried to push myself to get him off me and I was turning my head and saying no, stop. He continued until he ended up ejaculating again into my anus ... I had pain on the left side of my stomach. I got dressed and went out on to the veranda to have a cigarette.'

iii) 2005: Count 3:
'What had happened in 2005 was that Chris and I had gotten into bed and tried to be intimate and again we started to have vaginal sex and from there again he had stopped and slid his penis down to my anus and started to insert it and again I had said stop. He continued ... It wasn't that long. It was probably a couple of minutes or so. Yeah, it wasn't that long and then-and then he ejaculated into my arse and then, yeah, once he stopped, he hopped off ... I got dressed and went out for a cigarette'"" (Crown's Written Submissions [7], Transcript page references omitted). 

5At the trial the Crown also led evidence from four witnesses of admissions made by the appellant that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent. 

6Evidence of another witness, Ms Kelly-Anne Blinman, was summarised by the Crown as follows:

""It was the evidence of Kelly-Anne Blinman that she had been told about the happening of certain things in the marriage, and that there was a time in 2009 where there was a conversation in the garage when the complainant, who was upset and yelling, said to the appellant, 'If I don't satisfy you, you will just take it' (meaning sex). When asked if there was any response to this remark she said 'I believe Chris spoke. I cannot remember what he said, but I remember him laughing'"" (Crown's Written Submissions [8], Transcript page references omitted).

7The Crown also called evidence from three witnesses, two of whom had given evidence of admissions by the appellant, of complaints made by the complainant that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. 

THE APPELLANT'S CASE AT TRIAL

8Evidence given by the appellant at the trial included the following:

""Q. Okay. Now, can you tell the Court what your practice would be like before you would engage in any sexual intercourse. What things would you do?
A. I would ask her what she would like to do, whether she would like to have sex. I would talk to her about - okay, well, I wouldn't talk to her. I'd ask her, 'Do you want to have sex?'"" (Transcript p 405).

9On appeal, the Crown summarised the appellant's evidence concerning the three charges against him as follows:

""Count One
'A. As I explained before, we went to bed. It wasn't usual that we went to bed naked, due to our children, and our children were at my parent's house. So I asked her whether we could do anal. She said, 'No'. 'Vaginal?' She said, 'No'. She said yes to 'cheeky'. And we got into position for cheeky, which is on her hands and knees, and then I asked her again about anal and she said, 'Okay, just don't hurt me', and then I proceeded with the preparation of anal.'

He then admitted he had anal sex with her that night and said that at the conclusion that she 'got up out of the bed. I asked her if she [was] okay, which was a normal thing that I asked her, and she said 'yes'. She went out of the room and said she wanted to go for a walk, which was okay with me considering the circumstances of the relationship. And that was the last I saw of her until three hours later.'

He denied that the complainant had ever said words like 'stop' or 'don't' or '[it's] hurting' or anything like that, and he denied that she ever tried to push him off her.

Count Two
He said he could not specifically recall the incident she referred to. He did say that they had anal sex a great deal within the relationship so that he could not recall every time that he had anal sex with the complainant. He denied that there were any times during the relationship when she said 'no' to sexual intercourse but he went ahead and did it anyway.

Count Three
Again the appellant could not particularly identify this count because 'it's really difficult because we have anal sex so many times in our relationship to recall individuals - we would perform anal sex basically once a month'"" (Crown's Written Submissions [10], Transcript page references omitted).

10The appellant's summary of his evidence in his written submissions on appeal included the following:

""The appellant initially denied in cross-examination ever engaging in anal sex with her after she had said 'no' or 'stop'. However he modified this answer by saying 'sometimes we would continue, she would be all right with continuing'. Defence counsel had put to the complainant, presumably on instructions, that, on the occasions when she 'said no' to anal intercourse, the appellant 'only continued with your consent ... and that consent was either oral or by your body language'. The appellant claimed he often had anal sex with her consent although on the majority of occasions when he asked for anal sex she said 'no'. He denied ever admitting that he had 'raped' or 'sexually assaulted' the complainant except in a sarcastic way"" (Appellant's Written Submissions [8], Transcript page references omitted).

11The evidence referred to above in the second sentence of [10] was given in the following context:

""Q. Chris, during the times that you had anal sex with [the complainant] in 2004 was there any time where she said the words 'no' or 'stop'?
A. Yes.

Q. All right, and what happened when she said the words 'no' or 'stop'?
A. I stopped.

Q. All right. Were there any times where she said 'no' or 'stop' where you continued?
A. No.

Q. So when she says 'no' or 'stop', you say you stop.
A. Yes.

Q. Is that only in 2004?
A. No, that was the entire time we were performing anal sex, and sex.

Q. All right. So whenever she says something like 'no' or 'stop', is it your evidence you said you stop?
A. Yeah.

Q. And that's all the time?
A. Yes.

Q. Right, and what do you do after that, when you stop?
A. I talk with her on, 'What's the matter?' You know, 'Okay, what' - whether it was the position. I can't go into - okay. Just what was the issue and why did she say stop.

Q. All right. Now, after you talked to her, what happens then?
A. Sometimes we would continue, she would be all right with continuing. Other times she would not be all right with continuing and that would be over"" (Transcript pp 411 - 12).

GROUND ONE: THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN DECLINING TO ADMIT EVIDENCE OF A ""GANG RAPE"" OF THE COMPLAINANT

12At the trial the appellant sought to cross-examine the complainant about a gang rape of her by six men when she was aged 17, two years prior to her marriage to the appellant. The rape involved acts of anal intercourse. In a judgment published on 2 November 2010, the trial judge described the appellant's submissions and her Honour's response as follows:

""It is submitted on behalf of the accused that the complainant expressed a particular reluctance to engage in that form of sexual act with him because of what had happened when she was seventeen. After that disclosure, it is submitted for the accused, he would always be careful when having sexual intercourse with the complainant and would seek her permission both before and during sexual intercourse in regard to having anal intercourse or any sexual act at all.

...

It is contended on his behalf that the jury might find this strange or bizarre behaviour, that is, his seeking the permission of the complainant as the accused says he did on each occasion that they had sexual intercourse. Consequently, the jury might not accept his evidence as accurate if they are not to be made aware of the background and the reasons why he would ask, or be so careful to ask the complainant for her permission.

In my view, this evidence is not relevant to any fact in issue in the trial. On the Crown case there is no issue at all that he did not ask her about engaging in particular sexual activity when they had sexual intercourse. The complainant essentially agrees that is what would occur. I refer in that regard to the Crown case statement at paragraphs 5 and 9 and to the complainant's statement, particularly paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 13 and 28"" (Judgment 2 November 2010).

13On appeal, the appellant accepted that, as the trial judge said, it was not in issue at the trial that the appellant's practice was to seek permission before engaging in certain kinds of sexual activity with the complainant (Appellant's Written Submissions [13]). He did not renew the submission, rejected by the trial judge, that the evidence of the gang rape was relevant to explain what might otherwise be seen by the jury as ""strange or bizarre"" behaviour. The appellant submitted that the evidence was however relevant in other ways. 

14First, he submitted that it was relevant to show that the complainant was opposed to anal sex because of her memories of the traumatic gang rape. However why the complainant was opposed to anal sex was not in my view relevant when her opposition to it was not in doubt. 

15Secondly, the appellant submitted that the evidence was relevant to his state of mind as it showed that he was aware of the complainant's general reluctance to engage in anal sex. However, the evidence was not relevant on this basis either as there was no doubt of the appellant's awareness of this. 

16The appellant further contended that ""in circumstances where [the complainant] had been anally raped when an adolescent, 'sexual communication would at best be confused and confusing, and ... messages particularly if expressed ambivalently, might be misunderstood"" (Appellant's Written Submissions [16]). The appellant made this submission by reference to a report of a psychiatrist, Dr John Pickering, which the appellant sought to have admitted on appeal (as to which, see below [49]). In this context the appellant did not rely upon Dr Pickering's comments as evidence but ""as a useful guide to the relevance of the gang rape incident to the state of mind of the appellant"" (ibid). However, the point made by Dr Pickering does not in my view assist the appellant as on neither the appellant's nor the complainant's version of events were messages ""expressed ambivalently"". This is discussed further below at [53].

17The appellant also submitted that it was unfair to him for the jury to be left in ignorance of the gang rape incident in light of the following question put to the appellant in cross-examination by the Crown:

""In particular you asked her on one occasion whether she would want to have anal sex, and she said that she thought she might struggle with it physically and emotionally"" (ibid [18]).

18The appellant answered this question in the affirmative (Transcript p 421). The reason why the complainant ""might struggle"" with anal sex was not relevant when it was accepted by the appellant that that was the case. The absence of unfairness to the appellant is confirmed by his counsel's failure to put this submission at the trial. 

19Accordingly, I conclude that the trial judge was correct to regard evidence of the complainant's gang rape as not relevant to any issue in the trial and therefore to exclude it. 

GROUND TWO: ""RELATIONSHIP"" EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED

20On appeal the appellant challenges the trial judge's ruling of 26 October 2010 that evidence of (non-sexual) domestic violence between the appellant and the complainant should be admitted ""for the purpose of showing the relationship between the [appellant] and the complainant"". This decision was made by reference to a summary of evidence which was Exhibit 5 on the voir dire at the trial. 

21This summary included the following:

""The relationship between the complainant and the accused was a troubled relationship which included a lot of arguments. The complainant asserts that at times the accused was physically and verbally violent towards her.

On occasions when the complainant said she did not want to have sex the accused would say things like 'I might as well go and sleep with a prostitute'. The accused would talk about sex a lot, in front of others ... "" (Exhibit 5, paragraphs [2] - [3]).

22The summary also included reference to an incident in 1999 when the appellant was alleged to have slapped the complainant and kicked her after she fell to the ground, and to another in 2001 in which the appellant was alleged to have grabbed the complainant by the hair, dragged her into a bedroom and pushed his fingers into her throat.

23At the trial the Crown disclaimed reliance upon this evidence as indicating a propensity on the part of the appellant which rendered it more likely that he had committed the crimes with which he was charged. As a result, sections 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act were inapplicable, as was the test stated in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 concerning the admissibility of such evidence. 

24As pointed out in Roach v R [2011] HCA 12; 242 CLR 610, evidence which incidentally shows propensity but which is otherwise relevant will not be excluded provided that the jury is properly warned against its use as propensity evidence (see also BBH v R [2012] HCA 9; 86 ALJR 357 at [146] - [149]). 

25A basis upon which relationship evidence may otherwise be relevant is that it assists in the evaluation of other evidence such as that of a complainant, as it did in Roach v R which concerned charges of non-sexual domestic violence:

"" ... Here the complainant gave direct evidence both of the alleged offence and of the ""relationship"" evidence. The latter evidence, which included evidence of other assaults, was tendered to explain the circumstance of the offence charged. It was tendered so that she could give a full account and so that her statement of the appellant's conduct on the day of the offence would not appear ""out of the blue"" to the jury and inexplicable on that account, which may readily occur where there is only one charge. It allowed the prosecution, and the complainant, to meet a question which would naturally arise in the minds of the jury"" (at [42], citation omitted).

26In other words, relationship evidence may be admitted on the basis that, without it, the jury would be faced with a seemingly inexplicable or fanciful isolated incident. To enable complainants to give their account of events comprehensively, they must be permitted to place the incidents of which they complain in a meaningful context.

27In Wilson v R [1970] HCA 17; 123 CLR 334, the accused claimed that the discharge of a gun that killed his wife was accidental. There were no eye witnesses to the incident. Determination of the accused's guilt required an evaluation of his uncorroborated evidence that the gun had accidentally discharged while resting on top of a load of hay, shooting the victim in the back of the head as she was driving a tractor. The trial judge was held to have properly admitted evidence of the nature of the relationship between the accused and his wife. In a passage cited with approval in Roach v R (at [44]), Menzies J said:

""To shut the jury off from any event throwing light upon the relationship between this husband and wife would be to require them to decide the issue as if it happened in a vacuum rather than in the setting of a tense and bitter relationship between a man and a woman who were husband and wife. Accordingly ... the evidence in question was properly admitted because it was pertinent to the issues which the jury had to decide"" (at 344).

28As noted by Barwick CJ (at 337), the nature of the ""relationship between the applicant and his wife was relevant to the question to be decided by the jury. Evidence of a close affectionate relationship could properly have been used by the jury to incline against the conclusion, which might otherwise have been drawn from the circumstances, that the applicant killed his wife. Equally, evidence that there had developed mutual enmity could be used to induce the conclusion that he had killed his wife and that his story of an accidental shooting lacked credibility"".

29On a number of occasions this Court has however emphasised that it is necessary to consider carefully the basis upon which ""relationship"" evidence is relevant in a particular case (see Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 at [112]; DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 at [28] - [30] and RG v R [2010] NSWCCA 173 at [36] - [37]). In RG, for example, the basis of relevance was described as follows:

""The evidence of which complaint is now made, if believed, established a pattern of behaviour in which the complainant was relatively unsurprised by the conduct the subject of the charge, and made no response, nor any subsequent report. In that respect, it explains her behaviour, which may otherwise have appeared surprising and therefore implausible to the jury"" (at [38]).

30Evidence led from the complainant in chief at the present trial included the following:


The complainant and the appellant were married in 1995. 
The marriage lasted nearly 14 years.
Difficulties concerning their first child caused difficulties in their relationship.
There were two occasions upon which the appellant was violent towards the complainant (see [22] above).
The complainant and the appellant discussed anal sex ""off and on over a fair few years"" (Transcript p 52).
The complainant and the appellant argued more frequently after the birth of their second child in 2000, with a further deterioration after their third child was born in 2001. The complainant said that at that time ""[w]e were fighting a lot more, arguing"" and that led to the incident of physical violence in which the appellant put his fingers in the complainant's throat (see [22] above) (Transcript pp 54 - 55). 
The complainant gave evidence of the incidents which were the subject of the charges against the appellant.

31No evidence was led from the complainant that her responses to the appellant's desire for, or initiation of, anal sex with her were dictated, or influenced, by a fear of the appellant deriving from his prior physical violence. Nor did her evidence in cross-examination suggest that this was the case although she did say in relation to one instance of anal sex ""Well, I might as - he's going to take it anyway, so why not just give it to him"" (Transcript p 67). 

32Similarly, no evidence was led from the complainant to suggest that her failure to report the appellant's sexual assaults to the police prior to the end of their relationship was the product of fear deriving from the two incidents of violence. Nor did the complainant's evidence in cross-examination suggest this to be the case. The reasons she proffered for her delay were entirely different: fear of losing family support, self-doubt, religious beliefs and ignorance of the law (Transcript pp 72, 74). As a result, I reject the Crown's submission that the evidence of the appellant's violence towards the complainant was relevant to demonstrate why the alleged sexual assaults were not reported earlier (Crown's Written Submissions [17]). I note that the Crown did not rely in this context upon the police evidence that the complainant told police when she first reported the incidents that she did not do so earlier because:

""I was afraid that he would assault me. We've had a really violent relationship. He's hit me a few times"" (Transcript p 334).

33The Crown also submitted that the evidence was relevant to demonstrate ""the nature of the relationship"" (Crown's Written Submissions [17]) but, consistently with the approach taken by this Court in Qualtieri and DJV, it is insufficient to rely solely upon such a proposition. Evidence ""is not relevant merely because it discloses aspects of the relationship between an accused and a complainant. There must be an issue which the evidence may explain or resolve by placing the alleged events in their true context"": DJV per McClellan CJ at CL at [29]. Particularly because of its potentially prejudicial character, the precise basis upon which the evidence is relevant must be closely analysed. As indicated by McClellan CJ at CL in DJV, in many cases the evidence will be relevant to explain a lack of a timely complaint (at [28]) but, in light of the way the Crown put its arguments, the present is not such a case (see [32] above). 

34Nor can it be said that the evidence would have assisted the jury, in any permissible fashion, in evaluating the complainant's evidence. The evidence of the violent assaults was of two incidents occurring between one and six years prior to the sexual assaults. Whilst there were undoubtedly many arguments between the parties, the two physical assaults stood as isolated incidents, unrelated to the sexual assaults. Unlike the position in Roach and Wilson, it could not be said in the present case that the evidence of prior domestic violence was ""necessary to better explain the complainant's account of what occurred"" (BBH at [149]). The complainant's evidence of the sexual assaults had not been provided in a vacuum, but in the context of ""off and on"" discussions about anal sex throughout the course of their marriage. 

35Accordingly, evidence of the two isolated incidents of non-sexual domestic violence was not necessary to place the sexual assaults within a meaningful context. As the appellant submitted on appeal, it is difficult to see what, if any, use the jury could have made of the evidence other than to engage in impermissible propensity reasoning that the appellant was the type of man who might have sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent. Whilst the trial judge directed the jury not to reason in that way, there was unfairness to the appellant in the evidence being before the jury when it was not relevant on any basis.

36In my view therefore, the evidence of the two physical assaults by the appellant upon the complainant was not relevant (other than for the impermissible purpose of proving propensity or tendency) and should not have been admitted. 

37Although Ground 2 of the appeal therefore succeeds, I nevertheless consider that the appeal should be dismissed because ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"" (s 6(1) of Criminal Appeal Act 1912).

38In my view, the Crown case against the appellant was of such overwhelming strength that there is no significant possibility that if the evidence the subject of Ground 2 had not been admitted, the jury would have acquitted the appellant. Further, having reviewed the record of the trial to make my own independent assessment of the evidence, I consider that ""the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the [appellant's] guilt of the offence[s] on which the jury returned its verdict[s] of guilty"" (Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [44]; Patel v R [2012] HCA 29; 86 ALJR 954 at [120]).

39Of particular importance in this regard is the following evidence of admissions made by the appellant.

40First, Ms Marcia Grayson, a friend of the appellant, gave evidence that the appellant came to stay with her after the complainant had asked the appellant to leave their home. After a conversation with someone else, Ms Grayson asked the appellant if he had raped the complainant, to which the appellant replied that he had (Transcript pp 213 - 214). The appellant then moved out of Ms Grayson's house because she felt uncomfortable with him staying there.

41Secondly, Mr Timothy Hollier, a friend of the appellant and the complainant, gave evidence of admissions by the appellant including the following:

""I forced my wife to have anal sex with me. It hurt and upset her to the point that she ran out of the house screaming and crying, that I did it because I felt that I deserved it and was owed it because it was my birthday"" (Transcript pp 222 - 3).

42Thirdly, Ms Helen Stringer, a family adviser with the Family Relationship Centre, gave evidence that the appellant acknowledged in a consultation with her that he had raped the complainant (Transcript p 276). At the time of this conversation Ms Stringer made a note reflecting that acknowledgement. 

43Fourthly, Mr Ian Bartley, a couple's therapist, gave evidence of admissions by the appellant including the following:

""I hurt Carol and I've hurt Carol. I had sex with her, and she didn't consent, and I forced myself upon her and I penetrated her anally"" (Transcript p 289).

A contemporaneous note of Mr Bartley stating the following was admitted into evidence:

""Over the last two sessions 15/6/09 24/6/09 Chris has revealed to me that he has raped his estranged wife 4 times and committed [an] act of violence towards her ... "" (Exhibit 1).

44Nothing in the cross-examination of these witnesses or in the appellant's evidence denying the admissions causes me to doubt the veracity of their evidence. It was strongly supportive of the complainant's evidence. Taken as a whole, the evidence proved the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

GROUND THREE: THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF THE APPELLANT LAUGHING

45As noted earlier, the Crown led evidence from Ms Blinman that in her presence the complainant had said to the appellant, referring to sex, ""[If] I don't satisfy you and give it to you, you'll just take it"". The witness could not recall the terms of a statement that the appellant made in response but did recall that the appellant was laughing (Transcript pp 189 and 206) (see [6] above).

46In her Summing-Up, the trial judge drew the jury's attention to the issue of whether or not Ms Blinman's inability to recall what the appellant said rendered his laughter equivocal (p 29). His laughter could have represented an acknowledgement of the truth of the complainant's statement, or as the appellant asserted, it could have represented his resignation at what he claimed were his wife's constant false allegations against him. As the evidence was clearly equivocal, I can see no reasonable prospect that the jury placed any weight on it, particularly in light of the evidence from other witnesses of explicit admissions by the appellant. Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal upon the basis that, whilst it would have been preferable to instruct the jury to disregard the evidence altogether, no miscarriage of justice resulted from that not occurring.

GROUND FOUR: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE RESULTED FROM THE ABSENCE OF FRESH EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL 

47The appellant was diagnosed with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (""ADHD"") when he was 13. In 2009 he was referred by his general practitioner to a psychiatrist, Dr John Pickering, ""for review of his ADHD"". He was seen and treated by Dr Pickering on a number of occasions prior to his trial in October 2010. After the appellant's trial and for the purposes of his sentencing hearing, Dr Pickering assessed the appellant for Asperger's Disorder, resulting in a diagnosis of a mild form of that condition.

48The appellant sought to have admitted on the appeal as ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence a report of Dr Pickering dated 31 May 2011 which included the following opinions based upon his diagnosis of Asperger's Disorder:

""It [is] ... understandable, given the history of his wife repeatedly changing her mind, that Mr Norman was confused about what was acceptable to his wife and what was not. ... The writer would expect that under such circumstances, sexual communication would at best be confused and confusing, and that messages particularly if expressed ambivalently might be misunderstood. This may have been magnified greatly by Mr Norman's difficulty perceiving social cues and slowness at information processing ... He is ... someone who is not good at perceiving social cues, and as such may have misread his ex-wife's non-verbal cues and even misinterpreted what she said if it was less than a clearly-stated request for him to cease doing what he was doing during sexual encounters. In the overall context of the vacillation of his wife with respect to anal sexual encounters and the confusion that he reportedly (and indeed understandably) described, but I would certainly see it as being highly consistent with his character, his confusion, and his blunted perception of non-verbal social cues that he may have persisted with having anal intercourse with his former wife that actually went against her wishes because of his psychological/social difficulties stemming from his psychiatric disorders"" (p 5).

49Dr Pickering was cross-examined extensively, including on the assumptions he had been asked to make concerning the evidence given at the appellant's trial and also on whether he had suspected prior to the trial that the appellant had a form of Asperger's Disorder.

50The principles relating to the admission on appeal of ""fresh evidence"" (evidence not available to the accused at the time of trial, either actually or constructively) or ""new evidence"" (that which does not qualify as ""fresh evidence"") were authoritatively summarised by Kirby J (with whom Mason P and Levine J agreed) in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]. This summary included the following propositions:


""Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence"".
""Great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence by, reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial"".
""The Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice"".
The evidence must be ""credible"", or ""at least capable of belief"".
""If it is, would that evidence in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused ... or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused?"" (citations omitted).

51Assuming, without deciding, that the evidence now sought to be tendered is ""fresh"" and credible, I nevertheless do not consider that it would, if before the jury, have been likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. Nor do I consider that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if this evidence had been before it.

52The reason for these views is that Dr Pickering's evidence is founded upon the possibility that the appellant misunderstood ""non-verbal cues"" given by the complainant about her willingness to engage in the conduct the subject of the charges against the appellant or ""even misinterpreted what [the complainant] said if it was less than a clearly-stated request for [the appellant] to cease doing what he was doing"" (Report p 5). However the complainant did not give evidence that she gave non-verbal cues to the appellant, that might have been misunderstood by someone with mild Asperger's Disorder, or made statements that might have been misread by such a person. The complainant gave evidence in relation to the incidents in question that she clearly communicated her lack of consent by using words such as ""no"", ""I don't want to"" and ""stop"". As Dr Pickering accepted in cross-examination, communications such as these, if they occurred, were not capable of being misunderstood, even by a person with the appellant's condition.

53The appellant denied ever having sexual intercourse with the complainant after she said ""no"" (Transcript p 409) but relied on appeal particularly upon the following evidence given by the complainant in cross-examination:

""Q. ... at times whilst you were having sex together he would stop and he would ask you if it's okay to continue sex.
A. Yes, there were times. Yes, there were times.

Q. Those times were because you would say something or do something and he would stop. Is that correct?
A. Usually it was because I would express some concern in some way and he would stop, yes.

Q. Then he would ask permission to continue. Is that correct?
A. No.

Q. No?
A. No.

Q. All right. What I'm saying to you, ma'am, is that on those times he would ask you permission to continue.
A. On those times it was usually something that, if there was a problem I would say something, and then from there - there were some times where he'd stop completely and go out of the room, and then there were other times where he just, you know, whether by my body language he would obviously see that I'm feeling more comfortable and he'd start again. He wouldn't necessarily ask me, no"" (Transcript pp 69 - 70).

54However the questions asked in this exchange were general questions concerning the sexual relations between the complainant and the appellant. They did not relate to the specific occasions of anal sex that were the subject of the charges against the appellant. In respect of those occasions, the complainant's evidence was that she clearly indicated her lack of consent by unequivocal words such as ""no"" or ""stop"". If the jury believed this evidence, there was no room for misunderstandings or misinterpretations by the appellant of the type to which Dr Pickering referred. If the jury had not accepted that evidence, it would have returned a verdict of not guilty. The prosecution put no alternative case which relied upon communications falling short of adamant refusals of consent. 

APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE: THE SENTENCES ARE MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE

55As noted earlier, the overall sentence imposed upon the appellant was seven years and six months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four years and six months. The maximum penalty for each offence was 14 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period was prescribed at the time of the first offence but a standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment was applicable to the second and third offences. 

56In her Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge (who was also the trial judge) referred to the appellant having had a difficult childhood due to learning difficulties and social problems at school, leading to an ultimate diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (""ADHD"") that affected his schooling and his self-esteem. Her Honour referred to the appellant having remarried, with his wife remaining supportive. She further noted a pre-sentence report indicating that the appellant does not have alcohol or drug problems but has a history of psychiatric treatment dating from 1996, with a recent diagnosis of mild Asperger's Disorder. Whilst her Honour found that there had not been any ""clear expression of remorse"" by the appellant, she saw signs of ""some slowly changing attitudes on the part of [the appellant] to his culpability for these offences"" (p 10).

57On the appeal, the Crown summarised as follows the factors that led the sentencing judge to find that the appellant's offences fell ""below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind but not at the lowest end of the range"" (p 15):

""i) that the force or coercion used was not greater than that required to achieve sexual penetration

ii) no humiliating threats or insults were uttered, although the offences were committed in the context of ongoing arguments

iii) although the incidents caused pain and discomfort, they did not result in physical injury

iv) it was a degrading and serious form of sexual assault 'particularly in light of the offender's knowledge of his wife being a victim of forced anal intercourse when she was much younger'

v) the offences were opportunistic only

vi) each episode was not 'unduly lengthy in duration'

vii) the effect or impact these matters had on the victim

viii) consideration was given to the appellant's problem with ADHD and Asperger's syndrome, noting that he has, throughout his life, struggled emotionally and socially, and that, to a limited extent, this would mitigate the objective seriousness of the offences (ROS 13). Even so, 'the offender generally understood what he was doing' (ROS 14), which was evidenced by the admissions he made to [counsellors] and interveners"" (Respondent's Written Submissions [31]).

58The sentencing judge noted, by reference to authorities such as R v Grech [1999] NSWCCA 268, that the ""fact that the offender and the victim were married or had been in a prior relationship is not a mitigating factor"" (p 15), that she saw no reason why the appellant could not be rehabilitated and that he had no prior record of offences of a sexual nature. Her Honour found special circumstances on the basis that it was the appellant's first time in custody and he would require a significant period on parole in order to access the courses that would assist with his rehabilitation.

59On appeal the appellant submitted that the sentences imposed by her Honour were manifestly excessive. He did not assert that he was entitled to leniency by virtue of his marriage to the complainant but did contend that the objective seriousness of the offences had to be assessed in the context of a relationship in which the complainant consented to sexual intercourse during the marriage and, on her evidence, consented to anal intercourse on two occasions. He also submitted that the relatively short duration of the offending acts of intercourse was relevant.

60Whilst it is correct that the circumstance of marriage or a prior relationship does not of itself represent a mitigating factor, as I pointed out (with the concurrence of McCallum J and Grove AJ) in NM v R [2012] NSWCCA 215 at [53] - [60], the objective seriousness of offences such as the present need to be assessed in the context of the relationship between the offender and the complainant. No specific complaint is made by the appellant that her Honour failed to do that in the present case and I think it is implicit in her reasons that she did. Furthermore, in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour noted that the acts of intercourse were not ""unduly lengthy in duration"".

61As sentencing involves a discretionary judgment, the question for an appeal court where no specific error is shown is whether the sentence is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" or, as it is usually put, manifestly excessive (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]). As pointed out in Markarian, ""a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion"" (at [28]). 

62In my view the sentences imposed upon the appellant are not manifestly excessive as they fall within the range of sentences that were reasonably open to the sentencing judge to impose.

ORDERS

63For the reasons that I have given, the appellant's appeal against conviction and application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him should be dismissed.

64PRICE J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

65McCALLUM J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2760425,Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Johnson J in draft. I agree with his Honour's analysis of the issues raised in the appeal against conviction. I have myself reviewed the entirety of the evidence relevant to ground 2 and share Johnson J's view that the appellant failed to make out the elements of substantial impairment under s 23A Crimes Act 1900 so as to warrant a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.

2I also agree with Johnson J in relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

3JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Malcolm Robert Potts, appeals against conviction and sentence following a trial before Kirby J and a jury on a charge of murder committed on 14 September 2008.

4The trial of the Appellant commenced on 8 March 2010 and concluded with a verdict of guilty of murder on 22 March 2010. 

5On 23 July 2010, Kirby J sentenced the Appellant to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 21 years commencing on 14 September 2008 and expiring on 13 September 2029, with a balance of term of seven years expiring on 13 September 2036.

6In 2000, the Appellant killed his father. He went to trial for murder, but was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. He was sentenced by Hidden J to a head sentence of seven years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and nine months expiring on 5 February 2004: R v Potts [2001] NSWSC 753.

7The unusual circumstances of this case present (in the conviction grounds) issues concerning the operation of the partial defence of substantial impairment, together with questions (in the sentence grounds) involving considerations addressed by the High Court of Australia in Veen v The Queen [No. 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465.

The Appellant Kills a Woman in 2008

8The circumstances giving rise to the 2008 murder charge were described in the following way in Kirby J's remarks on sentence: R v Potts [2010] NSWSC 731 at [1]-[5]:

""1Emma King was a sex worker in Kings Cross. She had an arrangement when she worked outside the Kings Cross area that she could telephone a friend who would then pick her up.

2At 4.26 am on Sunday 14 September 2008, Ms King sent a text message to her friend, nominating the address of a home unit in Ashfield. The address was correct, apart from the street number of the block of units. Her friend went to Ashfield but was not able to find her. At 4.43 am he telephoned her seeking clarification. They spoke briefly and he continued his search. He phoned again at 4.54 am, but his call went to voicemail. He continued to call every few minutes over the next few hours, but his calls went unanswered.

3Ms King's partner went in search of her in the early hours of Sunday morning. The street referred to in the text message was short. She was able to identify a block of units as the likely address from which Ms King had telephoned. A man was seen in that unit, peeping through a window. She notified the police. 

4Later that morning the police sought entry. The occupant would not open the door. Ultimately the door was forced and the police entered the unit. Malcolm Potts was the owner of the unit. He stood inside the unit with a knife in each hand. He was persuaded by police to drop the knives. The unit was then searched. The police found the dead body of Emma King concealed under a bed. She was naked. She had died of stab wounds to the back. 

5Malcolm Potts was then charged with the murder of Emma King. He pleaded not guilty. He later acknowledged that he had stabbed Emma King, but said he had done so in self defence. Alternatively, it was suggested that the stabbing occurred at a time when he was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind. On 22 March 2010, after a jury trial, Malcolm Potts was convicted of the murder of Emma King.""

Grounds of Appeal

9The Appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal against conviction:

(a)Conviction Ground 1 - his Honour erred in permitting evidence to be adduced before the jury of a previous homicide committed by the Appellant.

(b)Conviction Ground 2 - the jury verdict was unreasonable.

10The Appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence upon the following grounds:

(a)Sentence Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to take into account the fact that because of his mental illness:

(i)the Appellant was an inappropriate vehicle for any general deterrence, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed; and

(ii)a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the Appellant, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.

(b)Sentence Ground 2 - the sentence was manifestly excessive.

Conviction Ground 1 - Suggested Error in Permitting Evidence to be Adduced of a Previous Homicide Committed by the Appellant

11The first ground of appeal against conviction asserts error on the part of the trial Judge in permitting evidence to be adduced before the jury of a previous homicide committed by the Appellant, being the manslaughter of his father in 2000.

12The Appellant was born in October 1967 and, at the age of 18 years, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Kirby J found on sentence, that this is a disease which is more disabling at some times than at others. However, in the 10 years prior to September 2008, the Appellant's symptoms were described by his doctor as ""fairly chronic"". He was under the care of a community health centre which he attended every two weeks, and he was given an injection of antipsychotic medication, the last such injection being given about a week before the fatal incident: R v Potts [2010] NSWSC 731 at [7].

13After the Appellant's release on parole in 2004, he was subject to ongoing psychiatric care. This care continued after his parole was breached, and again after his parole had expired.

14As mentioned earlier, the Crown alleged (and the Appellant admitted) that, on the morning of 14 September 2008, he fatally stabbed the deceased, who was a sex worker who had attended voluntarily at the Appellant's apartment. At the time of the stabbing, the victim was fully clothed. The Appellant then dragged her body into a bedroom where he placed her onto a bed and removed her clothing. The sentencing Judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had sexual intercourse with the victim after her death: R v Potts [2010] NSWSC 731 at [28].

15Doctor Sophie Kavanagh, psychiatrist, was involved in the care of the Appellant during the period after his release in 2004, and continuing up to his arrest for the subject offence on 14 September 2008. The Crown called Dr Kavanagh as a witness in the trial. 

16In addition, two forensic psychiatrists, Dr Stephen Allnutt (for the Appellant) and Dr Bruce Westmore (for the Crown) had prepared reports for the trial. Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore had involvement with the Appellant well prior to 14 September 2008. 

17Although it was not clear at the start of the trial as to whether either Dr Allnutt or Dr Westmore would be called to give evidence at the trial, Dr Allnutt was called in the defence case (after the Appellant had given evidence) and Dr Westmore was called in the Crown case in reply.

Submissions for the Appellant

18Mr Ramage QC, for the Appellant, submits that evidence of the Appellant's earlier manslaughter conviction was allowed over the objection of trial defence counsel. Although Mr Ramage QC acknowledged that the trial Judge had not given any judgment on the objection, he contended that objection was taken and maintained which, in effect, sought the exclusion of the evidence of the previous homicide upon the basis that its probative value was clearly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant: s.137 Evidence Act 1995.

19Mr Ramage QC agreed that trial defence counsel came to accept that evidence should be adduced of the fact that the Appellant had been convicted of manslaughter of his father on the basis of substantial impairment, but he contended that this constituted a fallback position at trial in the event that the primary objection to the material being tendered was overruled.

20Accordingly, Mr Ramage QC submitted that leave was not required under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules, as the point had been taken at trial. Further, he submitted that the material was so prejudicial that its admission deprived the Appellant of a fair trial. 

21Although the trial Judge had given the jury firm directions in the course of the trial and in the summing up against any tendency reasoning, Mr Ramage QC submitted that irremediable prejudice had resulted from the admission of the evidence, and that this could not be overcome by the directions given. 

22He contended, in particular, that admission of evidence of the previous homicide was prejudicial on the second leg of substantial impairment, under s.23A(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900, namely the question whether an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter, this being a value judgment to be undertaken by the jury, applying community standards. 
 
Submissions of the Crown

23The Crown submitted that a fair reading of the trial transcript indicated that no objection to the admissibility of evidence of the prior homicide was truly pressed by trial defence counsel. 

24It was submitted that discussion took place in the absence of the jury, during which the trial Judge, the Crown and defence counsel discussed these issues, but that no objection under s.137 Evidence Act 1995 was pressed which required the trial Judge to give a decision on the issue. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that Rule 4 applies so that leave to rely upon the ground is required. 

25In any event, the Crown submits that the whole history of the Appellant, and the circumstances of his treatment by psychiatrists, was relevant to issues in the trial and this serves to explain, as well, the approach taken by defence counsel at trial.

26As the evidence of the Appellant's previous homicide was tied up in the psychiatric evidence to be adduced before the jury from Drs Kavanagh, Allnutt and Westmore, the Crown submitted that it was appropriately admitted at trial. 

27Further, the Crown submitted that the trial Judge gave firm directions to the jury to guard against any possible misuse of this evidence. It was submitted that this Court should approach this ground upon the basis that the jury complied with the trial Judge's directions in accordance with the oaths and affirmations which the jurors took at the commencement of the trial.
 
The Partial Defence of Substantial Impairment

28Before moving to this ground of appeal, it is appropriate to consider the nature of the partial defence of substantial impairment at a murder trial.

29Section 23A(1) Crimes Act 1900 permits a person tried for murder to be convicted of manslaughter in the following circumstance:

""(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:

(a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.""

30""Underlying condition"" is defined in s.23A(8) as meaning ""a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind"".

31The onus lies upon the accused person to prove (on the balance of probabilities) that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of the section: s.23A(4).

32For the purpose of s.23A(1)(b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible: s.23A(2).

33It has been said that the issue under s.23A(1)(b) is a task for the tribunal of fact, which must approach that task in a broad commonsense way, involving a value judgment by the jury representing the community, and not a finding of medical fact: R v Trotter (1993) 35 NSWLR 428 at 431. It is often put to juries (as it was here) that an impairment is substantial if it is such as warrants the reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter: R v Trotter at 431; R v Ryan (1995) 90 A Crim R 191 at 195; R v Majdalawi [2000] NSWCCA 240; 113 A Crim R 241 at 243 [10]-[11]. In R v Majdalawi, Adams J observed (at 247 [36]) that the ""value judgment by the jury representing the community"" to which Hunt CJ at CL referred in R v Ryan ""is a decision about culpability"" and hence ""is not a medical question"".

34The directions of Kirby J to the jury in the present case (which were not challenged on appeal) illustrate the way in which a jury is invited to determine the s.23A(1)(b) issue. Kirby J directed the jury that the distinction between murder and manslaughter ""is both a legal distinction and a moral one"" (SU66). Manslaughter is regarded as ""having less culpability than murder and it is, therefore, punished less severely"" (SU66). If that ""incapacity did so operate and did impair him, then his moral blameworthiness would be reduced by reason of that impairment and the appropriate verdict would be manslaughter"" (SU68).

35Section 23A(1)(b) has been described as giving rise to ""an issue which is quintessentially one for the determination of a jury"": R v Hucker [2002] NSWSC 1068 at [2] (Howie J). 

36A question raised on this appeal is whether a jury considering a partial defence of substantial impairment, and thus undertaking the value judgment or moral assessment concerning the accused person's culpability required under s.23A(1)(b), is entitled to have before them, not only evidence of the accused person's history of violent conduct and of psychiatric assessment and treatment, but also evidence that he had killed a person at an earlier time in circumstances where substantial impairment was raised successfully to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.
 
How Substantial Impairment Came to be Raised at the Trial

37The resolution of this ground requires some understanding of the way in which substantial impairment arose as a trial issue.

38A notice under s.151 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 had not been filed and served on the Crown before trial indicating that a defence of substantial impairment was to be relied upon.

39Discussion took place between the trial Judge and counsel on this question before the jury was empanelled on 8 March 2010. As will be seen, the position did not culminate in a judgment being delivered by the trial Judge nor was one sought by defence counsel on the issue. 

40On 8 March 2010, before a jury was empanelled, the trial Judge observed that the matter had been mentioned a number of times and that there had been exploration of a possible defence of substantial impairment. It is clear that reports of Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore were in existence at that time, with those reports adverting to the previous homicide and its consequences (T2, 8 March 2010). 

41It is important to bear in mind that Dr Westmore had first assessed the Appellant in 2001, in the context of the earlier homicide case. Dr Allnutt had first assessed the Appellant in 2006, in the context of another criminal prosecution against him. Unusually, this was not a trial where these two very experienced forensic psychiatrists had met the Appellant after the events of 14 September 2008 which gave rise to the present charge. Accordingly, it was inevitable that the jury would hear that these forensic psychiatrists had extensive involvement with the Appellant before the killing of Ms King on 14 September 2008.

42Defence counsel raised with the trial Judge the fact that there would be references to earlier offences in the context of the psychiatric opinions (T2). He indicated that, to minimise prejudice, he was desirous to restrict the references to ""three or four offences to which some of them refer"" (T3.7 - AB575). 

43The Crown Prosecutor informed the trial Judge that it was inevitable that previous offending would be before the jury, as Dr Kavanagh relied upon the whole history of offending in reaching her opinion (T3.17). 

44In the course of this discussion, the trial Judge remarked (T3.34):

""Yes. I can understand what you say. It is the total history which is the basis for each opinion. It is not simply the recent history nor even the fact that he has been diagnosed at some point with schizophrenia and plus that recent history, it is the totality of the history which one imagines they would each regard as important as the report suggests is important to the opinion they ultimately expressed.""

45Defence counsel acknowledged that the previous history was pertinent but not the ""full facts or the full convictions"" (T3.50). He did however indicate that although some of the offending was ""highly prejudicial"", it was of benefit in showing the Appellant's state of mind (T4.5). He confirmed that he was ""never of the view that something wouldn't come in"" (T4.29).

46At the time of this discussion, it was not certain that the defence would seek to rely upon substantial impairment. At that time, the medical evidence did not support a partial defence of substantial impairment (T5.2). The issue was not then resolved, it being observed that the past history material would probably not be relevant unless substantial impairment was raised (T6.11).

47Before substantial impairment was confirmed as a trial issue, defence counsel adduced evidence in cross-examination of Sergeant Whyte (T201) and Detective Sergeant McCarthy (T231) revealing the Appellant's prior involvement with the police. 

48On 11 March 2010, the fourth day of the trial, discussion took place in the absence of the jury concerning evidence to be adduced from Dr Kavanagh. The Crown indicated that Dr Kavanagh was to be called in response to defence questioning that had elicited evidence of the Appellant's mental difficulties, including schizophrenia (T235.32). 

49It was at this stage of the trial that the issue raised by the first conviction ground was further ventilated (T235-241). 

50The Crown submission at trial was, in effect, that the substance of the Appellant's offending was intrinsic to the psychiatrist's opinion and, for the jury to be able to assess the psychiatrist's evidence, it would be necessary for them to comprehend the basis of the expressed opinion. Defence counsel did not challenge this broad proposition.

51Defence counsel conceded that the jury should be aware that Dr Kavanagh was the Appellant's treating psychiatrist, that the Appellant had a history of violence associated with his schizophrenia, and that he had been on parole (T236.34-36). It was submitted, however, that the jury did not need to be informed that the ""history of violence"" included manslaughter. This submission was made on the basis that it would ""distract from everything else"" and that the ""prejudice is just too great"" (T236.46-49).

52Defence counsel made the following submission, which Mr Ramage QC (who did not appear at trial) submitted in this Court constituted an effective objection under s.137 Evidence Act 1995 (T237.17):

""The Crown can still get the same material it needs as I can without going down that path. That is my main objection, your Honour, because the prejudice, in my respectful submission, is just far too great to circumvent and immediately would distract from the main issues here.

Unless there is something else, that is my main objection that ordinarily it is not relevant. It has certainly a tendency flavour about it, not that the Crown is leading it on that, naturally.""

53His Honour observed immediately (T237.26-238.17):

""HIS HONOUR: I will give a tendency warning. I would say that they must not reason because he has another previous offence of manslaughter therefore he has a tendency to commit that sort of crime.

I will think about exactly what I do say but in some respects I think to leave it up in the air as to what the violence was and who the objects were and what happened and so on in many ways is worse. In many ways it leads to speculation, the nature of the crime, the gravity of the crime and so on. In some ways, especially if one looks at Justice Hidden's judgment, I mean the fact that killing your father is perhaps more comprehensible than killing a perfect stranger in the sense that most murders do involve family members and arise out of family turmoil in relationships which this is not part. It just seems to me there is an air of unreality to the exclusion of this material.

This is the material upon which not only Dr Kavanagh but, ultimately, Dr Westmore, Dr Allnutt, have each based their opinions upon extensive psychiatric notes which derive from the prison records, the medical records. Now you may challenge them about some aspect, which at this moment I can't foresee, and suddenly they need to justify their opinion by reference to material they have read. It becomes very difficult and very awkward.""

54Defence counsel responded to the trial Judge in the following way (T238.19-239.33) (emphasis added):

""BONNICI: I agree with your Honour, it is. I am not suggesting it is an easy task. I am having difficulty with it too to balance both sides. However, I think the warning about causing them not to speculate which your Honour will give in any event is probably a lot better than saying well the fact he has killed his father and there was a manslaughter charge and I suppose there is a charge of murder and how they can go into detail after that I don't know, is probably, in my respectful submission, far more prejudicial than the risk of speculation because the nature of the actual offence itself and the particulars of that offence do not change the character of Mr Potts.

HIS HONOUR: In some ways it is in your favour because the inference they may draw from it is the correct inference, that is, that he was ultimately convicted of manslaughter or pleaded guilty to manslaughter, I am not sure which.

BONNICI: He was found guilty of manslaughter because of substantial impaired judgment.

HIS HONOUR: Yes because of substantial impairment. Now in this case we ultimately have three possible paths by which the jury may reach manslaughter. One is through not being satisfied as to intention in which case they consider dangerous and unlawful act. It would be very surprising if they did not take the view this was a dangerous and unlawful act. The second which is through the path of self-defence and if they get to that issue then they have to consider or they may have to consider excessive self- defence. Again, given the disparity between the different individuals and the nature of the injuries, that is one possible version.

The third one is the one for which you are contending but they are all available and they are all possibilities and that is substantial impairment. Now the fact that he has previously committed an offence and been convicted and that offence was manslaughter does rather suggest, as is the fact, that some jury has found or someone has found that his judgment was substantially impaired by reason of mental illness.

Now I would have thought that that is something more likely in your favour. I mean it is not like the usual case where there is a real chance of acquittal. Of course there is a chance always but in the real world I think in terms of considering the prejudice on these facts you would acknowledge, I imagine, that the most likely outcome overwhelmingly is manslaughter.

BONNICI: In fact may I say this, as I understood the Crown submission the Crown was only going to make reference to the offence but if included in that would be the fact that the original charge of substantial impairment was found and then it was manslaughter I certainly probably would warm to that because that balances it out.

HIS HONOUR: That is not a bad suggestion.

BONNICI: I thought the Crown was just going to leave it but [if] all that comes in and I must say that opens the door and I put it on record now, when I first read this brief and I think I pointed out once already there are a lot of reports around 2004 from Probation and Parole officers suggesting he should not be released because he was still a risk to the community. If the Crown goes down that path I certainly would continue. That is what I am saying.

HIS HONOUR: I don't understand the Crown to be opening up that or relying on that. That seems to me somewhat remote, too remote from 2008. But I think your suggestion, combined with the plan which the Crown has outlined, which is really fundamental in paragraph 4 of Dr Kavanagh's report, together with the fact that the jury, that it was a jury verdict based upon or it was a verdict based upon substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind. Are you happy with that Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour.""

55Further discussion ensued between the trial Judge and counsel, concerning the history of the Appellant to be elicited in evidence. The sitting day concluded in the following way (T241.7) (emphasis added):

""HIS HONOUR: All right, we have got two issues. The first issue is how we deal with the conviction in terms of 2001 and it seems to me the appropriate course in respect of that is the compromise which has been suggested, namely, that you mentioned manslaughter but the Crown include the verdict was a jury verdict if you like a jury verdict on the basis of substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind. That is the first thing.

The second issue relates to the history in between, that is between his release from gaol which was in about 2007 and when he was returned. I think he was return in --

CROWN PROSECUTOR: He was released from parole I think in about 2004 then sent back and not released until about the middle of 2007. That is when Dr Kavanagh takes over his care.

HIS HONOUR: That history also I think is important and in terms of the various opinions that have been expressed during that period then the summary by Dr Allnutt or by Dr Westmore is surely enough. Frankly I think it would be over burdening the jury to go beyond that if you had in mind tendering a lot of other reports or calling other witnesses. Frankly I would have thought that would not really help anyone but you run your own race as far as that is concerned Mr Bonnici.

BONNICI: Thank you your Honour. I do not intend to tender the reports your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: By all means you explore such issues including insanity as you wish.

BONNICI: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.""

56Mr Ramage QC submitted that his Honour's statements in the preceding paragraph constituted the Court's ruling on the objection by defence counsel.

57On the next day of the trial, Dr Kavanagh gave evidence. The Appellant's manslaughter conviction on the ground of substantial impairment, and his release and breach of parole, were mentioned (T267-268). Under cross-examination, Dr Kavanagh agreed that her report was written ""on the basis of the whole history"" (T277.37). 

58Defence counsel asked Dr Kavanagh about the Appellant's history and why she had ""great fears about him"" (T278.28-39):

""Q. Even without those reasons you had great fears about him already?
         A. Absolutely, we all did.
Q. That's why I'm asking why he would have those great fears?
A. Yep. We knew that Mr Potts had a very long history of mental illness. We also knew that he had a very long history of offences against other people. And so we knew that for both of those reasons he was a very high risk. In the past Mr Potts had committed offences, which did seem to be related to his mental illness, but he had also committed offences which did not seem to be related to his mental illness. All we could do from the Mental Health Service was try to reduce the risk that we could and that meant trying to get the best control of his mental illness that we could.""

59Soon after, defence counsel asked Dr Kavanagh (T280.1-13):

""Q. Apart from that episode, because of what you said about medication, certainly if you go back to the charge that was referred to by the Crown about the manslaughter it appears there that there was a finding of substantial impairment? 
A. Yes.

Q. From a medical point of view and not from a legal point of view what does that mean? 
A. My understanding of it from a medical point of view - and I don't know the legal definition - is that Mr Potts was so affected by his mental illness that he was out of touch with reality and therefore could not be held responsible for his actions.""

60A little later, in cross-examination, Dr Kavanagh was asked (T289.7-25):

""Q. In fact some of the - brought out by you and the other psychologists at the mental health unit at Croydon, had he indicated there were risk of further offences and violence; was there? 
A. Absolutely. There have been many offences in the past, yes.



Q. That is directly due to his mental illness, is it not? 
A. I couldn't say that all of them were directly due to the mental illness because I only read this in the file. From my understanding of the file, some occasions Mr Potts had committed offences that were not thought to be related to his mental illness, and that's quite relevant to the neighbour because there had been altercation where the neighbour in the past, around Mr Potts repainting the building and playing music too loud. And on one occasion he threatened the neighbour and she was quite justifiably scared of him and he was actually absent without leave from hospital at the time. The police were called he was taken back to the hospital and discharged the next day because they felt he was mentally well. That has to be taken in the context of a man who is never deemed well. It is very difficult to say what he does, that is due to his mental illness, what is due to his underlying personality, what might be due to - because Mr Potts is always pretty much chronically mentally ill.""

61Defence counsel concluded his cross-examination of Dr Kavanagh in the following way (T299.32-41):

""Q. From your opinion, your last opinion, that he suffers from a psychotic illness, namely schizophrenia, that's based on his whole history and also what you have observed from him, is that correct? A. Yes.

Q. But also very much so is what you have read, from what all the other clinical notes have said and also from the behaviour that you have monitored, that's right too, isn't it?
A. Yes, even if I hadn't the read [the] reports he still obviously had schizophrenia.""

62At the conclusion of the evidence of Dr Kavanagh, the trial Judge gave the jury an extensive direction concerning the permissible use of this evidence and a warning against tendency reasoning. His Honour said to the jury (T300-304):

""HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, we have reached one o'clock, but it's been an unusual morning in terms of evidence. I think it is important that before you depart I give you some preliminary directions about the way in which you should approach this evidence.

You have heard in the course of Dr Kavanagh's evidence that Mr Potts, in the year 2001, was convicted of manslaughter, the victim being his father and convicted on the basis, that is manslaughter on the basis that he was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind. You can, as I will ultimately explain to you, be convicted of manslaughter upon a number of different bases; indeed some different bases will arise in this trial. But one species of manslaughter is manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind. That was the basis upon which Mr Potts was convicted apparently in 2001 in respect to the death of his father.

You also heard that he was then sentenced to a term of imprisonment, granted parole and ultimately I think rearrested for breach of that parole and there was other material which related to condoms and a child and various other matters. He ultimately was required to serve the balance of his sentence and was eventually released on 5 May 2007.

Obviously, you have now been apprised of significant material, which has attached to it significant prejudice. In the ordinary course, in the ordinary trial, a jury is not usually told anything about the past of an accused person. That precisely is because it is likely to be a distraction and likely to be highly prejudicial to their consideration of the particular issues that arise.

In this case, unusually, there is a level of complexity that makes it necessary for you to be told about this. But nonetheless there will be issues that you will have to deal with, including the issue of self-defence in which these matters are completely irrelevant.

You are going to be in a position where it is going to be necessary for you to put these matters out of your mind when you, for instance, apply your mind to the issue of the circumstances in which this young woman met her death and whether or not the Crown has excluded beyond reasonable doubt that it arose in circumstances of self-defence.

You will ultimately be told by me, when I give you the directions in my summing-up, that self-defence if the Crown does not manage to eliminate self-defence then that can operate, subject to one qualification, as a complete answer to the charge. In other words, the appropriate verdict would be not guilty because the Crown would then have failed to prove its case.

There is a qualification to that. I do not know want to confuse you or take unnecessary time now, but we will go into it in due course. There is what is known as excessive self-defence. If it is the case of self-defence, but the person has gone over the top and they have defended themselves too strongly and it is a case of excessive self-defence then the appropriate verdict in that circumstance would not be a complete acquittal, it will be a case of manslaughter. That could be another species of manslaughter.

What I should do before we depart is tell you the way in which you may legitimately use the information you have been given concerning the past of this man and the way in which you must not use it. I think it is important that do it now before we have a weekend.

The only relevance of this material is to the present psychiatric state - or when I say the present the psychiatric state of Malcolm Potts on the evening of 14 September 2008. That is the only relevance of that material.

That is whether at that point he suffered from - and this is one of the species of manslaughter as I say where the appropriate verdict of manslaughter would be open to you if you were persuaded this was the case - that he suffered from an abnormality of mind and that abnormality was present, relevant and operating and it was appropriate to convict him of manslaughter rather than murder or rather acquit him. I am not giving you instructions as to how you should find, I am simply trying to give you instructions as to the way in which this ultimately may be relevant. Ultimately your verdict is entirely a matter for you. That's the only way in which you can ultimately use this material. That is something which is relevant to his psychiatric health on this evening.

Let me tell you now the way in which you cannot use it and must not use it. That is you cannot use it for what is called tendency reasoning. That is to reason that by reason of the fact that he killed someone in the past, therefore he had a tendency to be violent or that he had a tendency to kill people. You cannot use it for that purpose and the Crown does not put it forward on that basis. It would be quite unfair to use it on that basis and indeed a breach of your oath. You must only use it as an appreciation of his psychiatric health on the night.

As a means of understanding that mental condition you are told his complete history because it would be completely artificial to exclude this from your view and your knowledge. You are told that he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic at the age of 18. This happened along the way and other things happened along the way.

Ultimately you will have called before you two eminent forensic psychiatrists, apart from Dr Kavanagh who obviously is highly qualified in the same field, who will be in a position to first of all know this man's psychiatric history because they are familiar with the documents, but also in a position to comment upon the precise circumstances of that evening and whether or not there was an abnormality of mind or some other psychiatric condition.

That broadly is the position. I thought it was important to say that before you depart for the weekend. Before you do so, let me first of all go to counsel and invite their comment.

Mr Crown, first of all, do you have any difficulty with anything I have said?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, I don't, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Bonnici?

BONNICI: Just one aspect, your Honour, the in self-defence the mental element and the characteristics of the actual individual, particularly in this case, are they totally separate or don't they come into play on the basis of how he perceived it? Your Honour said --

HIS HONOUR: We will debate that in due course.

In my view, the material relating to conviction of this man for manslaughter is utterly irrelevant to self-defence as are the other matters. As to the relevance of the fact that he was a diagnosed schizophrenic, we will debate that in due course.

Is there anything else?

BONNICI: No, that was all, your Honour, just that aspect.

HIS HONOUR: I might say this, just put your minds at rest members of the jury, in due course you will be given, by me, written directions which will identify very precisely in paragraphs the particular elements of the crime of murder. What you have to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt before you can return a verdict of guilty of murder or otherwise be obliged to acquit.

Similarly, you will be given written directions as part of the same body of written directions and I will discuss these with counsel before they are distributed to ensure that they conform with their view of the law as well as my own.

HIS HONOUR: Although, ultimately, I am the trial Judge so I have the responsibility, but you will be given the directions which will identify what I anticipate will be three species of manslaughter, one of which I have already identified; that is what is called excessive self-defence. Another one is called unlawful and dangerous act. I won't trouble you with the circumstance with which each of these apply but they will be identified and you will know exactly. The third is what we have been discussing, the reason for introducing this material today, and that is manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment arising from abnormality of mind, that is the third species of manslaughter which may ultimately be relevant to your deliberations.

So you will have a fairly complex task but it will, I hope, be made easier by the precise written directions and by addresses, ultimately, from counsel and summing-up from me.""

63His Honour repeated this warning in an emphatic form in the summing up (SU4-7):

""I should in this context repeat a warning I gave you in the course of this trial. This trial has been unusual in that you have heard aspects of the accused's criminal history, indeed, a deal about the accused. You have heard that in 2000 or thereabouts he was convicted of the manslaughter of his father With whom he had an argument, upon the basis of the jury having determined it was manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment arising from an abnormality of mind. You have also heard that he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment as a result of having been convicted of that offence. More than that, you have heard that, having been released from gaol in 2004 he then breached his parole and the circumstances were described, and I will not repeat them, but he breached his parole and was returned to gaol, he, thereafter, served the balance of his term, being released on 5 May 2007.

You have heard a deal of material which carries with it obvious and significant prejudice. I might say in the usual trial care is taken, indeed one goes to pains to ensure that the jury never knows anything about the background of the accused, and that because this material is so prejudicial. That it is thought to jeopardise the fact finding task which the jury must perform. This trial is unusual in that there is a long history of mental illness. It really would be quite artificial to give you part of that history and not the whole history, to tell you something about his mental illness but not tell you the entire story, lest you be prejudiced against him. You need to have the whole story, just as the psychiatrists who give their opinions about his psychiatric condition have the whole story, in order to understand the depth and breadth of the psychiatric condition from which he has suffered.

This material is, therefore, placed before you but let me repeat the directions I previously gave as to the way in which you may use that material legitimately and the way in which you must not use that material.

The evidence has relevance as part of the history of mental illness and that history may have relevance to his psychiatric state on the morning of these events, the morning of 14 September 2008 and whether or not at that time he was suffering from an abnormality mind which substantially impaired him in his capacity to understand events or differentiate between right and wrong or to control himself. So that is the relevance of that material and that is
the way in which it can legitimately be used. 

Let me remind you of the ways in which information may not be used. You must not use this material for what is called tendency reasoning; that is, that he had a tendency to be violent or to act violently, or that he had a tendency to kill people and, therefore, probably murdered Emma King. You must not use it in that way; The Crown does not put that material in that way; it does not suggest any such tendency, so it would be quite illogical and unfair for you to use any aspect of his past other than as an aspect of his psychiatric history.

I repeat: The material has been introduced by the Crown only in order to give you his psychiatric history so that you can understand the depth and breadth of it. It has been going on since the age of 18 when he was first diagnosed and he has been in and out, as I will remind you later, of psychiatric institutions. He has been diagnosed consistently with paranoid schizophrenia.

Having said that, you have also heard it is a condition which, to some degree, waxes and wanes, although I think the evidence was that in the last 10 years or so it has become more chronic, but I will go to the medical evidence later and remind you of it. 
When you come to consider the issue of self-defence and whether the Crown has excluded that he was acting in self-defence, the previous conviction for manslaughter has no relevance except as an aspect of his psychiatric history; that is the only way in which you should use it. So that really does just repeat the warning which I gave you at the time this evidence was first introduced. Let me leave that and return to your particular role as the jury in this trial."" 

Has Error Been Established Under the First Conviction Ground of Appeal?

64An appropriate starting point is to assess what course defence counsel took at trial on this issue. It is for defence counsel to take the objection at trial, and to maintain it with the trial Judge then ruling on the objection, if the objection is pressed. No ruling was given in this case and defence counsel did not request the trial Judge to give reasons for any suggested ruling allowing the evidence to be given. Counsel did not refer to s.137 Evidence Act 1995, nor were submissions advanced by reference to any authority in that respect.

65The Evidence Act 1995 applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection: Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 at 9 [20]. 

66Section 137 Evidence Act 1995 does not impose an obligation on a trial Judge to reject evidence to which no objection has been taken at trial by defence counsel: R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 at 652-653 [28]-[30]; Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245 at [30]. 

67If arguments had been pressed of the type advanced in this Court, his Honour would have been called upon to make a decision as to whether the probative value of evidence of the Appellant's prior homicide was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In Abbosh v R; Bene v R [2011] NSWCCA 265, with the concurrence of Bathurst CJ and James J, I said at [68]-[70]:

""68This Court has observed that s.137 applies where there is a real risk, and not a hypothetical one, of unfairness arising to the accused from the admission of evidence: R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364 at [60]. The key term in s.137 is 'unfair prejudice', in the sense of evidence creating 'a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way': Papakosmas v The Queen at 324-326 [90]-[94]; R v GK [2001] NSWCCA 413; 53 NSWLR 317 at 324 [30].

69This Court should be cautious in approaching grounds of appeal challenging the refusal of trial Judges to exclude evidence under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. It is always necessary to keep in mind the advantage of the trial Judge making such a ruling in the contemporaneous atmosphere of the trial. 

70Further, this Court (as a court of error) should bear in mind the limited circumstances in which it may overturn a trial Judge's ruling such as a ruling under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way or if the judge misdirected himself: R v O'Donoghue (1998) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401. The submission here is that there was, in reality, only one correct answer to the objection, namely the rejection of the evidence under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. I accept that submission. The decision fell within the final category of error in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.""

68I accept the Crown submission that a fair reading of the relevant extracts from the transcript indicates that, although there was a preliminary objection made by trial defence counsel, counsel formed the view (in the course of discussion) that there was an advantage in the jury being informed of the prior finding of substantial impairment, so that the objection was not pressed. Had the objection been maintained, it is difficult to understand why trial counsel would not have requested his Honour to give reasons for a decision reached after a fully contested objection. The fact that this did not happen supports the Crown submission that this was a fluid and ongoing discussion, following an initial objection, but with the objection not being pressed because of counsel's assessment of the place of the issue in the trial. 

69In my view, Rule 4 stands in the way of the Appellant. It is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has resulted in order to justify this Court granting leave under Rule 4 to permit this ground of appeal to be advanced: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at 352-353 [20]-[24].

70Even if it is accepted, however, that objection was taken under s.137 and that his Honour's comments at [55] above may be taken as a ruling overruling the objection and allowing the evidence, it would be necessary for this Court to approach the ground of appeal in accordance with the principles stated in the extract from Abbosh v R; Bene v R at [67] above.

71It is apparent from the discussions that took place (as set out earlier) that his Honour appreciated the unusual features of this trial. Given the issues in the trial, there was no real chance of an outright acquittal. The fact that the Appellant's mental condition was long standing, and had been accepted previously as amounting to substantial impairment was approached by defence counsel as being not unhelpful to the defence in circumstances where his extensive psychiatric history and history of acts of violence was to be before the jury.

72To the extent that this ground of appeal attracts attention to decisions made by defence counsel during the trial, it is appropriate to refer to relevant principles. Decisions by trial counsel concerning evidence might later be regretted, but the wisdom of such decisions can rarely be the proper concern of appeal courts: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at 128 [8] (Gleeson CJ). For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered or wise: TKWJ v The Queen at 130 [16] (Gleeson CJ). In the same case, Gleeson CJ said at 131 [16]:

""Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks.""

73In the same case, Hayne J (Gummow J agreeing at 157 [101]) said at 158 [106] (footnotes omitted):

""Account must be taken of the nature of a criminal trial. A criminal trial is not an examination of all the material that exists and bears on the question of an accused's guilt. It is an accusatory and adversarial process in which the prosecution and the defence are responsible for deciding the ground on which the trial will be fought and the evidence that each will lead. That is why the rules about fresh evidence on appeal have developed as they have. And the decisions that are made by the parties about how the trial is to be fought are decisions made on material that may in some respects be incomplete and in other respects turn on questions of professional judgment about which reasonable minds may differ.""

74In Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 214 ALR 1 at 5 [12], Gleeson CJ said:

""It is not to the point for the appellant to show that in certain respects the trial might have been conducted differently, or that in certain respects it might have been conducted more skilfully. Nor is it sufficient to show that some inadmissible evidence was received.""

75In the same case, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at 22 [99] (footnotes omitted):

""It will frequently be difficult to make a confident judgment, after the event, of the actions taken and decisions made by counsel in the conduct of a long criminal trial before a jury. It is also difficult to make an assessment of the likely impact of them upon the deliberations of the jury. What may now appear obvious with the advantage of hindsight, may at the time have presented an entirely different, and on occasions, insoluble dilemma. Sometimes it may, not imprudently, seem to an advocate, better to abstain from objecting to only marginally or relatively innocuous, or barely credible evidence, even if technically it is inadmissible. Such a stance might be taken for tactical reasons: for example, not to be seen to be objecting to what is obvious, or will be proved by another witness or witnesses anyway, or which, if objected to, might suggest that the accused has something to hide, or might give the impression that counsel and whom he represents are being obstructive. These are tactical decisions, to be made, sometimes intuitively and on the basis of the client's instructions, often upon an impression of a witness necessarily formed hurriedly, and having regard to the fluidity of any trial in which the outcome depends upon viva voce evidence.""

76I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in the trial Judge's approach to this evidence at trial. This was an unusual trial and the approach of defence counsel did not involve sustained opposition to the admission of this evidence. Rather, as I have said, the approach of defence counsel involved an acceptance that the better course was to not press the objection.

77In any event, I observe that it is reasonable to contend that evidence of the Appellant's prior homicide was relevant to the jury's broad function under s.23A(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900.

78I have mentioned earlier (at [33]-[34]) the value judgment or moral assessment which the jury is to undertake for the purposes of s.23A(1)(b). Opinion evidence is prohibited on this issue. It is for the jury alone to make this assessment of culpability, applying community standards.

79In this case, it was accepted that the whole history of the Appellant had been taken into account by three psychiatrists, all of whom had assessed or treated the Appellant for a period commencing long before September 2008. It was accepted that the Appellant's history of violence and his associated psychiatric history, would be before the jury. The fact that the Appellant had acted violently towards persons was relevant. There was a great deal to be said for the view that it was preferable for the jury to know the true circumstances of these violent episodes, rather than be left to speculate as to what they may have been. This was the view ultimately adopted by trial defence counsel. 

80The ""compromise"" reached which saw a limited reference to this matter, associated with a statement that the Appellant had been convicted of manslaughter on the ground of substantial impairment, was seen to be capable of operating favourably to the Appellant. The fact that the Appellant had a prior homicide (with an associated finding of substantial impairment) was not a circumstance extraneous to the jury's broad assessment for the purposes of s.23A(1)(b) of the Act.

81Any adverse impact flowing from the identification of the fact that the Appellant had committed, in the words of the ground of appeal, ""a previous homicide"" was ameliorated by the fact that the jury had detailed evidence of the Appellant's psychiatric and personal history, and knowledge that a finding of substantial impairment had been made with respect to him. 

82The fact that it may now be contended, with the benefit of hindsight, that it would have been preferable not to have the Appellant's previous homicide placed before the jury, does not mean that this ground of appeal should be upheld. There were competing views available at the time of the trial, and trial defence counsel settled on an approach which involved a ""compromise"" (see [55] above). 

83In any event, the trial Judge gave the jury detailed directions during the course of the trial, and again during the summing up, concerning the proper use of this evidence, and directing the jury not to use tendency reasoning with respect to it. In Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414, McHugh J at 425-426 [31]-[32] said (footnotes omitted):

""[31] The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials. It is of course true that, if a jury persists in returning a verdict that is contrary to law, the trial judge must accept it. But that only means in Lord Mansfield's words that, although '[i]t is the duty of the Judge ... to tell the jury how to do right ... they have it in their power to do wrong'.

[32] In my respectful opinion, the fundamental assumption of the criminal jury trial requires us to proceed on the basis that the jury acted in this case on the evidence and in accordance with the trial judge's directions and that they would have done so even if manslaughter had been left as an issue, as it should have been left. In Spratt, Pidgeon J said, correctly in my opinion, 'that an appellate court must proceed on the basis that the jury have understood and applied the law in reaching a true verdict'.""

84This Court should proceed upon the basis that the jury in this case followed the careful directions given twice by the trial Judge concerning use of evidence of the Appellant's prior homicide. 

85I am not satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case. I would refuse the Appellant leave under Rule 4 to rely upon the first ground of appeal. Even if Rule 4 had no application to this ground, I would, in any event, reject the ground of appeal.

86I should note a further submission of the Crown concerning this ground. If error was established in accordance with Conviction Ground 1, the Crown submitted that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice so that the Court should apply the proviso under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. If this point had been reached on the appeal, I would have applied the proviso. If evidence of the Appellant's previous homicide was disregarded, I would nevertheless be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence properly admitted at the trial, that the Appellant was guilty of murder: RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209 at 227-229 [129]-[143]. More particularly, I would be satisfied that the admission of evidence of the previous homicide did not impact on a correct verdict. The examination of evidence adduced at the trial, undertaken for the purposes of Conviction Ground 2, will serve to explain my conclusion concerning the proviso as well.

Conviction Ground 2 - The Jury Verdict was Unreasonable

Submissions

87Mr Ramage QC submits that the verdict of guilty of murder was unreasonable in this case. He submitted that there was clear evidence that the Appellant had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for many years and that, in the weeks leading up to 14 September 2008, the evidence from various neighbours was that the Appellant looked particularly unwell and was behaving in strange ways. He pointed to the fact that the expert evidence was that the Appellant had in his blood stream less than the therapeutic dose of the antipsychotic medication which he was meant to be taking in September 2008. 

88Mr Ramage QC sought to rely, as well, upon the comment of the trial Judge made during the course of the trial, and in the absence of the jury, ""I imagine, that the most likely outcome overwhelmingly is manslaughter"" (T239.7 set out at [54] above). 

89The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to reject the partial defence of substantial impairment in the circumstances of this case. Reference was made to the evidence of the three psychiatrists who had given evidence before the jury in this respect. Further, the Crown submitted that the Appellant derived no assistance on this ground from the trial Judge's comment made (in the absence of the jury) before evidence had been given by the Appellant, Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore.
 
Decision

90In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. 

91The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of murder: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at 405-406 [11]-[14], 408-409 [20]-[22]. 

92In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [29].

93In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.""

94There is an unusual feature to this ground in the present appeal.

95The Appellant contends, in effect, that this Court should quash the conviction for murder upon the basis that a verdict of guilty of manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment ought be substituted. Although the written submissions for the Appellant contended that a retrial should be ordered, it is difficult to see how such a result would arise if Conviction Ground 2 was upheld. The focus of the submissions for the Appellant on this ground was that the Appellant ought be acquitted of murder upon the substantial impairment issue, a necessary consequence of which would be conviction for manslaughter. 

96The Crown submitted, correctly, that if the second conviction ground was made good, the appropriate order would be a substituted verdict of manslaughter under s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

97In considering this ground of appeal, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Appellant bore the onus of proof at trial, on the balance of probabilities, to establish the partial defence of substantial impairment. This is not a case where this Court is exercising its appellate function upon issues where the Crown bore the onus of proof, beyond reasonable doubt, on all issues. There is no reason in principle why an unreasonable verdict ground cannot apply to a case where the Appellant bore the onus of proof at trial, on the balance of probabilities, to establish the partial defence of substantial impairment: R v Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364 at 373-374.

98Here, there was no dispute that it was the Appellant who had killed the deceased. The presently relevant question at trial was whether the Appellant had established, on the civil standard, that a finding of substantial impairment should be made leading to a conviction for manslaughter. 

99Importantly, the Appellant gave evidence at trial and the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing him give evidence, a factor which is relevant to determination of this ground of appeal. There was a challenge to the Appellant's credibility, including a challenge to his crucial evidence of hearing ""voices"" before the killing, an account not given by the Appellant until his evidence before the jury. 

100All three psychiatrists had professional dealings with the Appellant prior to the tragic events of 14 September 2008. Dr Kavanagh first treated the Appellant in 2007, Dr Allnutt had assessed him in 2006 and Dr Westmore had assessed him in 2001. Additionally, consultation notes of another psychiatrist, Dr David Greenberg, made on 15 September 2008 were tendered in evidence (Exhibit 2). 

101Prior to the commencement of the trial, there was no expert evidence supportive of a partial defence of substantial impairment. Although Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore had examined the Appellant, neither expressed an opinion supportive of substantial impairment.

102Dr Kavanagh had given evidence in the Crown case. Although Dr Kavanagh referred to the Appellant's long-term mental health issues, she said (T278.34):

""In the past Mr Potts has committed offences, which did seem to be related to his mental illness, but he had also committed offences which did not seem to be related to his mental illness.""

103Dr Kavanagh was asked questions concerning the notes taken by Dr Greenberg on 15 September 2008. She remarked that Dr Greenberg's observations could be due to the Appellant being unwell, or they could be due to him being angry with the situation, his personality or being remorseful in understanding the seriousness of the situation (T284-287, T300). Under cross-examination, Dr Kavanagh raised the question whether the Appellant's antisocial personality traits were separate from his mental illness (T295.46-296.1):

""Q. Tendency, what about in relation to tendency to impulsive behaviour, easily angered when he is frustrated?
A. Yes. But that is not necessarily linked to the mental illness. So there is also the question of, the question raised in the past as to whether or not Mr Potts has antisocial personality traits, and that is apart from the question of his mental illness.""

104A critical piece of evidence on the substantial impairment issue was the Appellant's evidence that he heard voices shortly prior to the killing. Until this evidence had been given, Dr Allnutt's opinion did not support substantial impairment. Although the evidence of the forensic psychiatrists agreed that the Appellant suffered from a psychiatric illness at the time of the killing (paranoid schizophrenia), until the Appellant asserted that he heard voices, neither psychiatrist linked the mental disorder to the killing. On the assumption that the Appellant did hear voices at the relevant time, Dr Allnutt opined that the relevant link existed. Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that, even if the Appellant did hear voices at the time, an examination of the Appellant's complete account of events in the apartment did not support a causal link between the illness and the killing.

105Accordingly, there was a significant factual issue at the threshold of the substantial impairment question, as to which the Appellant bore the onus of proof on the civil standard.

106It was necessary for the jury to be satisfied of the matters in s.23A(1)(a) before the value judgment or moral assessment was required to be undertaken by the jury for the purposes of s.23A(1)(b) of the Act.

107The Appellant gave evidence at trial indicating that, on 14 September 2008, he had heard a voice whilst in the kitchen of the Ashfield unit tell him to ""be careful of her [the deceased]"" (T371.46). In cross-examination, the Appellant said that the words were ""be careful of her and her friends"", although he then retracted that version (T386.12). He also gave evidence that, earlier on the night before meeting the deceased, he had heard his name in police or ambulance sirens (T376.5). 

108Other than reporting those words for the first time in evidence, the Appellant maintained that he had acted (in self defence) in response to the deceased producing a knife, and out of fear for his safety. He said that he had not previously told doctors of the voice to avoid being classified as a forensic patient (T376.15). 

109It was this evidence of auditory hallucinations, advanced for the first time by the Appellant in the witness box, which led to expert opinion supportive of substantial impairment.

110Dr Allnutt then gave evidence in the defence case that, if it were accepted that the Appellant had auditory hallucinations, that would be supportive of a relevant abnormality of mind for the purposes of the partial defence of substantial impairment. It was Dr Allnutt's opinion that the auditory hallucinations (if they occurred) constituted the nexus between the Appellant's psychosis and the victim (T437-438, 451-452).

111Dr Westmore had first spoken to the Appellant in February 2001 in relation to the killing of the Appellant's father. He examined the Appellant in 2010 in advance of the trial, and had also undertaken a document review.

112Dr Westmore considered that the Appellant had a mental illness at the time of the killing in September 2008, with the history suggesting a treatment-resistant condition. The blood level of antipsychotic drugs in the Appellant's system indicated to Dr Westmore that it was either untreated or treatment resistant (T477). When Dr Westmore examined the Appellant, he provided a non-psychotic explanation in relation to the events which led to the homicide. Dr Westmore was aware of the Appellant's account that he had heard voices, but this did not change his opinion. He had also had an opportunity to read Dr Allnutt's evidence, and there was nothing in his evidence that changed his opinion.

113During the course of cross-examination, Dr Westmore was asked by the trial Judge (T482.43-483.20):

""Q. If you assume that he in fact heard the voice saying the words that he gave, and that he had a conversation with the deceased in which she told him the various things which you read in the transcript yesterday, about people coming to assist her and take his property and recompense for the trouble she had been put to, what comment, if any, do you have on that? 
A. If the history, your Honour, was that he developed beliefs about the deceased rather than his actual history, then my view about, my conclusive view would be different. But he doesn't say he believed that. He doesn't say that he felt she was going to attack him. He says that she picked up a knife, threatened him and he felt threatened and he responded to that. Now, if I accept his history, that is not delusional; that is what occurred. So that occurred in the absence of his mental illness and not in the absence of it, but was not influenced by his mental illness. He said she responded in a certain way and he behaved in a certain way because of that; that is not linked to his mental illness; that is him reacting to an event which occurred in his home.

BONNICI: Q. That is accepting of course it even happened that way? 
A. Correct.

Q. Apart from him saying so, and bearing in mind his medication, bearing in mind his voice and all those other factors, how could you possibly make that assessment only on what he says, bearing in mind, too, the aftermath of what he believed was going to happen to him; I am asking the question, generally? 
A. Yes. There was no ambiguity on his account, either to me or in his evidence yesterday. He gave quite a clear account of what he said occurred. There is no uncertainty in his account. Therefore, I am reliant on that.""

114Dr Westmore returned to this issue later in cross-examination (T492.3-43):

""However, if we accept the history that he gives that she picked up the knife, she threatened him and he felt threatened then that has occurred independent of his mental illness. It's, as I said before, if he said she was drinking coke, I believed without any reason, I believed, that she was going to attack me and her accomplices were going to, that will change everything because it would be based on a belief without any evidence. Without any precipitance. But he gives quite a different history. He said what I stated. He responded to that in a way that an ordinary person might respond to it. In other words, somebody without a mental illness might respond to it. They would disarm the threatening person. They would jump on top of them. They would try to get the weapon away and some people might stab their attacker.

BONNICI: Q. But would you describe him as an ordinary person? 
A. No the point I was making is that people without a mental illness might respond in such a way and people with a mental illness might respond in such a way independently of their mental illness.

...

Q. You're saying that because an ordinary person might react that way? 
A. Yes.

Q. And therefore Mr Potts has reacted that way, then regardless of all the things that Mr Potts suffers from, are you basing your opinion on that equation?
A. What I'm saying is what I said before but in a different way, people with a mental illness sometimes commit offences in the context of their mental illnesses, but people with mental illnesses can also commit offences separate and independently from their mental illness. And based on his history that's what I believed occurred in this particular case.

Q. As I understand when you talk about his history it's part of his history that led you to be believe he was mentally ill at the time?
A. That's correct, but his account of the incident, which is what we are here for today is not psychotic. It's a non-psychotic explanation for what he did.""

115Dr Westmore also observed that there was ""no obvious link in his account and his mental illness"" (T493.12). He said ""I have agreed that he was mentally ill at the time on the balance of probability, but we are still looking for some link and he needs to give us the history that will enable us to build the bridge between his mental illness and the offence"" (T493.34).

116I have had regard, as no doubt did the jury, to the evidence that the Appellant had apparently taken less than the recommended therapeutic dose of his antipsychotic medication as at 14 September 2008. The primary issue was whether the requisite nexus had been demonstrated between the Appellant's condition and his offending behaviour. 

117I accept the Crown submission that the jury was well informed as to the Appellant's mental health history, and were well assisted by psychiatric opinion as to whether there was a causal link between the offending and any abnormality of mind. 

118The jury were comprehensively and appropriately directed on the partial defence of substantial impairment, in a manner not challenged on appeal (SU61-86). The expert evidence was summarised in detail by the trial Judge during the summing up (SU74-86). 

119It was clearly open to the jury on the evidence not to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there was a causal link between the Appellant's offending conduct and any abnormality of mind. 

120This conclusion was available on different bases:

(a)if the jury did not accept, on the balance of probabilities, the Appellant's evidence that he heard voices before the homicide, or

(b)even if the jury believed that evidence, they accepted the evidence of Dr Westmore, and not Dr Allnutt, concerning the relevance of the voices and the absence of a causal nexus.

121The s.23A issue can be resolved adversely to the Appellant without reaching the s.23A(1)(b) element. Viewed in this way, any concerns raised on the Appellant's behalf under Conviction Ground 1 would have no practical operation. Even if the jury accepted that the Appellant heard voices before the homicide, it was open to the jury to find the analysis of Dr Westmore more persuasive, so that the Appellant would fail on the first element in s.23A(1)(a) of the Act.

122I do not think that the Appellant's arguments in support of this ground of appeal are assisted by reference to the trial Judge's comment made during the trial, and before the Appellant and the psychiatrists had given evidence (see [54] above). This Court should not exercise its appellate function under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by reference to a comment made by the trial Judge at an early stage of the trial, and before the relevant body of evidence had been given in the presence of the jury: cf R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340; 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-475 [32].

123Having undertaken an independent assessment of the evidence adduced at the trial, and taking into account the fact that this Court has not observed the witnesses (in particular, the Appellant) give evidence, I am satisfied that, applying the relevant test, it was open on the evidence to the jury not to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the Appellant was substantially impaired. I express the view that I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Appellant has made out the elements of substantial impairment under s.23A Crimes Act 1900 so as to warrant a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. I have no doubt that the Appellant was rightly convicted of murder.

124I would reject the second conviction ground of appeal.

Sentence Ground 1 - The Mental Illness Issues

Submissions

125Mr Ramage QC submitted that the sentencing Judge had failed to take into account on sentence the fact that the Appellant's mental illness rendered him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, and the fact that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on him, so that this factor ought operate to reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence. Reference was made to the line of authority summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]-[178]. 

126It was submitted that the Appellant clearly suffered from a long-standing mental illness, but that the sentencing Judge had failed to take this factor into account, in the ways referred to in this ground of appeal.

127The Crown submitted that the Appellant's mental illness permeated the remarks on sentence, and that his Honour was clearly cognisant of relevant considerations concerning the impact of mental illness on sentence. The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had proper regard to relevant sentencing principles in taking into account the relevance of the Appellant's mental illness on sentence. Although the sentencing Judge approached the question of sentence with an expectation that the Appellant would be assessed after sentence and almost certainly made a forensic patient, there was no evidence to establish that the Appellant's conditions of confinement would be any different to those which he has experienced, or is likely to experience, in the balance of his sentence.

128The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the exercise of sentencing discretion in accordance with the first sentencing ground of appeal. 

Decision

129The submissions for the Appellant in support of this ground of appeal carry with them the expectation that automatic consequences will follow on sentence where an offender suffers from a mental disorder. This proposition is not correct. 

130The observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 have particular application to the circumstance of the present case:

""Persons suffering from mental disorders frequently come into collision with the criminal justice system. Sentencing such persons commonly confronts judicial officers with the need to make a sensitive discretionary decisions. Sentencing is essentially a discretionary exercise requiring consideration of the extremely variable facts and circumstances of individual cases and the application to those facts and circumstances to the principles laid down by statute or established by the common law. The principles to be applied in sentencing are in turn developed by reference to the purposes of criminal punishment. Those purposes were set by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 as follows: 'protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform'.

A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the Court in the case of Veen No 2. Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.

It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.""

131The sentencing Judge in this case was very much alive to the relevance of the Appellant's mental illness to sentence. His Honour made detailed findings of fact with respect to the offence (at [9]-[29]). His Honour then turned to the characterisation of the offence of murder in this case. Reference was made (at [30]-[31]) to the competing submissions. 

132It is important to keep in mind that the Crown submission on sentence before Kirby J was that a sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed in this case under s.61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Defence counsel responded that mental illness was relevant to sentence, and that it was appropriate to characterise the offence as just below or at the mid-range of seriousness. 

133Before characterising the offence, his Honour summarised the psychiatric and social history of the Appellant, and referred to the opinions of the forensic psychiatrists who gave evidence at trial (at [32]-[41]).

134Having undertaken that analysis, his Honour turned to the conclusions to be reached on the mental illness issue in light of the psychiatric evidence. After referring to the evidence of the psychiatrists, Kirby J concluded that the Appellant was ""significantly impaired"". His Honour continued at [44]-[46]:

""44That impairment was especially important in the lead up to the fight and his perception of whether he was under threat from Ms King and her friends. His response to that perception, however, owed as much to his aggressive personality as his impairment.

45Returning to the issue of the characterisation of the offence. The objective circumstances were extremely grave. Mr Potts overpowered and disarmed his much smaller victim. While she was face down, and pinned to the floor by his considerable body weight, he stabbed her twice in the back. One wound penetrated 33 cm, passing through vital organs. One would infer an intention to kill. She having died, he then undressed her and had sexual intercourse with her.

46What, then, can be said in mitigation? The crime was certainly unplanned. It evolved out of their interaction in his flat. I accept that Mr Potts' actions were impulsive and the result of decisions made when things were happening fast. But, it was a brutal crime. Nonetheless, the presence of circumstances of mitigation and especially the impairment of Mr Potts, take the matter out of the worst class of case (cf R v Garforth (supra)). A mandatory life sentence is therefore not appropriate.""

135Accordingly, it may be seen that the Appellant's mental health issues had been taken into account by the sentencing Judge in reaching a conclusion that a life sentence was not appropriate.

136As in R v Fraser [2005] NSWCCA 77 at [24]-[25], a diminution in the extent of the Appellant's culpability for murder, by reason of his mental state, was not incompatible with the jury verdict that the mental state, as assessed by them, did not reduce culpability from murder to the lesser crime of manslaughter.

137Where factors have been taken into account in an offender's favour to assist a finding that a life sentence under s.61 is not appropriate, the Court has said that care should be taken not to double count those factors again in the offender's favour on sentence: R v Lo [2003] NSWCCA 313 at [1], [31]-[32]; R v Fraser at [44]; Ta'ala v R [2008] NSWCCA 132 at [30]-[34]. In the present case, a further finding which mitigated penalty by reference to the Appellant's history of mental illness (and its consequences) would run the risk of unwarranted double counting on sentence in the Appellant's favour.

138Thereafter, Kirby J turned to other sentencing considerations, including the protection of the community and the issue of dangerousness. After reference was made to relevant authorities, his Honour observed (at [51]-[54]) that the Appellant had been assessed on his release from gaol in 2006 as being a higher risk for future offending, a forecast which his Honour observed ""regrettably proved to be accurate"". 

139Reference was made to the opinions of Dr Westmore and Dr Greenberg that the Appellant constituted an ""extremely high"" risk of further violent offending, with Dr Allnutt expressing the opinion that the Appellant represented a ""high risk of further violent crimes"". His Honour accepted this evidence and found that there was no question that the Appellant represented a high risk of further violent crime.

140In view of opinions expressed by a number of the psychiatrists in the sentencing proceedings, his Honour observed (at [55]) that the Appellant would almost certainly be made a forensic patient, where he would receive appropriate treatment. 

141The fact that an assessment of the Appellant as a forensic patient did not come to pass was the subject of an application for leave to add a further ground of appeal against sentence. The Court determined that leave ought not be granted to rely upon this ground, for reasons which will appear later in this judgment. The present ground of appeal is to be determined by reference to the complaints contained within that ground.

142It is important to keep in mind that the primary issue to be determined on sentence in this case was whether a sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed in accordance with s.61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Such a sentence is to be imposed ""if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"". 

143His Honour determined that such a sentence should not be imposed in this case. In reaching this view, reliance was placed upon the evidence of the Appellant's history of mental illness. 

144No submission was made at the sentencing hearing before Kirby J that less weight should be given to general deterrence because of the Appellant's history of mental illness. It is clear, however, that his Honour was alive to the various factors which may (but not must) be taken into account on sentence of an offender with a history of mental illness. 

145Even if the issue had been expressly submitted to the sentencing Judge, it is apparent that a finding of mental illness does not lead to an automatic reduction in the weight to be given to general deterrence in a particular case: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51-52; R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at 198-200 [109]-[115]. 

146To my mind, no error has been demonstrated in accordance with Sentence Ground 1(i). 

147Nor, in my view, has error been demonstrated as alleged in Sentence Ground 1(ii). No specific submission was made at the sentencing hearing that any sentence would weigh more heavily upon the Appellant because of his history of mental illness. The most favourable approach for the Appellant on this issue is that, given the indications of the psychiatrists in reports before the sentencing Judge, there was a strong prospect that the Appellant would be assessed as a forensic patient. 

148It should be observed, however, that the Appellant was not capable of falling within the definition of ""forensic patient"" in s.42 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The Appellant had been convicted of murder and was to be sentenced for that crime. At best, the Appellant could, if a relevant order was made, fall within the definition of ""correctional patient"" under s.41(1) of that Act. For that to happen, it would be necessary for the Appellant to be assessed, and made the subject of an order that he be transferred from a correctional centre to a mental health facility under s.55 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. Accordingly, the concept of ""forensic patient"" was and remains irrelevant to this case.

149No evidence was adduced at the sentencing hearing which would permit a finding that the Appellant would find custody more onerous because of his mental illness: cf R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97 at [179]-[180]; R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202 at [26]-[28].

150Critically, Justice Health is a statutory health corporation with functions including the provision of health services to offenders and persons in custody: s.236A Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999; R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186 at [125]-[126]. An offender's illness is relevant to the question of sentence, but it does not operate automatically to reduce sentence: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [18]; R v Achurch at [117]ff. 

151Further, the Appellant was and remains dangerous so that this consideration may overshadow, if not overwhelm, other factors of a generally mitigating type which arise on sentence for an offender with a history of mental illness: Rigby v R [2006] NSWCCA 205 at [74]-[77]; R v Hamid at 200-202 [117]-[123].

152I would reject the first ground of appeal on sentence.

Sentence Ground 2 - The Claim of Manifest Excess

Submissions

153Mr Ramage QC submitted that the sentence imposed upon the Appellant was manifestly excessive. He relied upon the finding of the sentencing Judge that the Appellant was ""significantly impaired"" by virtue of his mental illness. In light of this finding, and the evidence of the Appellant's history of mental illness, it was submitted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

154The Crown submitted that the sentence was clearly open to the sentencing Judge and that manifest excess had not been demonstrated.

Decision

155To establish a ground claiming manifest excess, it is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that the sentence under challenge is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]-[29]. 

156His Honour made careful findings concerning the objective gravity of the Appellant's crime, with those findings not being challenged on appeal to this Court.

157The Appellant was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offence, with two good behaviour bonds for offences of assault and larceny imposed on 1 April 2008 being current. Further, the Appellant's conduct in having sexual intercourse with the deceased after killing her did not assist the Appellant on sentence: Director of Public Prosecutions v England [1999] VSCA 95; [1999] 2 VR 258; R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61]. 

158Although accepting that the Appellant's mental illness was relevant to his understanding of the events, the sentencing Judge found (at [44]) that the Appellant's conduct owed as much to his aggressive personality as to his impairment. 

159In the circumstances of this case, a most significant factor on sentence was the protection of the community. The Appellant had stabbed his father to death in a frenzied attack in 2000. Despite very substantial treatment measures being taken with respect to the Appellant both in custody and upon his return to the community, he demonstrated an ongoing pattern of violent conduct. Despite being subject to medical treatment within the community, including the prescription of antipsychotic medication, the Appellant killed again in September 2008. 

160At the age of 40 years, he had killed twice and the psychiatric evidence was to the effect that he was a high or extremely high risk of further violent conduct. 

161In 2001, clearly by reference to evidence then before the Court, Hidden J said that he did ""not think that [the Appellant] is a continuing danger to society"" with the crime arising ""from his relationship with his father and I think it unlikely that he would re-offend in such a violent manner"": R v Potts [2001] NSWSC 753 at [8]. It was emphasised that the Appellant should ""comply with an appropriate regime of treatment and avoid drug abuse"" (at [8]).

162As with Mr Veen, doubt as to the Appellant's future dangerousness was ""dramatically dispelled"" by the killing on 14 September 2008: Veen v The Queen [No. 2] at 478.

163Even before then, the Appellant had displayed, from 2004, a propensity for violent conduct despite intensive efforts at psychiatric treatment. The Appellant was ""treatment-resistant"", and he killed again in September 2008.

164In several respects, the Appellant's circumstances are closely aligned to those of Mr Veen. In a much-cited passage which resonates in this case, Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in Veen v The Queen [No. 2] at 476-477:

""...sentencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality. In Veen (No 1) Murphy J alone thought it 'a distortion of the criminal law to sentence people to longer terms because they ... have diminished responsibility'. As Baroness Wootton points out, if that approach were adopted in culpable homicide the legally insane would be detained indefinitely, those whose responsibility was severely diminished would be released in the shortest time even though they were a grave danger to society, and those whose responsibility was diminished to a lesser extent would be longest detained even though their release would pose little danger to society. Such a theory of sentencing would prove adventitious in practice and destructive of public confidence in the processes of criminal justice. In this case, Hunt J took into account the relevant purposes of criminal punishment in determining the sentence to be imposed. He was entitled to attach great weight to the protection of society as a factor in that determination.""

165Kirby J applied similar reasoning in this case. No error has been identified in this respect.

166This is not a case where, at the time of sentence by Kirby J, there was room for debate concerning the future dangerousness of the Appellant.

167In Fardon v Attorney General for the State of Queensland [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575, Gleeson CJ observed at 589-590 [12]:

""No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of Veen shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles, and some legislative regimes, permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release.""

168A sentencing Judge is entitled to take the circumstances of the offence into account, together with the offender's prior history, in determining the question of future dangerousness. In R v Garforth (NSWCCA, 23 May 1994, unreported), the Court (Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Mathews JJ) said: 

""We return to the concepts of dangerousness and rehabilitation. It is now well settled that the protection of society - and hence the potential dangerousness of the offender - is a relevant matter on sentence. (Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465). This factor cannot be given such weight as to lead to a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. But it can be used to offset a potentially mitigating feature of the case, such as the offender's mental condition, which might otherwise have led to a reduction of penalty.""

169As the sentencing Judge concluded, this was a case where these principles had direct application. In my view, far from the sentence imposed upon the Appellant being manifestly excessive, the sentence constituted a measured and restrained sentencing response to the Appellant's most serious crime and his dangerousness, so that the protection of the community became a most important factor on sentence.

170This ground of appeal has not been made good.

Application for Leave to Add a Sentence Ground of Appeal at the Hearing

171At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Ramage QC sought leave to add a further ground of appeal on sentence, which contended that the sentencing process had miscarried by reason of the sentencing Judge being misled concerning the likely assessment of the Appellant as a forensic patient whilst in custody. 

172Mr Ramage QC sought to read the affidavit of his instructing solicitor, Peter Richard Baker, sworn 13 March 2012. This affidavit appeared to assert, on a hearsay basis sourced to the Appellant, the fact that the Appellant had received limited treatment whilst in custody, and that he was presently housed at the Goulburn Correctional Centre. The affidavit was said to go to the issue of what had happened to the Appellant since he had been sentenced on 23 July 2010 and, in particular, what medical and psychiatric treatment he had or had not received in custody. 

173The Crown objected to this affidavit being read upon the basis that it constituted fresh evidence. In the event that the affidavit of Mr Baker was allowed, the Crown sought to read an affidavit of Miriam Rottenberg affirmed 15 March 2012 concerning the Appellant's custodial and treatment status. 

174After some discussion with counsel, Mr Ramage QC sought leave to add the ground of appeal referred to above. After consideration, the Court announced that leave to rely upon the further ground of appeal was refused and that reasons for this decision would be contained in the judgment on the appeal. 

175In the circumstances, the Court did make a recommendation that, in the event that it had not already occurred, the Appellant should be examined for the purpose of determining whether transfer from a correctional centre to a mental health facility was appropriate under s.55 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

176The reason for the Court refusing leave to add this ground may be stated shortly. This Court is a court of error. If relevant error is established, then the Court will consider whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. If error is demonstrated, the Court may have regard to additional evidence, including evidence of conduct since the imposition of sentence for the purpose of forming an opinion under s.6(3): Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at 286-287 [10]-[19], 299 [85]; Norrie v R [2008] NSWCCA 185 at [9]-[12].

177The circumstances in which evidence of events which have occurred after the imposition of sentence may be received by this Court, if error has not otherwise been established, are confined: Norrie v R at [15]-[22].

178As mentioned earlier, the Appellant was not legally capable of being classified as a ""forensic patient"". At best, if so assessed, he could be determined to be a ""correctional patient"" for the purpose of s.55 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.

179The material sought to be adduced in support of the application to add the ground of appeal suggested that the Appellant had not been so assessed to date in custody. There was some material which sought to explain what had happened, and what was intended to be done with the Appellant in custody.

180The Court took the view that the Appellant's case, at the highest, involved a submission that he had not been treated as a patient in custody, but as a prisoner held in a mainstream prison. There was no evidence before Kirby J concerning the qualitative difference between different forms of custody in this respect. 

181At its highest, the Appellant's argument would be that from the time of his sentencing in July 2010 until the hearing of this appeal in March 2012, he had not been housed in a manner which it seems the sentencing Judge anticipated. 

182It is the case that the Appellant was capable of being assessed under s.55 of the Act at any time. Pursuant to this Court's recommendation, it may have happened already. Whether the Appellant was transferred under that section, of course, would be a matter entirely for the relevant medical and custodial authorities. 

183The point, however, is that this is not a situation where the evidence demonstrates greater hardship for the Appellant in custody because of his mental illness. The form of custody to which he is subject will likely change from time to time, depending upon the facility in which he is housed. 

184All of this led the Court to conclude that leave to add this ground of appeal should be refused. It was and remains a matter for the relevant authorities, Justice Health and the Commissioner of Corrective Services, to determine the place of custody for the Appellant from time to time during his sentence.
 
Conclusion

185The Appellant has failed to make good his challenge to conviction. Further, his grounds of appeal against sentence ought be rejected.

186Even if some error had been demonstrated in accordance with Sentence Ground 1 (and it has not), I would not have been satisfied, in any event, that a lesser sentence was warranted for the purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

187I propose the following orders:

(a)appeal against conviction dismissed;

(b)grant leave to appeal against sentence, but appeal dismissed.

188FULLERTON J: I also agree with Johnson J's disposition of the appeal against conviction and his Honour's analysis of the issues raised by the appeal. I also agree that the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the appeal dismissed.

		09 November 2012",2012-11-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2760428,R v Newbury [2012] NSWSC 1361,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 3 August 2010, Wayne Patrick Newbury (to whom I shall usually refer in these reasons as ""the accused"") was charged with an offence by police. The charge alleged that, on 3 August 2010, he murdered Ross Andrew Tekempe (to whom I shall usually refer in these reasons as ""the deceased""). The offence was alleged to have occurred at a township near Wyong on the Central Coast of New South Wales. 

2After the matter had been committed to this Court, the issue of his fitness to stand trial was raised. That engaged various provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""). After a hearing to determine whether or not the accused was fit to stand trial, on 9 March 2012, Davies J determined, pursuant to s 11 of the Act, that the accused was not fit to do so.

3On 28 May 2012, the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined, pursuant to s 16(1) of the Act, that the accused would not become fit to stand trial within 12 months. 

4On 20 July 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales advised that, pursuant to s 19(1)(a) of the Act, the proceedings were to continue. Accordingly, the matter was set down for a special hearing before me. That hearing commenced on 7 November 2012. An indictment was presented containing a count of murder particularised in accordance with the details of the charge provided by me a moment ago. 

Special hearing

5A number of attributes of the special hearing may be briefly noted. In the absence of an election by either the Crown or the accused, the hearing was conducted before me alone and without a jury, pursuant to s 21A of the Act. In accordance with s 21(2) of the Act, the accused was represented by counsel and a solicitor. In accordance with s 21(1) of the Act, the conduct of the special hearing was as close as possible to that of a criminal trial before a judge alone. 

6The Crown called a number of witnesses who gave evidence in the witness box. They included civilians, police officers, ambulance officers and health workers. A number of statements were tendered by consent and pursuant to a waiver of the rule against hearsay that has been the subject of a separate judgment by me. Those statements included evidence from scientific experts and two reports from forensic psychiatrists. Whenever such a statement was tendered, either the Crown Prosecutor or I gave a very brief précis of its subject matter and effect, so that the proceedings could be understood by members of the public in Court. A number of audio recordings and DVDs were tendered and played in open Court. 

7There was no dispute between the parties about the facts established by the evidence and the expert opinions expressed by the two psychiatrists. At the end of the hearing, both the Crown and the accused through his counsel submitted that the appropriate verdict for me to return on the count of murder would be not guilty on the ground of mental illness, pursuant to s 21(3)(a) of the Act. 

Events surrounding the death of the deceased

8I shall discuss the evidence of the mental condition of the accused as at the date in question separately. 

9The evidence establishes the following. 

10For some time before 3 August 2010, the accused and the deceased had lived together in a freestanding home along with their three dogs. The deceased played the role of carer of the accused, and was paid for doing so by the elderly mother of the accused. They lived at number 9 in a suburban street that it is not necessary to name. 

11As at the date in question, the accused was aged 42 years, having been born in March 1968. The deceased was also a mature man.

12The deceased and the accused were known to varying degrees by their neighbours. Mr Doubleday, who lived a little distance away, heard them arguing every month or so.

13At about 1:30am on Sunday 1 August 2010, the accused telephoned 000. He stated that he was at number 25, which was an address a few doors up from his home, and that his brother had been killed, and his mother was being ""held"". In fact, that stated belief was a delusion, and both the brother and the mother of the accused were safe. Indeed, they were not at those premises or even in the street. 

14Police attended in answer to the call but were unable to locate the accused. They checked at number 25 but everything was quiet there. They also checked at the home of the accused, and spoke to the deceased. He expressed the belief that the accused was still in his bed, which turned out not to be the case.

15At about 3 o'clock on the same morning, Mr Grant, a neighbour who lived in the same street, noted a man was pacing back and forth in an alleyway that was adjacent to his home. That continued for some time. Eventually the police arrived, but by that stage the man had disappeared. Although Mr Grant did not know the name of the man, he recognised him as being the accused. 

16Some hours later, at about 9:00am on the same day, the accused was located lying in a gutter outside a shop. He was trying to get up but was being encouraged by onlookers not to do so. An ambulance officer attended and rendered him assistance. At the time, the accused was dishevelled to the point of being filthy. He also had in his possession an iron bar. 

17The accused was taken to Wyong Hospital. He was treated there by Dr Jenner, but discharged on the same day. His mother and brother took him to her home. 

18On the morning of Monday 2 August 2010, Mr Grant noted that one of the tyres on his motor vehicle had been deflated. The accused happened to be walking past, and said something to the effect that the car looked like a car that belonged to his mother. 

19At about 5:30am on the morning of Tuesday 3 August 2010, another neighbour, Ms Johnston, heard the voices of the accused and the deceased from outside their home. Both voices were raised, and the deceased was calling out for help. 

20Very close to that time, the deceased telephoned 000 from his home. A recording of that call was admitted into evidence and played in open Court. It was obvious that the deceased was in great distress. He stated that he had been stabbed and required help urgently. Despite his distress, he was able to give his home address correctly. He also repeatedly named the accused as the person who had stabbed him.

21Mr and Mrs Todkill lived a few doors from the home of the accused and the deceased at number 25. At about 5:50am, Mrs Todkill woke her husband as she had heard the sound of a person outside the home calling out for ""Mum"". Mr Todkill thought that the person seemed to be whispering the word ""Mum"", and also trying to open the windows of the house quietly. Mr Todkill also heard the person say ""I will get my revenge, I will, I will"". Mr Todkill called 000 twice. 

22At 5:50am, Ms McCarthy, who lived some houses further north on the same street, saw a man standing at the gutter outside her house, very close to a drain. The appearance of the man was, very broadly, consistent with that of the accused. 

23Ambulance and police officers attended at the street in answer to the multiple calls to 000. The deceased was found lying on the porch of his home. Tragically, by the time they arrived, the deceased had lost his life. 

24The accused was arrested outside the home of the Todkill family. 

25The post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had suffered multiple stab wounds. Some of them were defensive wounds to the hands, but there were also a number to his body and arms. The fatal wound was to the left side of his chest and had a depth of between 11 and 15 centimetres. It penetrated his pulmonary artery and his heart, and was the direct cause of death. 

26The home of the deceased and the accused was examined by a crime scene officer. There was no sign of forced entry. Blood was located both inside and outside the home. It was not possible to interpret the bloodstain evidence in order to come to a firm opinion about the location or locations at which the deceased had been stabbed.

27The clothes that the accused was wearing when he was arrested were examined. They were found to have blood on them. Defence counsel submitted that the DNA evidence establishes that that was the blood of the deceased. 

28On 4 August 2010, a knife was found in the drain near the home of Ms McCarthy to which I have already referred. That knife was identical to a knife found at the home of the accused and the deceased. It was also found to have blood on it. Again, defence counsel submitted that the DNA evidence establishes that the blood on the knife emanated from the deceased.

29On arrest, the accused was conveyed to a police station. Various forensic procedures were undertaken. At one stage, he said to a police officer, ""you won't find the weapon, you won't know where to find it"" and ""there won't be any fingerprints on it, none"". However, he was not interviewed, in light of his mental state, a topic to which I shall now turn. 

Mental condition of the accused

30The evidence establishes the following. 

31The accused has suffered from very longstanding mental problems. Evidence for that proposition comes from a plethora of sources. A brief summary of his medical history follows. 

32In February 1982, when aged 14 years, the accused was diagnosed with epilepsy and dyspraxia (an inability to make skilled movements accurately). He was also found to have dysfunction regarding memory of verbal material, word retrieval, expression by way of speech and writing, conceptual and abstract levels of language, and motor coordination. 

33In April 1986, when aged 18 years, the accused was admitted to Gosford Hospital where he presented with acute paranoid psychosis. At that stage it was noted that ""query Paranoid Schizophrenia, query Drug Induced Psychosis"" was diagnosed. The accused was, however, discharged two days later. 

34One day after his discharge from Gosford Hospital, the accused was admitted to Macquarie Hospital until the beginning of May 1986. At Macquarie Hospital, the accused was diagnosed with ""Schizophreniform Disorder with cannabis abuse"". Some time afterwards he was returned to Gosford Hospital, where the accused was diagnosed with ""Acute Paranoid Schizophrenia"".

35In May 1986, after undergoing an intelligence quotient (""IQ"") test, the accused was diagnosed with ""borderline intellectual functioning"". 

36In September 2002, the accused was examined by Dr Corrigan at Wyong Community Health Centre and there diagnosed with ""Schizophrenia"" and ""Substance Dependence"". 

37In November 2002, a provisional diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia, poly-substance abuse, personality problems, and borderline or dull intelligence was given by Professor Greenberg. 

38For about two weeks before 3 August 2010, according to what the deceased said to the police and others, the accused had not been taking his medication. That was consistent with the observations made of the accused by his brother. 

39As already noted, when the accused telephoned 000 early in the morning of Sunday 1 August 2010, he expressed a belief that was not founded in reality. When he saw Dr Jenner at Wyong Hospital later that day, the accused spoke of ""being chased by the Devil"". 

40When the brother of the accused saw him on the same day, the accused spoke of having had a conversation with his father, who had in fact died many years earlier. He also referred to speaking to God. 

41When ambulance officers attended at the street on the morning of 3 August 2010, they briefly spoke to the accused outside number 25. He repeated the delusion about his mother at that stage. 

42After arrest, the accused was generally compliant with police. In accordance with his usual presentation, he said a number of things that are unintelligible. However, it is agreed between the parties, and I discerned for myself from the DVD, that whilst the forensic procedures were being conducted, the accused informed the police that a helicopter had flown above him, and shot bullets through his brain. That was a gross delusion. 

43On 22 December 2010, Professor Greenberg, who had been retained by the Crown, saw the accused. He had seen him years before, as I noted a moment ago. Professor Greenberg is unquestionably a very well qualified and highly experienced forensic psychiatrist. In a report of 11 January 2011, Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that the accused was unfit to stand trial.

44In a later report of 10 November 2011, Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that the accused had available to him the defence of mental illness. He diagnosed the accused as suffering from chronic schizophrenia, poly-substance abuse, expressive and receptive language disorder, personality problems (antisocial traits), borderline intelligence, and epileptic seizures (in remission). 

45Dr Neilssen, who, it is accepted between the parties, is a forensic psychiatrist of similar eminence, saw the accused on 4 August 2011, having been retained by the defence. He expressed the same opinion, both with regard to the unfitness of the accused, and also as to the availability of the defence of mental illness. He diagnosed the accused with chronic treatment resistant schizophrenic illness and substance abuse disorder. 

46Throughout the special hearing, and whilst sitting in the dock, the accused made a number of unintelligible remarks. Some of them were addressed to witnesses as they were entering and leaving the Court. 

Issues for determination

47There are two issues raised by the evidence that call for determination by me. The first is whether the count of murder has been made out against the accused. The second is whether, if so, the defence of mental illness has been made out by the accused.

48In determining those issues, I should make clear the relevant legal principles, my findings of fact and the bases for them, and how the application of those legal principles to those facts leads to my verdict. 

Legal principles

49I am bound by what the High Court of Australia said in Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; (1994) 179 CLR 500 at 517 about how I should approach resolution of the two issues identified by me a moment ago. I have also considered the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State in R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; (2005) 63 NSWLR 490; (2005) 154 A Crim R 349. 

50I asked the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel to provide me with submissions about the interpretation of that case. They submitted that the correct approach is to deal with the issues by way of three steps. 

51First, determine whether the physical elements of the offence of murder have been made out by the Crown against the accused to the requisite degree. In that process, consider whether the Crown has established that any such acts were voluntary, and exclude any evidence of the mental state of the accused from that consideration. 

52If those matters have been made out, proceed to determine secondly whether the elements of the defence of mental illness have been made out by the accused to the requisite degree. If so, the issues to be determined by me are complete. 

53If not, then proceed thirdly to consider whether the specific mental elements of the offence of murder have been made out to the requisite degree. In doing so, I should take into account all of the evidence about the mental state of the accused.

54I accept the joint submission of the parties about the applicable law. At one stage I considered whether I should make ancillary findings of fact, as against the possibility that our interpretation of the relevant principles is erroneous. On reflection, I do not propose to do so. 

Determination

55The first question that I must determine is whether the Crown has proven the physical elements of murder. In other words, I need to determine whether the accused voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased. I need to be satisfied of each of those elements beyond reasonable doubt. As I have said, I determine each of them, including voluntariness, without regard to the mental condition of the accused at the time. 

56I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who stabbed the deceased repeatedly at their home, and inflicted the wound that directly caused his death. I come to that conclusion based upon the following aspects of the evidence. I express them in ascending order of importance. 

57First, there had been some arguments between the deceased and the accused in the preceding months. 

58Secondly, the accused was, two days before in the early hours of the morning, in an agitated state in the alleyway near his home. Later that morning, he was found to have an iron bar in his possession. Those events shed some, albeit limited, light on the events of the morning in question. 

59Thirdly, a man very broadly fitting the description of the accused was seen in the vicinity of the drain in which the knife was located that had the blood of the deceased on it. I find that that man was the accused and that that knife was used to stab the deceased. 

60Fourthly, the raised voices of the accused and the deceased were heard outside their home at, or very shortly after, the time of the stabbing. 

61Fifthly, there was no sign of forced entry at the home where the accused and the deceased lived together.

62Sixthly, the accused was arrested a few doors from the scene of the stabbing very soon afterwards.

63Seventhly, at the time of his arrest, the accused was wearing a shirt that had the blood of the deceased on it. 

64Eighthly and finally, the deceased repeatedly stated in the call to 000 that he had been stabbed by the accused. As I have indicated, although in great distress, the deceased at that time was quite coherent. 

65In all of the circumstances, the irresistible inference is that the accused was the person who inflicted the fatal wound upon the deceased early in the morning of 3 August 2010. To the extent that the Crown case relies upon circumstantial evidence, I reject the proposition that there is a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. 

66Turning to the question of the voluntariness of the actions of the accused at the time when he stabbed the deceased, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the actions of the accused were willed movements of his muscles: see Ryan v The Queen [1968] HCA 2; (1968) 121 CLR 205. 

67In short, in accordance with Hawkins v The Queen, I have determined the first issue adversely to the accused. I turn to consider the second issue. 

68In order to make out the defence of mental illness, the accused would need to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that:

""at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong""

McNaghten's Case (1843) 8 ER 718 at 722.

69In The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182, Dixon J (as his Honour then was) said to the jury in the well-known summing-up: 

""If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.""

70I have no doubt that the accused was suffering from a serious, chronic, mental illness at the time of the stabbing of the deceased. The things said by the accused two days before and on the day of the stabbing establish that he was very much divorced from reality. But there are a number of aspects of the evidence that may argue against the establishment of the defence, and to which I have given consideration in determining whether the accused has discharged the onus on the balance of probabilities. Again, I shall list them in ascending order of importance. 

71First, on the DVD of his arrest and subsequent interactions with police, it is apparent that the accused was not completely incoherent. For example, he was able to request a cup of coffee repeatedly, including that it be served to him at breakfast. When he was standing in front of a bench and in discomfort, he sought to sit down. When he was asked not to do so, he complied. When his body was being examined for injuries, he was asked about some of them, and was able to give a history of them. 

72Secondly, the possession of the iron bar two days before could perhaps be evidence of a plan to injure. 

73Thirdly, the words ""I will get my revenge, I will, I will"" said very shortly after the stabbing may be consistent with a sense of being aggrieved and a determination to harm. 

74Fourthly, seeking his mother in a whisper and quietly trying to open the windows at the home of the Todkills at the same time may be consistent with a realisation of what he had done and a desire to seek help in getting away with it. 

75Fifthly, the hiding of the knife in the drain by the accused immediately after the stabbing may suggest that he appreciated what he had done, appreciated that it was wrong, and appreciated that, if detected, he would be punished. 

76Sixthly and finally, boasting to police that the weapon would not be found and, if it were, fingerprints would not implicate the accused, could be interpreted in the same way. 

77I have taken all of those aspects of the evidence into account. On the other hand, it is clear that the accused has been profoundly disturbed for years. At the time of the stabbing he was not taking his medication. Two days before he held a thoroughly delusional belief and was moved to telephone the police about it. On the same day he spoke to a doctor of the Devil. He also believed that he was capable of talking to his dead father and to God. 

78On the day of the offence, he did not flee the scene, but was arrested a few doors down. That was the case even though he was wearing a shirt with the blood of the deceased on it. He continued to hold the delusional belief that his mother was inside the home of the Todkills, when in fact she lived some distance away in a house that was not similar in appearance. His desire to seek revenge immediately after the stabbing is hardly rational, considering that he had already inflicted fatal violence on the deceased. As defence counsel submitted, it could be that the knife was hidden for some irrational purpose that had nothing to do with concealing the stabbing. Even if it was hidden to remove evidence of what the accused had done, I consider that it is quite possible that the accused hid the knife because he appreciated that he may be punished, as opposed to understanding fully that what he had done was wrong. I note that Professor Greenberg approached the question in that way. 

79It is true that the accused sought a cup of coffee after his arrest and understood police commands. But that hardly demonstrates that the accused had anything beyond a superficial understanding of the world around him. As I have said, at that stage he expressed a grossly delusional belief to the police. 

80Finally, the boasting to the police is hardly consistent with a person who fully understood the gravity of what he had done. After all, if the accused had done so he would have said nothing whatsoever about the knife. 

81In short, consideration of the evidence that points against the establishment of the defence shows that it is by no means determinative. 

82Two eminent forensic psychiatrists, one of whom had the benefit of having seen the accused many years before, have expressed a unanimous opinion about the availability of the defence. Although I am not bound by their expert opinion, I consider that I would require very good reasons for rejecting it.

83Finally, in a situation in which the accused bears the onus of persuading me of a proposition on the balance of probabilities, the Crown has not sought to persuade me otherwise. Again, that is not determinative, but it is an aspect of the hearing that I take into account.

84I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, at the time of the stabbing, the accused was labouring under a defect of reason. He was in many respects divorced from reality. I am also satisfied that that condition arose from a disease of the mind. He was suffering from the mental illness schizophrenia, and had done so for many years. 

85I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not know the nature and quality of the act of penetrating the body of another human being with a sharp knife. Although I suspect that that may be the case, the issue is finely balanced in my mind, and the accused has therefore not discharged the onus with regard to it. 

86However, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not know that what he was doing was wrong. He may have appreciated that what he was doing was against the law and could expose him to punishment. But I am satisfied to the requisite degree that the accused could not and did not reason about the question of the rightfulness or wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not appreciate that what he was doing was wrong according to the everyday standards of reasonable people. I consider that his thinking was so disordered at the time that he did not appreciate that repeatedly stabbing the deceased was a morally wrong thing to do. 

87In short, the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt the requisite elements of the offence of murder. The accused has established on the balance of probabilities the requisite elements of the defence of mental illness. It follows that I propose to return the verdict for which both parties have contended. 

Explanation

88Because there is no jury, I am not required to inform them of the matters contained in s 37 of the Act. However, I consider that I should briefly explain the effect of the verdict I propose to deliver shortly. Both counsel agree with that course. I propose to provide that explanation so that the public, including the family of the deceased and the family of the accused, and to the extent possible, the accused, may understand the way in which the criminal justice system responds to this tragedy. 

89A verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness will be returned on the basis that the accused was not criminally responsible for what he has done. However, that verdict does not mean that the accused did not kill the deceased. I have found beyond reasonable doubt that he did so. The verdict does mean that, because of the severity of the mental illness from which the accused was suffering at the time of the stabbing, he is not to be held criminally responsible for the act that he committed. It follows that, after the verdict, I shall not impose any sentence. 

90But that verdict does not mean that the accused will be free to go, which would be the situation if he were simply found not guilty. To be clear about it, the effect of the verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness will be that he will remain in detention and be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. That Tribunal will not release him unless and until it is satisfied that his release will not seriously endanger the safety of the accused, or any member of the public. 

Orders

(1)On the count of murder, I return a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness.

(2)The accused is to be detained in Long Bay Prison Hospital or such other facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine, until released by due process of law.

(3)The Registrar is to notify the Minister for Health, as soon as reasonably practicable, of the terms of this judgment and the orders made by this Court.

(4)The Registrar is to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal, as soon as reasonably practicable, of the terms of this judgment and the orders made by this Court.

		13 November 2012",2012-11-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2760435,R v Brady [2012] NSWDC 222,"Judgment


1HIS HONOUR: A question has arisen as to whether an offence alleged under s 35 of the Crimes Act, as set out in the indictment, which alleges that the accused recklessly caused grievous bodily harm to the victim is an offence of specific intent for the purpose of deciding if the accused could rely on self-induced intoxication. The first thing to observe is that s 35 is not listed as an offence of specific intent in the table to s 428B of Crimes Act. That might suggest that the offence is not one of specific intent. However, since the decision in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93 it has been necessary for the Crown to prove that an accused who acts recklessly must foresee the possibility that their actions will cause grievous bodily harm.

2In Grant v R (2002) 131 ACrimR 523 at [95] Wood J Chief Judge at common law said that when considering whether murder by reckless indifference is an offence of specific intent under pt 11A of the Crimes Act:

""There is at least a hint in that concluding passage in the speech of Lord Russell that there may be offences involving special malice forethought for which the effects of self induced intoxication remain relevant. In that regard, a distinction may properly be recognised between recklessness where a person does not apply his or her mind at all before undertaking an act and where that person does apply his or her mind and foreseeing the specific risk involved, nevertheless goes ahead regardless of it.""


3Lord Russell was one of the judges in DPP v Majewski [1977] AC 443.

4Those remarks suggest that there is a distinction to be made between offences such as this one where it is necessary for an accused to foresee a risk of something specific happening before he or she can be convicted and other offences where that is not required. What that distinction is and what effect it would have on this question was not really explained. Does it affect the decision as to whether an offence, which relies on an element of recklessness is to be regarded as an offence of specific intent?

5When a final ruling was made in Grant it was made in terms of the offence of murder only. An important part of the reasoning in that regard is that murder was left in the table to s 428B of the Act. Wood CJ at CL concluded:

""I have reached the conclusion that the legislature should be taken as having intended that murder in all of its forms should come within the operation of s 428C. Had it been intended to apply a distributive effect to it so that s 428C was applicable only to murder dependent upon intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, then it might have been expected that it would have been included in pt B of the table to s 428B(2) rather than in pt A.""

6As I have said, s 35 is not referred to in the table to s 428. But when pt 11A (Intoxication) was included in the Act s 35 was in a different form and it was not regarded as an offence of specific intent; see Ilioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [97]

7However, the section was substantially changed thereafter. It was this new section that was being dealt with in the case of Blackwell. Blackwell made it clear that under the new section it was necessary for the accused to not merely contemplate the possibility that some harm would be occasioned by his actions but that such harm amounted to grievous bodily harm.

8It seems to me that the starting point for consideration of the question posed must be the terms of s 428B itself. That section states that an offence of specific intent is an offence of which an intention to cause a specific result is an element. A number of sections are set out in a table to the section but the section also says that the table only provides examples of such offences. Clearly the sections set out in the table are not the only sections that might be held to contain offences of specific intent.

9A simple reading of the words of s428B does not suggest that s 35 is an offence of specific intent. (Note that s35 has been amended again, removing the requirement to prove that the accused recklessly caused grievous bodily harm). Recklessness imports a concept of taking an unjustified risk rather than having a specific intent. Recklessness is an easier state of mind to prove than intention. It has been said that, ""Intention cannot exist without foresight but foresight can exist without intention:"" Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law 19th edition at para 24. That simple statement demonstrates the clear distinction between the two concepts. 

10Even when looking at the decision in Grant I note that Wood CJ at CL, before reaching his final decision that all forms of murder should be interpreted as being crimes of specific intent, said at [33] that reckless indifference to life murder is not a crime of specific intent as such. He said: 

""To prove reckless indifference to human life an accused need not be shown to have specifically intended or wanted death to result, only that he or she comprehended that there was a real or substantial likelihood of it occurring and went ahead regardless. As such, it is strictly not a crime of specific intent"",

11Those remarks seem to me to be consistent with a finding that s 35 is not a crime of specific intent.

12I am not aware of any other judgment or authority on this issue and having considered the question I am of the view that an offence under s 35, as stated in the indictment, is not an offence of specific intent under s 428B of the Crimes Act and in this case I will direct the jury accordingly.
