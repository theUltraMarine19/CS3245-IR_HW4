The plaintiffs are a firm of hauliers. The defendants are in the business of importing and distributing bank vault doors. In April 1990, one of the defendants' customers, DBS Bank, was moving to new premises. The bank wanted the doors at their old premises to be dismantled for use later at their new premises. As the new premises were not ready, the doors had to be kept in storage somewhere. The defendants, through their marketing manager Mr Jason Tan, got in touch with Mr Koh, the general manager of the plaintiffs. Their discussions led to a written quotation from the plaintiffs dated 21 April 1990. This document is of some importance, and I set it out verbatim:
We are pleased to submit our quotation for your perusal as flw :-
Supplying Labours, Lorries, Mobile Crane and working tools to transport 7 Nos. of vaults doors from DBS Shenton Way basement to Bukit Batok DBS and our Warehouse.
We are quoting as flwg:-
A) One No. vault door (wt 500-600 kgs) & One "" (wt 800 kgs) to be transport from DBS Shenton Way Basement to DBS Bukit Batok.
B) Five nos. vault doors (wt 500-600 kgs) to be transported from DBS Shenton Way Basement to Our Warehouse for storage.
SUM QUOTED PER NO. S$500.00 ---$2500.00
These five nos. doors are to be stuffed into pallets for storage in our Warehouse.
SUM QUOTED PER PALLET AT S$350.00 ----$1750.00
Insurance Coverage for each of machinery is insured at the maximum amount (of not exceeding) S$150,000.00 ONLY.
As stated in this quotation, two of the doors were to go to the bank's premises at Bukit Batok and five of them were to go to ""our warehouse"" for storage. Further discussions followed. The two doors which were originally going to DBS Bukit Batok were to go into storage as well as the five doors. The discussions led to the issue by the defendants of a purchase order dated 16 May 1990. The material part of that is set out below:
A) 5 Nos vault doors (600 kg)
To be transported from DBS Shenton Way basement to your warehouse for storage .............. $2,000
B) 1 No vault door (wt 1.5 Ton) 1 No vault door (wt 800 kg)
To be transported from DBS warehouse in Jurong to your warehouse for storage ............ $ 600/-
C) 7 Nos of vault doors are to be shifted into pallet and wrapped with plastic for storage in your warehouse ........$2,100/- $4,700/-
REMARKS
You are responsible for the safekeeping of the doors and any damages caused arising from dismantling, transporting, handling and storage.
N.B. : Please quote our P.O. No. in your delivery note and invoice.
The words under the ""Remarks"" heading are a bone of contention in these proceedings.
On 17 May 1990, the doors were dismantled by the defendants, loaded on to the plaintiffs' lorries and taken to a warehouse belonging to Everise Warehousing & Transportation Pte Ltd. They were taken into storage.
An invoice dated 17 May 1990 was issued by the plaintiffs. It referred to the defendants' purchase order number, and to the transport of the doors to ""our warehouse"" for storage and to storage in ""our warehouse.""
The warehouse shared premises with other warehouses in a common building. As luck would have it, a few days later, at about 10 o'clock on the evening of 25 May, a fire broke out in one of the neighbouring warehouses. It engulfed the entire building. The doors stored in the Everise warehouse were all damaged beyond repair.
In this action, the plaintiffs claim the sum of $7,500, being the total sum of four invoices. This includes an invoice for $4,700 for the work in relation to the seven doors. The defendants deny liability for this invoice, and in turn make a counterclaim for the loss of the doors damaged in the fire. The parties have agreed the sum of $50,000 as the value of the doors. The action had been started in November 1991 in the subordinate courts, but was subsequently transferred to this court as the amount of the counterclaim at the time ($87,000) exceeded the then jurisdiction of the subordinate courts.
The central issue of the case concerns the scope of the contract and the scope of the plaintiffs' obligations under it. The plaintiffs contend that they were responsible only for the safe transport of the doors to the warehouse. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the plaintiffs were not only responsible for transporting the doors to the warehouse, but also responsible for their safe storage and that any damage to or loss of the doors is chargeable to the plaintiffs.
Mr Koh's evidence is that his firm's business was that of hauliers. It did not have a warehouse; neither did it store or undertake to store goods for customers. He knew of Everise's warehouse, having stored his own equipment there. When the defendants asked him to arrange for storage, he agreed to arrange to transport them to the Everise warehouse. He said that he told Jason Tan that the charges would probably be about $8 a cubic metre, and that the warehouse owners would bill the defendants direct. He could not have agreed to be responsible for storage because, in the first place, he did not have a warehouse of his own, and, secondly, storage was not part of his business. He pointed out that he never charged the defendants for the storage, and that it was Everise who in fact undertook the storage. He referred to a warehouseman's receipt issued by Everise to the defendants dated 18 May 1990. It so happened that, as confirmed by the receipt chop of the defendants, this document, together with a bill for a door previously put into storage, was received by the defendants at 12 noon on 25 May, the day of the fire but before the fire. So the authencity of these documents cannot be in doubt. The plaintiffs say that these documents support their contention that the storage contract was always intended to be between Everise and the defendants and not between the plaintiffs and defendants.
Mr Koh is illiterate in the English language. He appears to have relied on a clerk, Miss Lim, to deal with correspondence and documents in English. Mr Koh's evidence is that the purchase order had not been brought to his attention at that time. He said that he had done jobs for the defendants for a long time and the purchase orders had usually been received after the job was completed. In this particular case, he did not know when in fact it was received. He assumed it must have been received after the job was done. In any event, it was received by the clerk and he was not told about it. Miss Lim left the firm four years ago. She was not called to give evidence. I was not told of the reason. However, no point has been made of this.
Mr Jason Tan's evidence for the defendants, all given in cross- examination, may be summarised as follows. He said that when he spoke to Mr Koh about this job, he told Mr Koh that he wanted him to store the doors as well as to transport them. He said that he told Koh that the storage would be for an indefinite period, and that Koh was to be responsible for any damage in storage. It was his expectation that Koh would be responsible.
It should be noted that the issue as to the scope of the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants had been fairly clearly raised in the pleadings. The plaintiffs had clearly denied responsibility for loss or damage in storage. However, in his affidavit evidence in chief, Jason Tan said nothing at all about the contents of the discussions between him and Koh, except the following:
""I spoke to < Koh > and asked him to quote me a storage charge. I am unable to recall what he quoted me, but I cited $80 per cubic metre to our clients.""
He then went on to say in the affidavit that the contract between the parties are contained in the plaintiffs' quotation and the defendants' purchase order. In his examination in chief in court, too, he said nothing about the discussions between him and Koh. It was only in cross-examination that he gave the evidence as summarised above.
It is noteworthy that nowhere in his evidence, either in the affidavit or in court, did Jason Tan say what was Koh's response to his request, proposal or expectation, call it what you will, that Koh should be responsible for storage and for damage in storage.
So far as the purchase order is concerned, Mr Tan said that it was drawn up after the discussion about the storage. He said that the purchase order was faxed over to the plaintiffs. However, he did not say when that was done. He had heard Mr Koh's evidence that the document was probably or might have been sent to him after the job was completed, but offered no evidence to counter that.
What I have said is by no means a criticism of Mr Tan. My impression is that Mr Tan was, indeed, a truthful witness, and was not prepared to say anything which he did not believe to be true.
After the fire, the defendants made a claim for the damaged doors, not from the plaintiffs, but from Everise's insurers. The insurers denied liability and confirmed their position by a letter dated 12 September 1990. On 19 October 1990, the plaintiffs requested payment of their invoices, and threatened legal action. On 6 November 1990, the defendants' solicitors replied, and, apparently for the first time, asserted that the plaintiffs were responsible for damage in storage. They referred to the purchase order.
On the evidence, my findings are as follows. There is no doubt that the discussions between Tan and Koh were about transporting as well as storing the doors. However, the evidence falls short of showing that a definite agreement had been reached that the plaintiffs were to be responsible for the storage of the doors or for loss and damage in storage. The evidence of the defendants leaves a serious doubt in my mind whether the purchase order can safely be taken as conclusive evidence of the contract entered into between the parties in relation to these matters. The evidence of the purchase order, and the documents emanating from the plaintiffs and referring to ""our warehouse"", should be weighed with other evidence and circumstances of the case for the purpose of deciding whether any such agreement had been reached.
It is not disputed that the price stated in the purchase order and in the invoice was only for transport and not for storage as well. It is also evident that after carrying out the contract for the transport of the doors, the plaintiffs left it to the warehouse owners to deal with the defendants in relation to the storage of the goods. This is supported by the fact that the warehouseman's receipt was issued in favour of the defendants by Everise. This document had been prepared days before the fire and was received by the defendants on the day of the fire, but before its occurrence. That adds value to the document as evidence.
The conduct of the defendants after the fire also supports the conclusion that they never seriously expected the plaintiffs to bear the loss. As stated earlier, they looked to Everise's insurers, rather than to the plaintiffs, for compensation. The contention that the plaintiffs were responsible appears to have surfaced only after the plaintiffs made the claim for their invoices.
Defendants' counsel submitted that the subsequent conduct of a party to a contract should not be used to construe the meaning of a contractual term. However, the issue here is not the meaning of a term of contract, but whether the contract in fact contained a particular term. I see no reason why the conduct of the parties, either before or after the conclusion of the alleged contract, cannot be referred to for this purpose.
Taking all this evidence and these circumstances into account, it seems to me that the defendants really have not, on balance, discharged the burden, which is clearly on them, of proving that the parties had reached an agreement in the terms alleged by them and as reflected in the remarks in the purchase order. In saying this, I am conscious of the fact that there are gaps in the plaintiffs' evidence as well. In particular, there has been no explanation why Miss Lim has not been called. All that has been said is that she left the firm four years ago. However, as stated above, the defendants have not made a point of it.
In the circumstances, it appears to me that the defendants have not established their counterclaim. It must therefore be dismissed. The plaintiffs' claim based on the invoices is not disputed. Judgment must therefore be entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $7,500 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum on that sum from the date of writ to the date of judgment. The plaintiffs shall have one set of costs for both the claim and counterclaims, on the High Court scale in respect of the proceedings in the High Court and on the Subordinate Courts scale in respect of the proceedings in the subordinate courts.
