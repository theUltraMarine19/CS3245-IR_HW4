2707860,R v Reilly; R v Smith [2012] NSWCCA 166,"Judgment


1BASTEN JA: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: Beau Alexander Smith and Steven John Reilly seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon them by Black DCJ (the judge) in the District Court at Lismore on 28 July 2011. For the sake of convenience, the appeals were heard together. With no disrespect to the applicants, I will refer to them by their surnames. 

3Smith and Reilly were co-offenders in an offence of aggravated break and entering the Target Country Store at Goonellabah on 23 January 2010 and stealing property of Target Australia Pty Ltd. The circumstance of aggravation was that the co-offenders had committed the offence in the company of each other. This offence contravened s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. They had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to their pleas in the District Court. 

4Each of the applicants asked the judge to take into account on sentence two offences that had been included on a Form 1. One matter was an offence of stealing a motor vehicle contrary to s 154F Crimes Act which is punishable by 10 years imprisonment. The other was an offence of damaging a motor vehicle by fire contrary to s 195(1)(b) Crimes Act which is punishable by 10 years imprisonment. 

5Smith was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 17 August 2011 and to expire on 16 August 2016 with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months expiring on 16 May 2015. 

6Reilly was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 
28 July 2011 and to expire on 27 July 2016 with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring on 27 July 2014. 

7The facts of the offences were not in dispute and a statement of agreed facts was tendered. The facts can be briefly stated. 

8Smith, Reilly and a female co-offender stole a Holden Commodore sedan at about 5.20am on 23 January 2010. Smith drove the vehicle to the Target Country Store at the Goonellabah Shopping Village. Reilly was in the front seat and the female co-offender sat in the rear seat. Smith reversed the vehicle through the front glass doors of the Target Country Store. All of the offenders entered the store. Reilly smashed a display counter at the front of the store and stole eleven Apple iPods, five Optus mobile phones and seven Samsung Digital Cameras. Smith ran to the back of the store and stole two 48cm LCD flat screen televisions. The female co-offender assisted Reilly in smashing the display counters at the front of the store. 

9All three offenders loaded the stolen items into the Commodore; then got into the vehicle which was driven away by Smith to a grassed area. Smith and Reilly then set the vehicle on fire by using a lighter and fluid. The property was apparently removed from the vehicle before it was set on fire and taken to Smith's residence, where it was divided among the three involved in the theft. 

10The value of the property stolen from the store amounted to $4,112.76 and the damage occasioned to the store as a result of the 'ram raid' was $5,599.86. Target Country sought compensation in the sum of $9,712.62. The owner of the Commodore sought compensation in the amount of $1,000 for the damage to the vehicle that was totally destroyed by fire. 

Smith's subjective circumstances

11Smith was born on 25 September 1987. He was 22 years old at the time of the offending. The Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report disclosed that Smith, a young Aboriginal man, was one of fourteen children. Since leaving school at sixteen, he had limited casual employment until 2008 when he gained regular employment working for a local building supplier. Since his teenage years Smith has had a long-term pattern of polysubstance and alcohol abuse with periods of sobriety that have been preceded by the completion of the MERIT program in 2007 and the Balund-a program in 2008. Ms Mellor, the author of the report, observed that Smith who ""comes from a negative background and has amassed a long criminal history... continues to make positive attempts to address his offending behaviour."" Smith had reported that he was raised in a family where the eldest males, including his father condoned criminal behaviour and associated substance abuse. 

12The material before the judge included a letter from the Post Release Program Co-ordinator ACE North Coast which recounted that the applicant had been, since 2010, a voluntary participant in an indigenous employment program run by ACE Community College. Smith, who had been reliable and forthright, had worked hard at maintaining his relationship with his partner, who was very supportive of him. 

13During the sentence proceedings, Ashleigh Aitken, Smith's partner, gave evidence that they had been in a relationship since 2007 and had two children. She had noticed a change in Smith as he now took responsibility for the things that he had done, which he did not do when he was younger. 

14Smith has an extensive criminal history which includes offences of break, enter and steal, possession of housebreaking implements, take and drive a conveyance without the owner's consent, stealing from the person, aggravated break, enter and steal, common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. For an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal and commit serious indictable offence in company, he was sentenced in the District Court at Lismore on 16 November 2006 to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 16 months. Smith had been sentenced in the Children's Court in August 2005 for an aggravated break, enter and steal in company to a control order for 12 months that was suspended. He was sentenced in the Local Court on 25 November 2009 to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 18 months that were suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on his accepting the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service for offences of common assault and take and drive conveyance without the owner's consent. At the same time, he was placed on a two year s 9 good behaviour bond for the offence of mid-range PCA. 

15At the time the present offences were committed, Smith was subject to these suspended sentences and the s 9 bond. 

Reilly's subjective circumstances 

16Reilly was born on 12 May 1985 and was 24 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. A Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report disclosed that Reilly, who is of South Sea Islander origin, is a twin and the second eldest of eight siblings. His parents separated when he was aged two. Reilly's father subsequently settled in Lismore and established a new relationship. He has five half brothers and a half sister and lived with his father. Reilly was educated to year 10. His employment history includes a two year term as an apprentice butcher and various labouring positions. 

17Reilly told Mr O'Rourke, the author of the report that at the time of arrest, he was consuming excessive levels of alcohol and was addicted to amphetamines, methamphetamines and cannabis. The costs associated with maintaining his substance dependence had provided the catalyst for his offending. Mr O'Rourke considered that Reilly displayed a limited understanding of the negative impacts his substance abuse may have had on his mental health and daily interaction with others. However, he had successfully completed detoxification and was discharged from the Riverlands Detoxification Unit on 26 July 2011. Reilly presented as an immature person but was personable and co-operative. Mr O'Rourke reported that Reilly claimed that his actions were the result of poor consequential thinking coupled with what he described as a struggle with overwhelming drug and alcohol dependencies. A further Probation and Parole report was tendered that informed the judge that Reilly was assessed as suitable for entry to the assessment phase of the Balund-a program. 

18A report from Jane Wilson, psychologist was also before the judge. In summary, Ms Wilson stated that Reilly, who was born with substance dependence, had experienced ongoing significant substance issues since the age of 13. Reilly's Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and his traumatic birth resulted in developmental delays, which compromised his self-esteem and precipitated his adult drug-taking behaviours. Ms Wilson opined that Reilly's under-developed capacity for consequential thinking prevented him from having the ability to adequately think through the consequences of his actions before engaging in anti-social criminal behaviours. 

19Reilly's prior criminal history revealed convictions for larceny (2004), entering prescribed premises and use of offensive language (2005), and use of offensive language (2006). Fines had been imposed by the Local Court for each offence. 



Some findings by the judge 

20The sentencing proceedings for Smith and Reilly were heard together. Neither Smith nor Reilly gave evidence. Upon the conclusion of the submissions on sentence, the judge sentenced the applicants. 

21The findings by the judge in his ex tempore remarks include: 

The offence would not seem to amount to a mid range offence. 

The two matters on the Form 1 elevated the appropriate sentence for the offence.

There were no significant aggravating features.

Despite Smith's comparatively young age of 23, he had a serious criminal record including a similar type of offence, but not ""a ram raid type"" offence. 

Smith's background made it extremely difficult for Smith to expect leniency by way of sentence reduction or a finding of special circumstances. 

Reilly, who was 26 years old, had much less of a criminal record than his co-offender.

In Reilly's case, there was material justifying a finding of special circumstances. 

The pleas of guilty were early and valuable. 

There was no reason to differentiate between the offenders as some authorities had shown ""that past records should not affect the approach to the instant offence"" (ROS at 4). 

Pleas of guilty 

22Both applicants complain that the judge failed ""to identify, calculate or apply any sentencing discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea of guilty"": Smith - Ground 1, Reilly - Ground 4. As the pleas had been entered at an early stage, a utilitarian discount of 25 per cent was said to be properly available. The applicants submitted that the head sentences of 5 years suggested that a utilitarian discount had not been applied. 

23The Crown accepted that the judge had not explicitly quantified the discount for the pleas, but submitted that the discount had not been overlooked. The judge, who was very experienced, was not under an obligation to identify the discount awarded for the pleas and there was no error. 

24Although sentencing judges have been encouraged to quantify the discount awarded for a plea, it is not mandatory for them to do so: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 per Spigelman CJ at [160]; R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [14]. 

25In R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91 Spigelman CJ observed at [14] - [15] that although the guideline established in Thomson did not require sentencing judges to identify the discount, the rationale for providing a guideline included ""the need to ensure that participants in the New South Wales criminal justice system had no reason to be sceptical about whether or not the benefits of a guilty plea were in fact made available to the accused."" 

26In Lawrence, a ground of appeal that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to take into account the applicant's plea of guilty was dismissed. In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge referred to the plea of guilty but did not explicitly refer to the fact that he had taken it into account, nor did he quantify the benefit of the plea. Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, concluded that in view of the sentencing judge's long experience and the structure and length of the sentence imposed, that he had not failed to take the plea into account and to give it appropriate weight. The final head sentence had been 27 months which could be arrived at by reducing the sentence of 3 years by a 25 per cent discount for the plea. 

27In Devine v R [2009] NSWCCA 261, this Court upheld an appeal where the judge in his sentencing order did not refer to the plea of guilty at all, otherwise than to note that it had been entered in the Local Court. It appears that the sentencing judge had observed on the previous day, that the pleas were entered in the Local Court at the first available opportunity. At the close of submissions, the sentencing judge indicated that he intended to impose a non-parole period of 18 months, but made no reference to having taken the plea into account in the calculation of the sentence nor did he quantify the utilitarian value of the plea. 

28The utilitarian value of a plea is generally assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence: R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [160]. The amount of the discount is largely determined by the timing of the plea: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. It appears from the submissions made to the judge that in Smith's case, there had been discussions between the Crown and Smith's legal representatives as to whether there should be a committal hearing and as the plea was entered, a committal hearing was not required (AB 82). Reilly admitted his involvement in the offending when he participated in an electronically recorded interview at Lismore Police Station. Mr Cusack, who appeared for Reilly told the judge that there was ""a plea of guilty at the outset"" (AB 83). In these circumstances, a discount of 20-25 per cent on sentence would normally have been considered appropriate. 

29Unlike what occurred in Devine, the judge expressly stated that he had taken the guilty pleas into account. The judge said (ROS 3-4): 

""Balancing all those various matters and adding in the fact that this was an early plea and a valuable plea in my view given the potential evidence available, perhaps it is difficult precisely to calculate the discount given for the plea because when one starts with the appropriate sentence for the indictment offence and then adds in the significant increase because of the Form 1 offences that makes calculating discounts very difficult. All I can assure the parties is that I have taken into account that plea in arriving at what I consider to be the appropriate sentence for this offence, taking into account the Form 1"" (italics added).

30These remarks were spoken moments before the judge imposed sentence. It is evident that his Honour was acutely aware that the pleas had significant utilitarian value and a discount was to apply to the sentence. Although the head sentences do not fit neatly into the application of a discount of 20-25 per cent, sentencing is not an arithmetical exercise but one of instinctive synthesis: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 per McHugh J at [84]. Whilst the mathematics might provide an indication as to whether a utilitarian discount has been applied, a judge's sentencing remarks are a more valuable guide. I would reject the notion that the judge, having assured the parties that he had taken into account the pleas just prior to passing sentence, would renege on his promise. Furthermore, his Honour is a very experienced sentencing judge. 

31I am not persuaded that his Honour did not apply an appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. I would reject these grounds of appeal. 

Beau Alexander Smith 

32Two further matters were raised in Smith's appeal, the first of them being expressed in the alternative to the issue just dealt with. Ground two of Smith's appeal is as follows:

""In the alternative to Ground One, if the sentencing Judge is found to have applied an appropriate sentencing discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea of guilty, the starting point (sic) sentence was manifestly excessive, given the findings made and the circumstances of the case.""

33Mr Hunt, counsel for Smith, submitted, that if a 25 per cent discount for the plea had been applied, the starting point of the sentence was manifestly excessive, as was the resulting discounted sentence. Mr Hunt referred to the judge's finding that the offence was not in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and to the offences on the Form 1, and contended that the sentence was not justified. 

34The Crown pointed out that the starting point of the sentence allowing for a 25 per cent discount for the plea was a head sentence of 6.66 years for which the non-parole period, applying the statutory ratio would have been 5 years. In addition to the objective seriousness of the offence itself, there were the offences on the Form 1, Smith's extensive criminal history for similar offences and his breach of three ""good behaviour bonds"". The Crown argued that the judge's finding that Smith's criminal record made it extremely difficult for Smith to expect leniency or for special circumstances to be found, was generous to Smith, as his record should have impacted upon considerations of retribution, deterrence and protection of society. 

35The applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust in order to make good his complaint that the sentence is manifestly excessive: Markarian at [25]. Intervention by this Court is neither warranted simply because it might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the sentencing judge: Markarian at [28]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57], nor simply because the sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59]. Whilst prior decisions and sentencing statistics are helpful when they assist in identifying a range or pattern of sentences for a particular offence, each case must be considered in the light of its own facts. No two cases are the same and there is no single correct sentence: Markarian at [27].

36An offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act embraces a wide range of criminal conduct. The agreed facts referred to the offence as a 'ram-raid' and the judge's attention was drawn by the Crown to Forbes v R [2009] NSWCCA 292 in which Hidden J at [54] - [61] reviewed a number of authorities that had considered an offence of this type and some emphasis was placed on Forbes in the appeal. 

37In my opinion, a 'ram-raid' is a serious instance of an offence of break, enter and steal because of the inevitable destruction that is unleashed by the use of a motor vehicle to smash into commercial premises and the difficulty that store owners have protecting their property from such an offence. Both specific and general deterrence would normally play an important part in the sentencing task for a ram-raid offence. 

38Although the offence was not professionally planned, it was planned and well executed. A significant amount of property was stolen and the damage to the Target store was not inconsiderable. When the judge said there were no ""significant aggravating features"", his Honour overlooked Smith's conditional liberty, being the two suspended sentences of imprisonment for 18 months and the s 9 good behaviour bond to which he was subject at the time of the offending. His Honour's oversight was to Smith's advantage. Furthermore, there were the offences on the Form 1 that involved the theft and destruction by fire of the Commodore. Smith's previous record included two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal. Whilst these offences were not ram-raids, Smith's continuing disregard of the law called for added weight to be given to deterrence and protection of society, but his Honour confined Smith's record to the question of leniency. This also was to Smith's advantage. 

39In Forbes the ""ram-raid"" had caused more than $16,000 damage to the arcade where it had occurred and an ATM machine containing about $54,500 was stolen. Forbes was charged with an aggravated, break and enter contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act. Five offences which included the larceny and stealing of motor vehicles that had been involved in the commission of the crime, were included on a Form 1 and were taken into account on sentence. Forbes was also charged with one count of facilitating boat re-birthing contrary to s 154G Crimes Act. Forbes was sentenced on the s 112(2) offence to imprisonment for 6 years 8 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months and a balance of term of the same length. Forbes had pleaded guilty and the sentence was arrived at after discounting a starting point by 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Hidden J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum JJ agreed) considered at [61] that this was a ""serious offence of its kind."" Forbes's appeal against sentence was dismissed. 

40Although the offence in Forbes was well planned and the money stolen and property damage were greater than in the present appeal, Forbes subjective case was more favourable than that of Smith. Forbes was not on conditional liberty at the time of the offence and the sentencing judge considered that Forbes had good prospects of rehabilitation. Special circumstances were found justifying the substantial reduction in the length of the non-parole period. In any event, the undiscounted starting point of the sentence in Forbes was 8 years which is significantly more than the starting point of the present sentence. 

41The cases helpfully reviewed in Forbes by Hidden J include offences contrary to s 113(2) Crimes Act that carries a lesser penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Whilst acknowledging the usefulness of all of this material, each case must be determined on its own facts. The cases reviewed and the sentence imposed in Forbes do not persuade me that Smith's sentence was outside a legitimate exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. 

42The Court's attention was drawn to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for s 112(2) offences, but the limited use that may be made of these statistics is further diminished by the wide embrace of offending that might be charged under the section. 

43Smith has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would reject this ground of appeal. 

44Ground 3 of Smith's appeal is that ""the sentencing judge failed to accord the applicant any direct or notional credit for a period of 26 days served in custody referable to the index offences alone."" 

45During the proceedings on sentence, the judge was informed that Smith had been arrested on 26 July 2010 for the matters that he stood for sentence, but was immediately granted bail. Smith was arrested on 22 March 2011 for an unrelated charge (an assault occasioning actual bodily harm) and asked that his bail be revoked. The Crown told the judge that Smith was subsequently dealt with in the Local Court for the breaches of the suspended sentences and the good behaviour bond. Smith had received ""a four month non-parole period"" dating from 18 April 2011 to 17 August 2011 and had also received a ""similar fixed sentence in relation to the additional charge"": T18 15-20. 

46The Crown was referring to the sentences imposed on Smith at the Lismore Local Court on 18 April 2011. The s 9 bond for the mid-range PCA was revoked and a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment commencing on 18 April 2011 was imposed. The suspension of the sentences of 18 months imprisonment for the common assault and take and drive conveyance were revoked and ordered to commence on 18 April 2011, with non-parole periods of 4 months commencing on 18 April 2011 and expiring on 17 August 2011. Smith was further sentenced to a term of 4 months imprisonment commencing on 18 April 2011 for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

47The Crown put to the judge that these sentences were not lengthy and that the sentence to be imposed should start on 17 August 2011. 

48Mr Fuggle who appeared for Smith, submitted that as Smith's bail had been revoked on 22 March 2011, his sentence should commence from that date. His Honour told Mr Fuggle that he did not agree with this submission. Mr Fuggle then asked the judge to consider giving some credit for the pre-sentence custody and the commencement date of the sentence be ""somewhat sooner"" than 17 August 2011. 

49This Court has emphasised the desirability of sentencing judges backdating a sentence to take into account pre-sentence custody and to give reasons if this has not been done: R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245. The decision to backdate a sentence is discretionary. Therefore, an appeal against a refusal to backdate a sentence can only succeed in accordance with the principles in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499.

50His Honour dealt with this issue in the following way (ROS at 4): 

""In the case of Beau Alexander Smith that will start on 17 August 2011 and I say that because he was sentenced for other outstanding matters in my view in a comparatively lenient way, bearing in mind this, and the extra time is not such as to amount to a significant increase, so it will commence on 17 August 2011 and expire on 16 August 2016.""

51Although not entirely clear, it seems that the judge's reason for not backdating the sentence in any way was that the sentences imposed by the magistrate were ""comparatively lenient"". Whilst it was within his Honour's sentencing discretion to accumulate the sentence upon the Local Court sentences, in my view, the judge ought to have paid regard to the pre-sentence custody that had been served before the commencement of the Local Court sentences. His Honour was not sitting upon a leniency appeal from the decision of the magistrate and acted upon a wrong principle. As a consequence, Smith did not receive credit in either the District Court or Local Court for the 26 days in custody between 22 March 2011 and 18 April 2011 which is plainly unjust. In my respectful opinion, his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried and the commencement date of the sentence should be backdated to reflect that period. 

Steven John Reilly 

52Reilly's first ground of appeal is that ""the sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he took the Form 1 matters into account"". 

53Mr Nash, counsel for Reilly, submitted that the judge approached the sentencing task in a ""top down fashion,"" or at least was impermissibly distracted from imposing the appropriate sentence for the s 112 offence by a concern to properly quantify the punishment for the Form 1 matters. Mr Nash argued that, rather than the circumstances of the Form 1 offences being included in the assessment of the seriousness of the s 112 offence, those matters were put aside and then used to increase the appropriate sentence for the primary offence. The judge's reference to R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 and the difficulties in quantifying the utilitarian discount for the plea were said to support Reilly's complaint. 

54The Crown's response was that had the judge taken the matters on the Form 1 into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the principal offence, there may have been an error, particularly if this had led to some form of double counting. There had been no such error; rather the judge sentenced the applicant in accordance with the principles in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 

55The focus of Reilly's complaint was the judge's remarks at (ROS 1-2):

""If [the two Form 1 matters] are properly regarded as part of the overall offence which I think might offend against Di Simoni then I would not have a problem describing this as a mid range offence...If it would be wrong to take into account the two matters on the Form 1 and again doing the best I can on the authorities it would not seem to amount to a mid-range offence but at the end of the day the two matters to be brought into account on the Form 1 elevate the appropriate sentence for this offence."" 

56I do not think that there is any merit in Reilly's complaint. The judge did not adopt a ""top down approach"" which considers the sentence that would have been imposed if the court had been sentencing for the full range of offences (the principal offence and the two offences on the Form 1). It is trite to observe that the ""top down approach"" is not to be followed when Form 1 matters are to be taken into account. As Spigelman CJ said in the guideline judgment in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 at [39]:

""The sentencing court is sentencing only for the 'principal offence'. It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a 'discount' for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence."" 

57Although in his ex tempore remarks the judge expressed a concern that he might infringe the principles stated in De Simoni, he need not have done so. The requirement to take into account the two Form 1 offences, did not involve circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence. Having enunciated this concern, his Honour correctly disavowed a 'top-down approach"" when he said ""at the end of the day the two matters to be brought into account on the Form 1 elevate the appropriate sentence for [the s 112(2)] offence."" His Honour recognised that the sentence for the principal offence was to be increased by reason of the Form 1 offences and that Reilly [and Smith] were being sentenced for the principal offence.

58His Honour adopted a ""bottom up"" approach and no error has been demonstrated: R v Timmis [2003] NSWCCA 158. The Form 1 offences did not increase the objective seriousness of the 'ram raid', but increased the weight that was to be given to deterrence and retribution: Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 per Spigelman CJ at [42]. 

59It is convenient to deal with Reilly's second and third grounds of appeal together, which are: 

iiThe sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account as a mitigating factor that the offender did not have any significant record of previous convictions.

iiiThe applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between the sentence he received and that imposed upon a co-offender, Smith. 

60Mr Nash submitted that the judge gave no weight to Reilly's limited criminal history which is demonstrated by the identical head sentences of the co-offenders. In finding special circumstances, the judge did not explicitly refer to Reilly's record. Mr Nash contended that Reilly's criminal history compared to that of Smith and the fact that he was not on conditional liberty should have properly been brought to bear so as to differentiate between the two co-offenders. Mr Nash argued that Reilly had a justifiable sense of grievance. 

61The Crown contended that the judge did expressly refer to Reilly's lesser criminal history and took it into account in finding special circumstances. The Crown submitted that there was no marked disparity between the sentences of the co-offenders. 

62The judge relevantly said (ROS 3):

""The other offender Mr Reilly he is aged twenty-six, he has much less of a criminal record but again the authorities seem to indicate that records are not necessarily relevant in assessing the criminality of the instant offence... 

In his case that is the case of Mr Reilly there is material justifying the finding of special circumstances.""

63And (ROS 4):

""The sentence I see no reason to differentiate between the offenders, as I have said some authorities show that past records should not affect the approach to the instant offence and I give effect to that."" 

64A marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders of a degree or a kind which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance is required before appellate intervention: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. The applicant must show that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard the applicant's grievance as justified: R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251; R v Kollas and Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491. The plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 said at [31]:

""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.""

65Smith had an extensive history of previous criminal convictions whereas Reilly did not. Although Smith's prior offending did not increase the objective seriousness of his offence, it gave rise to considerations of retribution, deterrence and protection of society, that were absent in Reilly's case: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. Moreover, it was an aggravating factor in Smith's case that he was subject to conditional liberty when he offended. In my respectful opinion, his Honour erred in failing to recognise these important matters of distinction when he concluded that there was no reason to differentiate between Reilly and Smith. The differences should have been reflected in a lesser head sentence and are not explained by the finding of special circumstances that resulted in a shorter non-parole period. The sentence imposed should be quashed and Reilly re-sentenced. 

66Accordingly, it is unnecessary to deal with the fifth ground of Reilly's appeal which raises a complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

Reilly's Re-sentence 

67Reilly has filed an affidavit from which it appears that he is taking positive steps whilst in custody. He has been promoted to clerk of the kitchen and has been recommended for inclusion in a warehousing traineeship course. Reilly is on the waiting list for the Smart Recovery Program and has completed a hygiene course. Custody has been a great shock to him and he misses his family deeply. 

68The maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 5 years. Bearing in mind these two legislative guideposts and taking into account the offences on the Form 1, when the objective seriousness of the criminality involved and the subjective features of Reilly are considered and a 25 per cent utilitarian discount for the plea is allowed, Reilly should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months. I do find special circumstances being the additional assistance that Reilly will require to overcome his drug addiction upon release and maintain the judge's relationship between the balance of term and the non-parole period. Accordingly, the non-parole period will be 2 years 9 months and the balance of term 1 year 9 months. 

Orders 

69I would propose the following orders:

(a)in the case of Beau Alexander Smith: 

1.Leave to appeal granted. 

2.Appeal upheld, albeit to a limited extent. 

3.The sentence passed in the District Court of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months is confirmed, but is to commence on 22 July 2011. The non-parole period is to expire on 21 April 2015. The balance of term of 1 year 3 months is to commence on 22 April 2015 and is to expire on 21 July 2016. 

4.The earliest date Smith is eligible to be released to parole is 21 April 2015.

(b)in the case of Steven John Reilly:

1.Leave to appeal granted. 

2.Appeal upheld. 

3.The sentence passed in the District Court is quashed. 

4.Steven John Reilly is sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months to commence on 28 July 2011 and to expire on 27 April 2014. The balance of term of 1 year 9 months is to commence on 28 April 2014 and is to expire on 27 January 2016. 

5.The earliest date Reilly is eligible to be released to parole is 27 April 2014. 

70S. G CAMPBELL J: I agree with Price J.

2707874,Clark v R [2012] NSWCCA 158,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with Johnson J that leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence should be refused. I agree with his reasons for those orders.

2JOHNSON J: By Notice of Appeal filed on 30 August 2011, the Applicant, Ben Richard Clark (now known as Stephanie Elizabeth Clark) seeks leave to appeal with respect to conviction and sentence passed by Patten AJ on 24 August 2007, following a plea of guilty to a charge of murder. 

3The Applicant was sentenced by Patten AJ to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 14 years commencing on 14 July 2005 and expiring on 13 July 2019, with a balance of term of six years commencing on 14 July 2019 and expiring on 13 July 2025. 

4The Applicant appeared unrepresented before this Court and has prepared the Notice of Appeal and Application for Extension of Time to Appeal, together with written submissions, for the purpose of these proceedings. The Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal extended time for the Applicant to appeal until 30 August 2011, so that an extension of time is not required from this Court to bring the application. 

5On 12 April 2012, the Applicant filed Additional Grounds of Appeal which amplify earlier grounds and seek to add further grounds. The Crown objected to this course, but filed further submissions and affidavits so that the Court could deal with all issues raised at the hearing. In all the circumstances, I would grant leave to the Applicant to rely upon the Additional Grounds of Appeal. 

6Insofar as the Applicant's grounds of appeal seek to challenge conviction, the grounds do not raise a question of law alone so that leave to appeal is required: s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12].

7The Applicant requires leave to appeal with respect to sentence: s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

The Offence

8The Applicant admitted before Patten AJ that she had shot dead the victim, Ernest Richard Clark (her grandfather), on 30 April 2005. She admitted this by her plea, and in evidence at the sentencing hearing before Patten AJ on 3 August 2007, and also in the course of her evidence as a Crown witness at the earlier trial of the Applicant's father, Michael Rex Clark, before Patten AJ and a jury (at which the jury could not agree). She gave evidence again before Kirby J and a jury at a later trial at which her father was convicted of murder: R v Clark (No. 3) [2008] NSWSC 795. An appeal by Michael Rex Clark against conviction was dismissed by this Court: Clark v R [2010] NSWCCA 94. The High Court of Australia refused special leave to appeal from that decision: Clark v The Queen [2010] HCATrans 256.

9Patten AJ described the Applicant's crime in the following way:

""The bald facts of the murder may be shortly stated. On the night of 29 April 2005 the offender visited his grandfather then aged 74. They watched a game of football on television together and drank some beer. It seems that the victim some time between 10pm and 11pm accompanied the offender towards some concrete steps at the rear of his house at 29 Wolseley Road, Bexley, leading to a gate which opened onto the street. From a position on the steps, the offender drew a loaded gun from his clothing and fired it at his grandfather. I infer from the evidence that the bullet inflicted a glancing wound in the victim's neck. The offender then moved closer to his grandfather and standing over him fired a second shot into his head.

It is to be inferred that while the offender made his escape through the back gate to his motor cycle, apparently parked about 500 metres away, the victim managed to stagger a few metres before collapsing in his backyard. He was then conscious and lying in a pool of blood when found there by his partner Ms Jessica Chung, about 12.30am. She did everything possible to procure speedy medical assistance but sadly the victim died from the gunshot wound to his head in hospital the following day.""

The Applicant's Grounds

10The grounds of appeal against conviction notified on 30 August 2011, as amended on 12 April 2012, are lengthy, and may be summarised in the following way:

(a) Conviction Ground 1 - alleged misrepresentation by legal representatives - the Applicant complains that:

(i) her legal representatives did not provide to her a copy of a document said to contain agreed facts prior to arraignment, with that document referring to alleged joint criminal enterprise;

(ii) her legal representatives failed to challenge the admissibility of listening device evidence and the ERISP conducted on 14 July 2005;

(iii) conviction for murder would not have resulted if the admissibility of this evidence had been challenged (successfully);

(iv) a miscarriage of justice had resulted so that the Applicant's plea of guilty ought be withdrawn, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.

(b) Conviction Ground 2 - the learned Judge admitted ""evidence considered fatal to the defence"" - the Applicant complains that joint criminal enterprise was relied upon by the Crown and that, by allowing the Crown to rely upon this concept, the trial Judge had erred. 

(c) Conviction Ground 3 - the learned Judge admitted ""evidence considered fatal to the defence"" - the Applicant complains that certain listening device evidence was erroneously admitted, with the tape being of poor quality so that it should not have been regarded as reliable evidence.

(d) Conviction Ground 4 - the learned Judge admitted ""evidence considered fatal to the defence"" - the Applicant complains that the transcript of the listening device recording was wrongly admitted at the sentencing hearing, with impermissible evidence being given by Detective Sergeant Joseph Maree concerning transcription, voice analysis or speech analysis, so as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.

(e) Conviction Ground 5 - the learned Judge admitted ""evidence considered fatal to the defence"" - the Applicant contends that the sentencing Judge erroneously admitted evidence of the listening device tapes, which had been tampered with and altered from their original state so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

(f) Conviction Ground 6 - the learned Judge admitted ""evidence considered fatal to the defence"" - the Applicant contends that the sentencing Judge had erroneously admitted the ERISP of 14 July 2005, in circumstances where the Applicant had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time of the interview so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

(g) Conviction Ground 7 - the Applicant seeks the exclusion of prejudicial evidence, being the transcripts of evidence which she had given in court proceedings between 1 August 2005 and 1 January 2009, on the ground that she was under the influence of mind-altering psychiatric medication in that period, so that a miscarriage of justice has resulted.

11The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence upon the following grounds notified on 30 August 2011, as amended on 12 April 2012:

(a) Sentence Ground 1 - the Applicant relies upon the same complaints as contained in Conviction Ground 1.

(b) Sentence Ground 2 - ""failure to rule in favour of the defendant, the defence of provocation"" - in effect, the Applicant complains that the sentencing Judge erred in rejecting her claim at the sentencing hearing that she had killed her grandfather as a result of fear and hatred of the victim stemming from physical and emotional abuse said to have been perpetrated upon the Applicant by the victim.

(c) Sentence Ground 3 - the ""learned Judge admitted evidence considered fatal to the defence"" - the Applicant complains, once again, concerning the admission of the listening device evidence which is the subject of Conviction Ground 3.

(d) Sentence Ground 4 - the Applicant seeks a reduction of sentence on the grounds of exceptional circumstances being that, since September 2011, she has been on a non-association order for protection whilst in custody because of her transgender status, giving rise to increased isolation and reduced access to services and programs and employment or educational facilities.
 
The Hearing in this Court

12Before the Court embarked upon the hearing of the application, the Applicant sought an adjournment so that further documents could be gathered and to permit certain police officers and a psychologist, Ms Hillier, to be summonsed to Court to give evidence on the application. 

13The Court refused the application for an adjournment upon the basis that the further material which the Applicant sought to obtain would not assist the determination of the application. 

14The Applicant read affidavits which she had sworn on 12 October 2011 and 4 April 2012. In addition, the Applicant relied upon a number of documents and transcripts in support of the leave application. 

15The Crown read affidavits of John Stuart Stratton, affirmed 2 April 2012 and 27 April 2012, together with affidavits of Timothy John Heenan, sworn 6 March 2012 and 27 April 2012. Mr Stratton SC had appeared for the Applicant before Patten AJ, instructed by Mr Heenan. An affidavit of Dale Ashcroft, affirmed 26 April 2012, was also read by the Crown, that affidavit relating solely to issues surrounding the Applicant's transgender status within the correctional system.

16The affidavits of the Applicant, Mr Stratton SC and Mr Heenan identified clearly that issue was joined on a number of factual matters raised by the Applicant. The Court made clear that it was not essential that the various deponents be cross-examined for the purpose of putting the relevant competing positions (T9, 27 April 2012). The Applicant cross-examined Mr Stratton SC and Mr Heenan. The Crown did not seek to cross-examine the Applicant. 

17The Applicant presented evidence and arguments before this Court in an orderly way and impressed as an intelligent and articulate person.

Application for Leave to Appeal Against Conviction

18The principles to be applied where a person appeals to this Court against conviction, following a plea of guilty, were summarised in the following way in Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 312-313 [32]-[35]:

""32 This Court may quash a conviction entered upon a plea of guilty in the sentencing court if it is demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the Applicant is not permitted to withdraw the plea: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36; R v Van (2002) 129 A Crim R 229; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22 at [33]ff.

33 The onus lies upon the Applicant to demonstrate that leave should be granted: R v Marchando (2000) 110 A Crim R 337 at 338 [4]; R v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 536-537 [16]-[23]. The Applicant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at 46 [39]. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection: R v Liberti (1991) 66 A Crim R 120 at 122; R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [48]. 

34 The plea of guilty itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the offence: R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]. Indeed, it has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [25]. 

35 A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46."" 

19To the extent that the Applicant contends that a plea of guilty was entered and sentencing proceedings were conducted upon bases which did not comply with her instructions, it is appropriate to keep in mind, as well, principles which apply where a challenge to conviction is made by reference to the conduct of legal representatives at first instance. 

20In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677, Gleeson CJ (McInerney J agreeing) said at 685D-F:

""The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows:

1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates.

2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.""

21Appeal grounds based upon the conduct of counsel have been considered more recently by the High Court of Australia: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124; Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 79 ALJR 662 and Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614. A recurring theme has been the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings and the general rule that an accused person is bound by the conduct of a criminal trial by that person's counsel. It is not to the point for an accused person to show that, in certain respects, the proceedings might have been conducted differently, nor is it sufficient to show that some inadmissible evidence was received: Ali v The Queen at 665 [12] (Gleeson CJ). It is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.

22There is substantial overlap between the grounds of appeal against conviction. They may be considered together.

23In submissions to this Court, the Applicant contended that there had been a breakdown in communications between the Applicant and her legal representatives with respect to the issues raised under Conviction Ground 1.

24There is a factual dispute between the Applicant and her former legal representatives with respect to communications which took place, and instructions which were given, prior to the entry of the Applicant's plea of guilty to murder in 2007. 

25At the outset, I observe that the Applicant was represented by a senior counsel and solicitor, both of whom are highly experienced in the criminal courts. There are contemporary file notes of conferences which took place, and instructions which were provided by the Applicant before the entry of the plea. To the extent of any conflict between the evidence of the Applicant and that of Mr Stratton SC and Mr Heenan, the evidence of the legal representatives should be preferred.

26The evidence of Mr Stratton SC and Mr Heenan in this Court established the following matters:

(a) the elements of the crime of murder were explained to the Applicant who provided instructions to plead guilty to that charge (T11, 27 April 2012);

(b) the Applicant informed her legal representatives that she had deliberately shot her grandfather out of anger, although she acted alone and not as part of any agreement with her father (T11-12, 27 April 2012);

(c) the partial defence of provocation was discussed in conference, with senior counsel explaining to the Applicant that, in his view, it was not open and would not succeed, so that it was abandoned (T12-13, 27 April 2012);

(d) there was discussion in conference concerning the admissibility of the ERISP, but the Applicant did not give instructions to object to it (T13, 27 April 2012).

27The evidence of Mr Stratton SC and Mr Heenan, supported by contemporaneous records, demonstrates that careful advice was provided to the Applicant in the context of several conferences, concerning the Applicant's prospects of success if provocation was relied upon as a trial issue. 

28With respect, this was realistic and prudent advice which operated in the interests of the Applicant. The evidence does not demonstrate that the Applicant instructed her legal representatives that she did not wish to plead guilty to murder. Rather, the evidence suggests that it was the Applicant's strong desire to plead guilty, but that senior counsel advised her to hasten slowly in this respect so that possible trial issues could be explored before the plea was entered.

29This application relates to sentencing proceedings following a plea of guilty and not the conduct of a criminal trial. At no stage had the Applicant denied that she committed the acts which killed the victim. The issues raised on this application extend to the question whether the Applicant should have proceeded to trial on the murder count, seeking a verdict of manslaughter based upon the partial defence of provocation. The evidence before this Court points clearly to the Applicant being advised on this aspect that the partial defence of provocation was not likely to succeed, but that the factual matters upon which the Applicant sought to rely in this respect could be advanced at a sentencing hearing so as to mitigate penalty.

30In my view, there was no realistic basis upon which provocation could be raised as a trial issue. As Mr Stratton SC submitted (understandably) to Patten AJ on sentence (T29, 3 August 2007):

""The primary submission that we make on behalf of the offender is that he was sexually abused and that this led him to kill his grandfather. We concede - and it is conceded by the plea - that the fact that the deceased sexually abused him many years before would be insufficient to raise in favour of the offender the partial defence of provocation.

Nevertheless, we say that it is a significant matter of mitigation.""

31The Applicant has not demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice resulted from her entry of a plea of guilty to murder, which accepted that provocation could not be raised as a trial issue.

32In a number of respects, the grounds of appeal against conviction are misconceived. There was no statement of agreed facts put before the sentencing Judge. The concept of joint criminal enterprise had no application to the Applicant as the Crown case was that the Applicant had shot the victim and was a principal in the first degree.

33Insofar as the Applicant sought in this Court to contend that what was said to be an absence of premeditation and planning bore upon the question of guilt, the submission is misconceived. The Applicant instructed her legal representatives that the victim was shot twice deliberately out of anger. The motive for the crime was a matter explored at the sentencing hearing, culminating in findings which were reasonably favourable to the Applicant.

34With respect to grounds concerning the listening device evidence and the ERISP, the evidence reveals that these topics were discussed in conference, with understandable legal advice being proffered to the Applicant concerning her prospects if challenge was made to the admissibility of this material. Having received this advice, the Applicant did not instruct her legal representatives to object to the tender of this material. Once again, it is necessary to keep in mind that the Applicant did not dispute that she had killed her grandfather.

35In circumstances where no instructions were provided by the Applicant to object to the ERISP or the listening device evidence, these aspects do not advance the Applicant's case on appeal.

36The conviction ground directed to listening device evidence is also misconceived, rising no higher than a complaint about the voice quality on the tape. This topic was the subject of evidence at the sentencing hearing before Patten AJ from the officer in charge of the case, as well as the tender of the tape itself. The issue of tape quality went to the weight to be attributed to the evidence: R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82 at 90-93 [29]-[38]. This ground has nothing to do with the Applicant's conviction for murder, which followed a plea of guilty and the Applicant's sworn admission, all of which involved cogent admissions of the ingredients of the offence for which she was sentenced.

37Conviction Ground 7 asserts that transcripts of evidence given by the Applicant on various occasions between 1 August 2005 and 1 January 2009 ought to have been excluded on the ground of prejudice as the Applicant was ""under the influence of mind-altering psychiatric medication in that period"". The psychiatric medication in question was identified as Avanza; however, no pharmacological or medical evidence was relied on as to the effects of Avanza. The Applicant asked Mr Stratton SC (T14.8, 27 April 2012):

""Q. If you were aware that at the time I was giving evidence in Court proceedings that I was under the influence of a psychiatric medication, specifically the anti-depressant Avanza, would you have objected to me giving evidence in criminal proceedings?
A. That's difficult for me to answer because I had no information that you were under any psychiatric medication at the time. It certainly didn't appear to me when you gave evidence that you were incapable of answering questions.""

The Applicant has not demonstrated a miscarriage of justice in the manner claimed in Conviction Ground 7.

38By reference to the principles summarised in Thalari v R at [18] above, the Applicant has fallen far short of establishing matters which would lead this Court to conclude that a miscarriage of justice would follow if the Applicant is held to the plea of guilty entered on the charge of murder and the conviction flowing from that plea.

39In these circumstances, I would refuse the Applicant's leave to appeal against conviction.

Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence

40Sentence Ground 1 suffers from the same deficiencies as Conviction Ground 1, upon which it is based. A contested hearing proceeded before Patten AJ to permit findings of fact to be made on sentence. The Applicant was represented by most experienced senior counsel at that hearing. 

41The concept of joint criminal enterprise was only pertinent on sentence to the extent that the Crown asserted that the Applicant and the Applicant's father were motivated by financial gain in killing the victim. The Applicant denied this and asserted that the killing of the victim resulted from the past mental and physical abuse of the Applicant, including serious sexual assault, and the Applicant's lingering hatred of her grandfather which prompted the killing. Patten AJ was alive to this controversy at the sentencing hearing. 

42Having outlined the evidence bearing on the Applicant's motive, his Honour expressed the following conclusion (ROS14):

""Having heard and seen the offender give evidence on several occasions I regard him as a man of no or very little credibility. I do not believe his claims that his grandfather either sexually assaulted him or was physically violent except to the extent of mild pushes or shoves. I accept, however, that there were occasions when his grandfather probably verbally abused him and this may have upset him and given rise to feelings of anger.

Although it seems improbable I cannot exclude the possibility that there is a reasonable hypothesis that feelings of ill will towards his grandfather persisted until 29 April 2005 and motivated the murder. It follows that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was entirely motivated by the prospect of financial gain.""

43The Applicant's Sentence Ground 2 complains with respect to this finding of fact made by Patten AJ. This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a factual finding on sentence is exercisable only where the Applicant demonstrates an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law or that the finding was not open: Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 at [3]-[9], [33]-[35]. 

44The sentencing Judge did not make a finding adverse to the Applicant as sought by the Crown with respect to motive. Nor, however, did the sentencing Judge make a finding in the favourable terms sought by senior counsel for the Applicant. In reaching the conclusions which he did, Patten AJ had regard to the totality of the evidence, including the oral evidence of the Applicant, which his Honour approached with very considerable reservations. 

45It is noteworthy that Kirby J, when later sentencing the Applicant's father, made the following findings concerning the Applicant (R v Clark (No. 3) at [12]-[13]):

""[12] Ben Clark said that when he shot Dick Clark he was acting alone and out of fear. He explained that there had been a number of incidents five years earlier when he was working for Dick Clark. They took place during two weeks when he was at Dick Clark's workshop at Granville in late 2000, or early 2001. His grandfather had repeatedly assaulted him sexually. Eventually, he had anally raped him. He was, at the time, some months short of 17 years old. The assaults were perpetrated in various locations throughout the workshop. The rape occurred in a small and cluttered room towards the rear of the workshop. His wrists had been bound to a shelf whilst he was raped. The jury was instructed that if they believed there was a reasonable possibility that Ben was sexually assaulted by Dick Clark, such that he had his own reasons for disliking his grandfather and may possibly have acted alone, they must acquit Michael Clark. The jury, by their verdict, clearly rejected Ben Clark's evidence, which was unsurprising. His evidence, in its presentation and detail, was completely implausible.

[13] What, then, was the motive of Ben Clark? There was some evidence of ill-feeling between Dick Clark and Ben, arising out of the short time that Ben had spent working in his grandfather's workshop and showroom in 2000 or 2001. Patten AJ, when sentencing Ben Clark, accepted that Dick Clark probably abused Ben verbally because he regarded him as lazy. He may even have mildly pushed him or shoved him to get him moving. Patten AJ could not exclude the possibility that some ill-feeling persisted, and provided part of Ben Clark's motivation. I share that view.""

46Having considered the submissions advanced by the Applicant to this Court, it has not been demonstrated that the factual findings made by Patten AJ were not reasonably open to him. Sentence Ground 2 ought be rejected.

47With respect to Sentence Ground 3, I am entirely unpersuaded that any error has been demonstrated concerning the listening device evidence, let alone an error which impacted adversely to the Applicant on sentence. I have considered this topic above at [34]-[36]. I would reject that ground of appeal.

48In support of the sentence appeal, the Applicant sought to rely upon her transgender status within the prison system since September 2011. Some documentary evidence was adduced concerning management of transgender prisoners in the custodial setting. The Applicant acknowledged that this issue could only be relevant if the Court found error and was otherwise proceeding to resentence the Applicant (T8-9, 27 April 2012). 

49As no error has been demonstrated, this Court is not proceeding to resentence the Applicant. As the transgender status issue arose only in September 2011, long after the Applicant was sentenced, it is not a matter which can appropriately be ventilated on appeal to this Court: Norrie v R [2008] NSWCCA 185 at [13]-[24]. To the extent that this Court has accepted that post-sentence events may be relied upon in exceptional circumstances, I do not consider that the present case may be so classified: Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13 at 15-16 [3], 20-22 [25]-[32]. 

50As the Applicant is unrepresented, I have considered the quantum of the sentence imposed upon her in the circumstances of this offence. I detect no error on the part of the sentencing Judge in the determination of sentence. His Honour took into account the Applicant's plea of guilty, the finding as to motive (which was not unfavourable to the Applicant), her subjective circumstances, and made a finding of special circumstances leading to the imposition of a non-parole period of 14 years with a balance of term of six years. Having regard to the Applicant's crime, no error has been demonstrated in the imposition of this sentence.

51I observe that Kirby J later sentenced the Applicant's father to a total term of 30 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 24 years, after considering submissions relating to proportionality of sentences for the Applicant and the Applicant's father: R v Clark (No. 3) at [38]-[39]. 

52In my view, the grounds of appeal against sentence are sufficiently unmeritorious that leave to appeal against sentence ought be refused.

53I propose the following orders:

(a) leave to appeal against conviction refused;

(b) leave to appeal against sentence refused.

54GARLING J: I agree with Johnson J.

2707876,VAN DER BAAN v R [2012] NSWCCA 5,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  I agree with Hall J.
2HALL J:  The Applicant, by notice dated 15 March 2011, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court at Sydney on 5 February 2010.
3The Applicant was charged on 28 January 2009 with a total of seven offences comprising six offences of aggravated sexual assault against two victims contrary to the provisions of s.61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of robbery with an offensive weapon contrary to the provisions of s.97(1) of the Crimes Act.
4The offences which occurred on 14 April 1995, being three aggravated sexual assault offences under s 61J(1) and an offence under s 97(1), concerned a female victim who was identified by the initials ""BH"" who, at the time of the offences, was 18 years of age.  The offender, at the time, was 25 years of age.
5The Applicant entered a plea of guilty in respect of each offence in the Local Court on 8 April 2009.
6In relation to the second female victim, known as ""SP"", the relevant offences occurred on 2 August 1996.  The Applicant was charged with three offences of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to s 61J.  He entered a plea of guilty in respect of each offence in the Local Court on 8 April 2009.
The sentences challenged in this Court
(1)The sentences imposed in respect of the offences against the victim, ""BH""
7For the offences against the victim, BH, the Applicant was sentenced as follows:
(1)In respect of the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (Offence 4), a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months which was backdated to commence on 23 May 2007 and to expire on 22 November 2008.
(2)In respect of each of the three offences of aggravated sexual assault (Offences 1, 2 and 3), a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years and 9 months to be served concurrently to commence on 23 November 2007 and to expire on 22 August 2014.
(2)The sentences imposed in respect of the offences against the victim, ""SP""
8In respect of offences against the victim, SP, the Applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years to commence on 23 August 2012 and to expire on 22 August 2024 involving a non-parole period of 9 years to commence on 23 August 2012 and to expire on 22 August 2021 and a parole period of 3 years.  Accordingly, the fixed date upon which the Applicant would become to be released on parole is 22 August 2021.
9The overall effective sentence imposed in respect of both complainants is a total effective sentence of 17 years and 3 months comprised of a non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months commencing 23 May 2007 and expiring on 22 August 2021, with a balance of 3 years to date from 22 August 2021 and expiring on 22 August 2024.
10A matter of importance in the sentencing of the Applicant for the above offences in relation to other victims, was the fact that he had committed two serious unrelated sexual assaults for which he had been sentenced at earlier points in time.  In this regard:
(1)The Applicant had committed a violent sexual assault on a young woman (LH) in October 1996 for which he was sentenced by his Honour Judge Holt on 14 November 1997.
(2)The Applicant had also committed a violent sexual assault on a young woman (JL) in May 1996 for which he was sentenced by her Honour Judge Tupman on 8 November 2002.
11By reason of the sentences that had been imposed for the earlier offences, namely, those committed respectively in May 1996 and October 1996, it was necessary for King DCJ, in determining the sentences to be imposed by him, to consider the issue of totality with regard to the offending that had been the subject of sentences effectively imposed by their Honours Judge Holt and Judge Tupman in 1997 and 2002, inter alia.
12The Crown set out in its written submissions a convenient summary of the sentences imposed in respect of each of the offences involving BH and SP.  I reproduce that summary below:
The charge and date of offence and basic allegationMaximum penaltySentenceOffence 1:  s 61J(1) Aggravated Sexual Assault on 14.4.1995 on BH - use knife threaten ABH - penile/ vaginal intercourse20 yearsFixed Term of 6 years and 9 months to date from 23 November 2007 to expire on 22 August 2014Offence 2:  s 61J(1) Aggravated Sexual Assault on 14.4.1995 on BH - use knife threaten ABH - penile/anal intercourse20 yearsFixed Term of 6 years and 9 months to date from 23 November 2007 to expire on 22 August 2014Offence 3:  s 61J(1) Aggravated Sexual Assault on 14.4.1995 on BH - use knife threaten ABH - penile/ mouth intercourse20 yearsFixed Term of 6 years and 9 months to date from 23 November 2007 to expire on 22 August 2014Offence 4:  s 97(1) Robbery with an offensive weapon of BH on 14.4.1995 - stealing her watch and belt at end of the sexual assault20 yearsFixed Term of 18 months to date from 23 May 2007 to expire on 22 November 2008Offence 5:  s 61J(1) Aggravated Sexual Assault on 2.8.1996 on SP - use knife threaten ABH and victim under 16 - penile/vaginal20 years12 years to be served by way of a Non Parole Period of 9 years to date from 23 August 2012 and expire on 22 August 2021, and balance of 3 years to expire on 22 August 2024Offence 6:  s 61J(1) Aggravated Sexual Assault on 2.8.1996 on SP - use knife threaten ABH and victim under 16 - digital/vaginal20 years12 years to be served by way of a Non Parole Period of 9 years to date from 23 August 2012 and expire on 22 August 2021, and balance of 3 years to expire on 22 August 2024Offence 7:  s 61J(1) Aggravated Sexual Assault on 2.8.1996 on SP - use knife threaten ABH and victim under 16 - penile/vaginal20 years12 years to be served by way of a Non Parole Period of 9 years to date from 23 August 2012 and expire on 22 August 2021, and balance of 3 years to expire on 22 August 2024
13The Crown noted that the overall effect of sentences imposed on him was a total effective sentence of 17 years and 3 months, comprising a non-parole of 14 years and 3 months to commence on 23 May 2007 and to expire on 22 August 2021 and a balance of 3 years from 23 August 2021 and to expire on 22 August 2024.
14The Crown further submitted:
""6. When his Honour imposed the above sentences a crucial factor impacting on his Honour's ultimate sentence was the issue of totality, not just with the two matters he was dealing with, but also the totality of offending encompassed in the matters, which Judge Holt had dealt with in 1997 and Judge Tupman had dealt with in 2002, for the other 1996 offences."" 
15The Crown noted that the sentences in question were to be seen in context.  In that respect, details of the sentences imposed by Holt DCJ and by Tupman DCJ were noted as follows:
(1)Sentences imposed by Holt DCJ on 14 November 1997 with regard to the offences committed by the Applicant on 27 October 1996 upon LE.
The charge and date of offence and basic allegationMaximum penaltySentences.61J(1) Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent on 27.10.1996 on LE - threaten ABH with a knife - penile and anal penetration20 yearsSentence of 8 years - to be served by way of:  Minimum term of 5 years and 6 months to date from 25 November 1996 to 24 May 2002, and additional term of 2 years and 6 months to date from 25 May 2002 to 24 November 2004
(2)Sentences imposed by Tupman DCJ on 8 November 2002 with regard to the offences committed by the Applicant on 1 May 1996 upon JL.The charge and date of offence and basic allegationMaximum penaltySentences.61J(1) Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent on 1.5.1996 on JL - threaten ABH with a pistol - penile penetration (with a Form 1 of armed robbery of JL with a pistol of $10)20 yearsSentence of 8 years and 6 months to be comprised by way of a non parole period of 6 years to date from 24 May 2001 to 23 May 2007, and a balance of 2 years and 6 months to date from 24 May 2007 to 23 November 2009
16On the question of the length of the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge, the Crown noted that the sentences imposed in respect of the offences on SP had the most significant impact on the overall sentence imposed on the Applicant.  
17One way of assessing the sentences, it was suggested, could be undertaken by converting the sentence imposed on BH (fixed term of 18 months in respect of offence 4 and the fixed term of 6 years and 9 months in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3) to a sentence slightly in excess of 8 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months which it was observed would be similar to the sentences imposed by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ for LE and JL.
18The Crown set out in its written submissions (paragraph 69) the following sentences referable to each victim (based on non-parole periods only):
LE:4 years and 6 months (25.11.1996 to 24.5.2001).
JL:6 years (24.5.2001 to 23.5.2007).
BH:5 years and 3 months (23.5.2007 to 23.8.2012).
SP:9 years (23.8.2012 to 22.8.2021).
Grounds of appeal
19The Applicant relies on two grounds of appeal which were framed in the following terms:
1.His Honour erred in finding that the offences against SP were aggravated by the earlier offending.
2.The overall sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case.
Factual background
20The factual background to the offences in question was summarised in detail in the Crown's written submissions, which it was accepted accurately sets out the relevant facts in respect of the offences on BH and on SP.
21Accordingly, I extract into this judgment the relevant paragraphs of the Crown's written submissions:
""FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Offences on BH
11.At that time, the victim, BH, was eighteen (18) years old and had just moved to Granville, New South Wales.
12.On 13 April 1995, the victim caught a train from Granville to Parramatta.  She went there to visit the Youth Access Centre.  When in the vicinity of the Parramatta Mall, Church Street, Parramatta, the victim spoke to the Applicant and asked him for directions to the Centre.  The Applicant introduced himself as 'Jason'.  He told her was going that way and offered to show her the way.  The two talked and the victim indicated that she was new in town.  The Applicant volunteered to show her around Parramatta.  The victim gave the Applicant the telephone number of the place where she was staying.
13.During that initial meeting the Applicant indicated that he was working as a nurse's aid.
14.On the morning of 14 April 1995, the Applicant telephoned the victim.  They arranged to meet at Granville Railway Station at 4.00 pm that day, with the view of travelling to Parramatta together.
15.About 4.00 pm that afternoon, the victim and the Applicant met at Granville Railway Station and travelled to Parramatta.  They walked to a café and ate a meal.  They then decided to go to the cinema.  The two walked for about ten minutes.  On the way to the cinema the Applicant told the victim he wanted to visit a marijuana crop he had growing in some parkland in Parramatta.  When they reached a parkland area adjacent to the Parramatta River, the Applicant directed the victim towards the river.  The Applicant left the victim alone for a short period before returning.
16.The Applicant suddenly placed his left hand around the mouth of the victim and pressed the blade of a flick knife against her neck.  The blade of the knife was about 2 inches long.  He said, 'You know this is a knife, if you don't do what I say, I will kill you.'  The Applicant led the victim at knifepoint to a grassy area surrounded by trees.  By this stage it was dusk and almost dark.
17.Offence 1:  The Applicant told the victim to take her jeans off and sit on them.  In fear the victim took off her jeans.  The Applicant removed the victim's underpants.  The Applicant pulled his jeans down to his knees.  The victim said a number of times 'Please don't kill me' to which the Applicant said 'Shut up'.  He pushed the victim onto her back and commenced penile/vaginal intercourse.  This hurt the victim.  That continued for about five minutes.  The victim was uncertain whether the Applicant ejaculated.
18.Offence 2:  The Applicant removed his penis from the victim's vagina and told her to turn over.  She complied through fear.  The Applicant told her to take her top off which she did leaving her bra on.  The Applicant attempted to insert his penis into her anus telling her, 'Spread your legs further'.  Eventually the Applicant inserted his penis into her anus and commenced intercourse.  Whilst doing so, he said, 'You've done this before haven't you?'  The victim said 'No'.  The Applicant said 'Yes you have you slut.'  The Applicant said 'You're a slut aren't you?' a number of times whilst having anal intercourse with the victim.  He said 'You like this don't you?' and when the victim did not reply he said 'Act like you're enjoying it.'  The victim complied because she wanted to get the incident over with.  The Applicant then said, 'Say you're a slut.'  When the victim said 'No' he slapped her across the back of the head and demanded she say it.  The victim complied.  The victim did not know if the Applicant ejaculated during the anal intercourse.
19.Offence 3:  The Applicant removed his penis from the victim's anus and told her to turn over and sit down.  He knelt above her and said, 'Suck this bitch and don't get any ideas.'  He placed his erect penis in to the victim's mouth and took hold of the back of her head, forcing her forward onto his penis.  The Applicant pushed his penis in and out of the victim's mouth for 2-3 minutes.  The Applicant took hold of the victim's hair and forced her head down further onto his penis.  The victim felt sick and tried to pull away but the Applicant slapped her across the face and said 'Keep going bitch'.  A short time later the Applicant removed his penis from the victim's mouth.  The victim did not think he ejaculated.
20.Offence 4:  He told her to remove her bra.  She complied and he told her to turn over and lay on her stomach.  He used the victim's bra to tie her wrists together behind her back.  He said 'I won't tie you hard, just give me some time to get away.'  He said 'You better not tell anyone about this because if I get caught I can still get to you from jail, I know people.'  He took the victim's wrist watch and belt off her.  He asked her if she had any money but the victim only had thirty-five cents.  She is unsure if this was taken.  The Applicant said 'You better not tell anyone' and left.
21.Throughout the incident, the Applicant was in possession of the flick knife.
Offences against SP
22.In August 1996 the Applicant was 26 years of age.  He was living in the Parramatta area.
23.At the time the victim SP was a female child who was 15 years of age.  (It is important to note that this was the only victim of the four victims who was under the age of 16 years, and as such this was an additional aggravating feature pursuant to s.61J(2) - ultimately this is one of the main reasons these offences received the greatest sentences not because of any error made by his Honour as suggested by the Applicant in grounds 1 and 2).
24.On the evening of Friday 2 August 1996, the victim left her home address to walk to Parramatta Railway Station to meet a friend.  She was alone at the time and it was already dark.
25.After walking for about half an hour, the victim commenced walking along Macarthur Street, Parramatta.  Macarthur Street crosses the Parramatta River at a bridge called the Gasworks Bridge.  In 1996, the Gasworks Bridge had two lanes for vehicles (one in each direction) and a narrow footpath for pedestrians.
26.By the time the victim got to the bridge it was dark.  As the victim crossed the bridge, she was grabbed from behind by the Applicant.  The Applicant covered her mouth with his left hand and held a knife against her neck with his right.  The victim described the blade of the knife as being 10-12 cm in length.  He pulled her backwards and said to her 'Shut the fuck up bitch'.
27.He lifted the victim over a stone wall on the bridge and then forced her to walk forwards down a narrow set of steps that lead to the river bank.  He continued to hold his hand over her mouth and the knife to her throat throughout this period.  He directed her to an area underneath the Gasworks Bridge.  Once under the bridge he pushed her backwards and she fell onto the ground.  He undid her jeans and forcibly removed them.  He still had the knife in his right hand whilst doing this and would occasionally place it against her throat.
28.Offence 5:  He said, 'Sit the fuck up.'  The victim complied.  The Applicant stood up, undid his trousers and pulled them down.  He knelt in front of the victim and pushed his penis against the victim's mouth.  The victim had her mouth closed but the Applicant forced his penis into her mouth.
29.The Applicant took hold of the back of the victim's head and repeatedly pushed her head forward and back onto his penis.  He was very rough and said to the victim 'You better not bite this bitch'.  He continued until he ejaculated into her mouth.  At the point of ejaculation the Applicant's semen went down the victim's throat and she gagged.
30.Offence 6:  The Applicant removed his penis from the victim's mouth and pushed her backwards, onto the ground.  He pulled her legs apart and positioned himself on his knees between her legs.  He pulled her underpants to the side with force and placed a number of his fingers inside her vagina.  The victim could feel at least three fingers inside her vagina.  The Applicant initially held his fingers still inside her vagina but then he moved his fingers around inside her up and down and side-to-side.  The Applicant said, 'You're a tight little slut aren't you.'  The finger movement hurt the victim.
31.With his fingers still inside of her vagina the Applicant moved on top of the victim.  He started to kiss her.  The victim initially resisted the kissing but eventually complied.  The Applicant placed his tongue inside her mouth and down her throat.  He kept his fingers inside her vagina throughout this.  This went on for ten to fifteen minutes.
32.Offence 7:  The Applicant told the victim to remove her underpants.  The victim complied.  He lifted himself off her and spread her legs apart.  He knelt between her legs and forcefully pushed his penis into her vagina and commenced sexual intercourse with her.  He lay on top of the victim and pushed his tongue into her mouth.  The thrusting of the Applicant's penis caused the victim pain and she started to cry.  The Applicant said, 'Stop crying bitch, you can't cry.'  The Applicant continued to have sexual intercourse with the victim thrusting his penis forcefully into her vagina.  This went on for some time.  He ejaculated inside her vagina.  As he ejaculated the victim said, 'How much longer is this going to take?  I am supposed to be meeting people and if I don't show up they will alert the police.'  The Applicant said, 'It will take as long as I want it to take bitch'.
33.The Applicant then stopped.  He stood up, pulled his pants up and pulled the victim to her feet.  He walked around behind her, held the knife against her throat and walked her to the edge of the river.
34.When they got close to the river the Applicant said, 'I'll let you go if you don't look at my face.  You have to wait here until I go'.  The victim agreed.  The Applicant instructed her to remain at the riverbank until he had gone.  He then left.
35.The victim stood facing the river for about ten minutes.  She then made her way back to the area underneath the bridge where she found her underpants and jeans.  She put those clothes back on.
36.The victim made her way to Parramatta Railway Station.  At the railway station, she met her friend and the two travelled to the victim's home by bus.  Once at home, the victim disclosed the incident to her mother.  The victim went to Parramatta Police Station where she reported the incident to police.  She then attended Westmead Hospital where a Sexual Assault Examination Kit was obtained.
37.At the hospital she was also treated for cuts that occurred during the incident; one to her arm and one to her back.
38.At the time of the offences, the 15 year old victim had never had sexual intercourse.
39.The Sexual Assault Examination Kit was subsequently taken to the Division of Analytical Laboratories.  A DNA profile was recovered from a vaginal swab.  That DNA profile was identified as matching the DNA profile of the Applicant.  The DNA notification was forwarded to Parramatta Police.  On Wednesday 28 January 2008, the Applicant was arrested at Burwood Police Station and interviewed in relation to the matter.  He stated he did not know the victim and that he did not wish to say anything about the matter at this point.""
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in finding that the offences against SP were aggravated by the earlier offending
22This ground concerns the sentencing judge's observations set out in the Remarks on Sentences at pp.40-41 as follows:
""Sentence for the Offences against SP
Offences 5, 6 and 7 - aggravated sexual assault
The offender committed these offences subsequent to two previous occasions of committing aggravated sexual assaults.  The offender has already been sentenced in respect of those offences and the sentences for these offences must be appropriate to them and only to them, that is, there must be no element of double punishment for the past offences.  However, it is relevant to take into account when sentencing for these offences that the offender's past conduct includes previous offences of the same type.  The commission of those offences is an aggravating feature to be taken into account when sentencing for these offences.""
23Ms A Francis of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the Applicant in this Court submitted that these observations or comments demonstrate that his Honour ""... elevated the objective criminality of the latter offending on the basis of the antecedents"" and that his Honour, accordingly, fell into error.  It was contended that the sentencing judge acted contrary to settled principle as expressed in Hillier v DPP [2009] NSWCCA 312; 198 A Crim R 565 and R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242;  (2006) 66 NSWLR 566; 163 A Crim R 381, namely, that, for the purpose of sentencing, an offender's antecedent criminal history will not impact upon the objective seriousness of an offence.
24In the course of submissions, particular attention was drawn to the sentencing judge's observation that the commission of the offences against SP ""was an aggravating feature to be taken into account when sentencing for these offences"".
25It was submitted that it was evident that the approach that the sentencing judge took to the ""antecedents"" was to determine that they constituted an objective aggravating factor as distinct from it being merely a subjectively adverse factor.
26It was argued that the asserted error had resulted in a sentence concerning SP which ""reflects a starting point of 16 years as against a maximum penalty of 20 years"".
27It was further contended that a comparison of the sentences imposed in respect of the offences against BH and SP made good the assertion that the finding of aggravation had a significantly upward impact upon the sentences.
28Finally, it was argued that, having regard to sentencing patterns at the time of the commission of the offence, the submission was that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
Consideration of Ground 1
29In considering this ground, it is necessary to identify the principles that directly and indirectly bear upon the question of whether and, if so, the basis upon which the antecedent criminal history of an offender may be a factor to be taken into account in determining sentence.
30The principles in this regard may be stated shortly as follows:
(1)The principle of proportionality as enunciated in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances:  Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354;  McNaughton (supra) at 572 per Spigelman CJ at [15].
(2)The proportionality principle applies so that a sentence should not be less than the objective gravity of the offence required:  McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ.
(3)The antecedent criminal history of any offender may not be used to increase the sentence beyond what is an appropriate sentence for the particular offence:  Baumer v The Queen [1988] HCA 67; (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57.
(4)Accordingly, prior convictions do not themselves play a role in determining the gravity of the offence which, as the High Court confirmed in Hoare (supra), turns on the objective circumstances of the offence:  McNaughton (supra) at [24]:
""... the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions.""
(5)Prior convictions are pertinent in terms as to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie:  McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ at [26] (Bell J (as her Honour then was) and Hislop J agreeing).  This proposition may be seen to be reflected in references in Veen (No 2) (supra) to concepts such as an ""attitude of disobedience to the law"" and to the increased weight to be given to retribution, to ""deterrence"" (relevantly personal deterrence) and ""the protection of society"".
31In this respect, in Veen (No 2) (supra), having stated that the principle of proportionality is a firmly established one, the High Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) observed at 473:
""It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence.  The distinction in principal is clear between an extension merely by way of preventative detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible.""
32Spigelman CJ in McNaughton (supra) at [28] set out the following passage from the joint judgment in Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at 640:
""... A person who has been convicted of, or admits to, the commission of other offences will, all other things being equal, ordinarily receive a heavier sentence than a person who has previously led a blameless life.  Imposing a sentence heavier than otherwise would have been passed is not to sentence the first person again for offences of which he or she was earlier convicted or to sentence that offence for the offences admitted but not charged.  It is to do no more than give effect to the well-established principle (in this case established by statute) that the character and antecedents of the offender are, to the extent that they are relevant and known to the sentencing court, to be taken into account in fixing the sentence to be passed.  Taking all aspects, both positive and negative, of an offender's known character and antecedents into account in sentencing for an offence is not to punish the offender again for those earlier matters; it is to take proper account of matters which are relevant to fixing the sentence under consideration."" (emphases added)
33In the present case, it is necessary that attention be given to the structure and detailed analysis contained in the sentencing judge's Remarks on Sentence.  His Honour set out the facts and circumstances of each of the offences against BH and SP.  He then turned to discuss what was subtitled ""Objective Seriousness of the Offences"" (Remarks on Sentence, pp.10-16).
34In relation to the offences against SP, his Honour set out fifteen matters as follows:
""i.  The offences were premeditated.  (The offender was armed with a knife.  The attack came when it was dark and at a place where the victim could be immediately removed to a secluded location where detection was unlikely.)  It was submitted that the court should not find that this was premeditated offence.  The court finds beyond reasonable doubt that this was not an offence committed as a result of a spur of the moment decision made when conducive circumstances coincidentally occurred, but that the offender, carrying the knife in anticipation of committing the offences, either lay in wait at the location until a suitable victim appeared, or that he stalked the victim until she reached a suitable location.  It cannot be determined and is not relevant to determine which of the two alternatives occurred.
ii.  The offences occurred when it was dark, and the victim was entitled to feel secure while walking on a public street.
iii.  The victim was 15 years of age.
iv.  He was armed with a 10-12 cm bladed knife, and used it to obtain acquiescence.
v.  The removal of the victim from the bridge to underneath it was accomplished by physical force as well as intimidation with the knife.
vi.  Her clothes were forcibly removed.
vii.  Each of the acts involved physical force in the act itself.
viii.  The victim was demeaned and belittled by verbal abuse.
ix.  He ejaculated in the victim's mouth, the semen entering her throat and causing her to gag.
x.  He placed at least three fingers in her vagina for a lengthy period of 10 to 15 minutes and moved them around with sufficient force to hurt her while simultaneously forcing his tongue into her throat.
xi.  The penile/vaginal intercourse also caused the victim to suffer pain and to cry.
xii.  He further ejaculated while having penile/vaginal intercourse.
xiii.  After the offences he forced her, while she was at least naked from the waist down, to the riverbank.  At the time he was holding the knife to her throat.  Although he later indicated that he would release her and subsequently did so, the victim, 15 years of age, must have been terrified, considering that he had replaced his clothes, indicating that he had completed the sexual assaults, that she was about to be disposed of in the river.
xiv.  The facts do not provide sufficient information as to the time involved.  However, it is clear that it must have been a significant period, considering that the digital/vaginal intercourse alone was estimated as taking 10-15 minutes.
xv.  The victim suffered cuts as a result of the offences, one to her back and one to her arm.  They do not appear to have been deliberately inflicted rather than acquired as a result of the force used in assaulting her in the particular location, that is, by interaction with the ground or objects on it.""
35His Honour then observed at pp. 14:
""Again, the offences disclose that the offender was driven by a need to sadistically dominate, demean and degrade the victim by placing her in significant fear for her life and wellbeing, to obtain acquiescence in her violation by the offender's extremely offensive conduct.
While it is possible to envisage the ways in which the offences may have been made worse, such as the infliction of deliberate injuries or being in company, the facts disclose a series of assaults than can properly be regarded in their overall effect as being very serious offences within the category of offence.  That is, they fall at the high end of the range.""
36The fifteen factors identified by the sentencing judge were all directly relevant to assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and none were challenged in the present proceedings.  The Applicant's prior offences were not included in the fifteen factors.
37Finally, the length of the term of imprisonment imposed in respect of the offences against SP does not, in my assessment, support the argument put forward on behalf of the Applicant that it indicates his Honour presumably used the prior offences to aggravate the objective seriousness of the offence.
38SP was the only one of the Applicant's four victims who was under the age of 16 years as at the date of the offences (she was 15 years old at the time).  That was an additional aggravating factor under s.61J of the Crimes Act.  Additionally, in relation to SP, the criminality was because it involved, inter alia, dragging a 15 year old girl with a knife under the bridge where violent sexual assaults were then perpetrated upon her.  These factors initially would result in considerably higher sentences than those imposed in the cases of BH, LE and JL.
39Additionally, I accept as valid the observation made in the Crown submissions that the sentencing judge dealt with the sentencing of BH on the basis that the offences committed against her were first offences.  Secondly, in sentencing the Applicant in respect of BH no other prior offences played a role in determining the appropriate sentences.
40Similarly Tupman DCJ when sentencing the Applicant in respect of JL, being unaware of the offences that the Applicant committed against BH, proceeded on the basis that the offences against JL were the first sexual offences committed by the Applicant.  Again first offending played no role in that sentence determination.
41Also, Holt DCJ had no information as to the Applicant having committed these prior sexual offences involving violence.
42At the time of sentencing the Applicant, King DCJ was clearly required to sentence him having regard to his offending for which he had been sentenced by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ.
43It is clear, having regard to the structure of the Remarks on Sentence, the detailed analysis of the facts and circumstances concerning the seriousness of the offence and his Honour's determination that they fall ""at the high end of the range"" that the observations by him were wholly directed to the question of determining the appropriate sentence for the offences against SP after, and not before, the sentencing judge had determined the objective gravity of the offences.  It is, in my opinion, clear that his Honour's reference to the commission of the previous offences as an aggravating factor to be taken into account when sentencing for the offences was, consistently with the principles stated in Veen (No 2) (supra), an indication that his Honour was taking into account the antecedent criminal history to which he referred in determining the sentence to be imposed and not otherwise.  In other words, having first determined, with regard to the objective gravity of the offences, that they fell at the high end of the range, prior convictions were taken into account only as to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, the sentences should lie.
44I should add that his Honour's observations that the sentences for the offences against SP ""must be appropriate to them and only to them,"" by which he explained he meant ""there must be no element of double punishment for the past offences"", evidences the fact that his Honour was acutely aware of the way in which the Applicant's prior criminal history could be taken into account.  It is clear that he was careful in ensuring that that was the only basis upon which he would have regard to such history.
45Accordingly, the submission on behalf of the Applicant that, in making these observations, his Honour was only ""paying lip service"" to the principle that there was to be no element of double punishment for past offences is without merit.
46I accordingly have concluded that there is no validity in Ground 1 and it should be dismissed.
Ground 2:  The overall sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case
47This ground was relied upon in support of the challenge to both the effective overall term and the claimed inadequacy of the period on parole.
48The following general principles are noted in relation to this ground.
(i)First to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an Applicant has to demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325 per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J.
(ii)This has to be established in the context where there is no single correct sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle: Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] per Hoeben J with Tobias JA and James J agreeing.
(iii)""The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) informing the conclusion reached.  As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence.  And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies:"" Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.
(iv)As with other discretionary judgments, the enquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. Where specific error is not shown the question is whether the result embodied in the order is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R (supra).
(v)The Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it may have exercised its discretion in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge: Markarian v R (supra).
(vi)""A basic objective of any sentencing exercise is that the sentence imposed should be reasonably proportionate to the offence committed and its attendant circumstances:"" R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 at [116] the Court (Studdert, Bell and Latham JJ).
(viii)It is necessary for a sentencing judge to strike a proper balance between the sentences to be imposed and the principle of totality.
49In the submissions for the Applicant, it was noted that the sentencing judge observed that the Applicant was to be sentenced on the basis of the general sentencing patterns at the time of the commission of the offences or shortly thereafter.
50In that respect, his Honour said that the sentences imposed by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ were of assistance as were the statistics referred to by their Honours in their remarks on sentence.  The submission was:
""8.4 Despite this the sentences imposed in respect of SP were at least four years longer than the sentences found to be appropriate by Tupman J and Holt J for the sexual offending in respect of which they were dealing.""
51In support of this ground, it was submitted, firstly, that the sentencing judge simply accumulated the first of the sentences in relation to the offences against SP upon the non-parole period that had been imposed by Tupman DCJ without any express consideration as to the impact that the principle of totality had upon the commencement date and, secondly, that an overall effective sentence in excess of 27 years, following pleas of guilty, was manifestly excessive particularly in light of the Applicant's personal history, which was said to be a sad one, and to his efforts to change whilst he was institutionalised.
52The Crown in my opinion correctly observed that it was not the sentences imposed on the Applicant that resulted in the most significant impact on the overall non-parole period but the effect of their accumulation: Written Submissions at [71].
53As to the sentences imposed on the Applicant in respect of SP, the Crown emphasised two matters.  First is the age of SP, the fact that she was 15 years of age at the time the offences committed against her took place.  Second, the important fact that the Applicant was not being sentenced upon the basis that the offences were first offences.  It was submitted by the Crown that both significantly greater sentences imposed on the Applicant and a greater degree of accumulation were warranted.  In the Crown's written submissions it was noted at [72]:
""In addition an effective non-parole period of 24 years and 9 months for the totality of this level of offending on four complainants for offences that were not far from being in the worst category for this type of offending was not manifestly excessive."" 
54I turn at this point to the issue of sentencing patterns, a matter which was the subject of particular attention in the submissions for both the Applicant and the Crown.
55As to the sentencing patterns in 1996, the Crown noted that in R v Jason Mark Russell (unreported, NSWCCA, 21 June 1996) the following observations were made:
""Although no two cases are the same, we have been referred to a number of other cases where the circumstances show some similarity to the present; particularly R v Lewis (CCA, 14 December 1993); R v Logue (CCA, 31 March 1994); R v Burns (CCA 21 September 1994); R v Baker (CCA 2 August 1994).  Those cases show a pattern of sentences ranging from minimum terms of six years to nine years and each followed a plea of guilty."" (Crown Submissions on Sentence Appeal at [73])
56The sentencing judge was mindful of the need in sentencing the Applicant to take into account sentencing patterns as they existed at the time of the commission of the subject offences.  Indeed his Honour expressly said as much: ""Remarks on Sentence"" at Appeal Book p 46.  He noted the submissions that had been made on behalf of the Applicant and stated that he would sentence on the basis of what he understood to be the ""general sentencing pattern"".  His Honour noted that he would be assisted by the sentence imposed by Holt DCJ on the Applicant as well as the sentences imposed by Tupman DCJ on him together with the statistics referred to in the Remarks on Sentence in those cases.  However, his Honour added:
""The Court will take account of the obvious differing circumstances of each of those sentences to each other as well as the current circumstances"": Remarks on Sentence at Appeal Book [46].
57Ms Francis submitted that when allowance is made for the Applicant's guilty pleas, the notional starting point for them were greater than the accumulated sentences imposed by this Court in R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297.  In that case it was observed, the overall term was 36 years with a non-parole period of 30 years. Applying a discount of 25% to the sentences imposed in Skaf  (to which the Applicant in the present case was entitled) this would result in a non-parole period of 21 years and a head sentence of 27 years.
58Ms Francis also submitted that the sentences imposed in respect of the offences against SP were at least 4 years longer than the sentences imposed by both Tupman DCJ and Holt DCJ for the offences with which they were concerned.  As will be discussed later in this judgment there were however, in my assessment, justifiable grounds for the specific sentences imposed with respect to the offences against SP.
59Criticism was also directed by Ms Francis to the issue of the accumulation of the sentences in question:
""His Honour simply accumulated the first of the sentences upon the non-parole period imposed by Tupman J and in so doing was silent as to the impact that principles of totality had upon the commencement date."" Submissions of behalf of the Applicant at 8.5.
60In the Applicant's written submissions the sentencing results in a number of cases were set out. A number of these are referred to below. They were relied upon to support the submission that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
61The cases to which particular reference was made in the submissions include the following:
(i)R v Bilal Skaf (supra) - an effective non-parole period of 21 years with a period on parole of 6 years for the sexual assault of three complainants on two occasions (sentences imposed after trial).
(ii)The sentencing in the following cases (all of which were considered in Skaf (supra).  R v Boatswain (unreported, NSWCCA, 15 December 1993); R v Roberts (unreported, NSWCCA, 8 August 1994) and R v Presta [2000] NSWCCA 40.
62In Boatswain (supra), the offending took place in 1991. A head sentence of 23 years with a non-parole period of 15 years was imposed for sexual offending against two victims (including, inter alia, the possession of a shortened firearm). The application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence was dismissed. The submission was that: 
""... It is notable that each case was regarded as being of the worst type in circumstances where the Applicant had been, previous to their commission, subject to lengthy periods of custody.  The offending in this case against each complainant was objectively more severe than that alleged against the Applicant."" (Applicant's written submissions at 8.10)
63In the Crown's Additional Crown Submissions on Sentence Appeal (p2), it was observed:
""Where the onus lays or manifests excessiveness
6. In asserting that a sentence is manifestly excessive the Applicant takes on what has been referred to as the ""heavy practicable burden"" of demonstrating that the sentence imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" Dinsdale, (supra). See R v Elemes [2000] NSWCCA 235.
7. The High Court has stressed that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies: Markarian (supra).
8. The question for this court is not whether a different orlesser sentence could have been imposed, but whether the sentence imposed fell within the proper exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.""
64The Crown submitted that caution should be exercised in determining a sentencing range. In that respect reference was made to the observations of this Court in R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247 at [48]:
""48... It is necessary to re-state that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching the sentence appealed by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority; see R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; R v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 to 101. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing... ""
65In the Additional Crown Submissions on Sentence Appeal, the Crown provided a very comprehensive analysis of like offences in the 1990s.  The Crown's analysis and conclusions should in my opinion be accepted as providing valuable material for which the ground s of 'manifest excess' should be determined.  In that regard the Crown Submissions include the following:  
""Conclusion in relation to cases from the 1990s""
What the cases above demonstrate, consistent with what this Court said in Russell, is that sentences involving minimal terms (or non parole periods) between 6.5 years to 9 years, are within range for offences of this conduct - which is not to say that sentences could not be more or less. 
The sentence for the offences of BH was well within the many cases outlined above despite the criminality being greater, and the overall seriousness of the offence being greater. 
In relation to SP the sentence imposed in Burns was identical to that in SP - and this Court did not hold that sentence to be manifestly excessive.  The criminality of the offence in SP was greater than Burns, as was the applicant's prior history.  Although Burns involved a breach of a bond, that could not balance out the other factors. 
The analysis of the cases, can not demonstrate that the sentences imposed by His Honour Judge King were manifestly excessive.  
Indeed as was shown in AEM - even the examination of the statistics at [110] show that Judge King's sentences were not manifestly excessive.""  
66In general terms it may be stated that the sentencing pattern be derived from the relevant sentencing decisions , in my opinion, confirms that the sentence imposed on the offender in respect of the offences against BH were entirely consistent with the sentencing pattern for the period 1996 and accordingly were not manifestly excessive. 
67The Crown's summary of cases, in my opinion, establishes that in relation to the more substantial sentences imposed in respect of the Applicant's offences against SP, those offences were more serious than the offences considered in the cases of MacKenzie, Pratt, Russell, Logue and Baker.  
68Additionally, in relation to the Applicant's offences against SP, the sentencing in R v Burns (CCA, unreported 21 September 1994) represents a useful comparator.
69I have concluded that the analysis of sentencing patterns does not demonstrate that the sentences imposed in this case in respect of SP were manifestly excessive.
Consideration(a) Facts concerning the individual offences and the approach taken in sentencing
70The Applicant is required to establish that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  Dinsdale v R (supra) at 325.  See also Vuni v R (supra) per Hoeben J.
71That is a matter to be considered in the context of the total effective sentence imposed upon the Applicant in relation to the total offending against all four victims involving, as it does, a total effective non-parole period of 24 years and 9 months with a balance of term of 3 years.
72In considering the issue I have taken into account the following matters:
(1)Each of the sexual offences committed by the Applicant against each of the four victims involved objective seriousness of a high order.
(2)The Applicant's offending can be seen as escalating over the four separate attacks.
(3)In particular, each offence involved a substantial level of pre-meditation.
(4)Each of the offences involved a marked level of callousness towards and degradation of the four victims.
(5)The offences against BH and SP involved the use of a knife accompanied by threats of violence.
(6)The four offences manifested a complete disregard for the law and for the personal welfare of the victims.
(7)The Applicant's offending occasioned very considerable physical and psychological injury to each of the four victims.
(8)The escalating level of sexual violence displayed in the four offences established the Applicant as a very dangerous offender.  Considerable weight had to be given in sentencing to both retribution and the protection of society.
73The above factors, in my opinion, had to be taken into account in determining both the length of individual sentences to be imposed and in the application of the principle of totality.
74As the Crown observed, in this respect, no challenge was made to the sentencing judge's finding that the offences under s. 61J against BH and SP were in the ""high end of the range"".  Each of the offences attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  The sentences imposed with respect to BH involved a fixed term of 6 years and 9 months (offences 1, 2 and 3) and a non-parole period with respect to SP of 12 years, 2 years of which was concurrent with the fixed terms for offences 1, 2 and 3.  This resulted in an effective non-parole period of 14 years.  Given the fifteen factors identified by the sentencing judge in relation to SP, I consider the sentences imposed with respect to the multiple offending against her were within the range of available sentences and were not either unreasonable or plainly unjust.
75The Applicant's offending against BH and SP, in terms of moral culpability and objective criminality, was of a high order.  Having attacked BH with a knife, threatening to kill her, and subjecting her to the most serious and degrading sexual assault, the following year 1996 he then subjected his 15 year old victim SP to similar serious sexual assaults, inflicting an horrendous level of trauma upon her.
76It is to be observed that the sentences imposed with respect to offences 1, 2 and 3 against BH operated concurrently with the sentence imposed with respect to Count 4.
77Similarly, each sentence of 12 years (with non-parole periods of 9 years) imposed with respect to the three offences under s. 61J(1) against SP were all concurrent (all commencing on 23 August 2012).
78That approach was adopted as the sexual assaults in each case were characterised as involving a sequence of sexual assaults on the one occasion against the same victim.  The Crown submitted that it would however, have been open to the sentencing judge to accumulate the sentences so as to reflect the total criminality.  In this respect it was observed in R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; (2002) 137 A Crim R 326 that sexual offences committed on the one night were partially accumulated.  See also R v Carlton [2008] NSWCCA 244; (2008) 189 A Crim R 332 at [122]-[123] per Price J.
79It is sufficient to observe here, as the above discussion illustrates, the discrete offences committed against both BH and SP were each serious and involved separate sexual assaults of different kinds.  Those facts could have justified an amount of accumulation of the sentences imposed in respect of BH and SP.  In this respect, I consider that the Applicant benefited from a degree of leniency in the approach that was taken by the sentencing judge in structuring the sentences.  As the Crown observed in its written submissions:
""86.  The effect of the total concurrency of the sentences and the backdating adopted by his Honour was to dilute the actual period to be served in custody for the discrete offences.""
80As earlier noted, the Applicant additionally had the benefit of backdating the sentences in respect of SP by a period of 2 years before the expiry of the non-parole periods imposed in respect of the offences against BH.
(b) Cases dealing with matters around the period 1996
81The written submissions for the Applicant set out the sentencing results in a number of cases.  The object of the sentencing comparison based on these cases was to demonstrate that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
82Set out below are relevant case summaries of the other cases upon which reliance was placed.
(i)In R v Russell (unreported NSWCCA, 21 June 1996) the court examined a range of cases involving aggravated sexual assault.  These included the cases decided in the years 1993 to 1994.  The court (Dunford J (with Gleeson CJ and Studdert J agreeing)) there observed:
""Although no two cases are the same, we have been referred to a number of other cases where the circumstances show some similarity to the present; particularly to R v Lewis (CCA, 14 December 1993, R v Logue (CCA, 31 March 1994), R v Burns (CCA, 21 September 1994), R v Baker (CCA, 2 August 1994). Those cases show a pattern of sentences ranging from minimum terms of six years to nine years and each followed a plea of guilty.""
The Crown in its written submissions on the sentence appeal submitted at [74] that the sentences imposed in relation to BH and SP were not inconsistent with the approach of the court in Russell, with the minimum terms correlating with the non-parole periods. I will return to this aspect below.
The decision in Russell was given in a Crown appeal and the court noted the element of double jeopardy was involved and, accordingly, on re-sentencing the court generally imposed sentences less than that which it otherwise considered may have been available to the sentencing judge. Against that background the court determined that the Respondent should be re-sentenced to a minimum term of 14 years with an additional term of 2 years.
(ii)In R v Boatswain (supra), the Applicant appealed against the severity of sentences. He was sentenced in respect of 12 crimes charged upon indictment. One series of offences included very serious sexual offences against two women on separate occasions. In the course of his decision Grove J stated (with Studdert and James JJ agreeing) that the offences, though they may not have been the worst imaginable, would in his Honour's view ""... fall into the category of the worst types of this offence"" and it was noted that the facts had indicated that each victim had been subjected to ""multiple outrage"". On each of the counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation the Applicant had been sentenced on the following basis:
(a)On each of the counts (against the first victim (Dr X)) a concurrent minimum term of 9 years with an additional term of 3 years was imposed.
(b)For each of four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation committed against the other victim (Mrs Y) concurrent minimum terms of 6 years cumulative upon the minimum term specified in relation to the offences against Dr X. An additional term of 8 years was specified.
Accordingly, the overall effect of the sentencing was to establish a total term of 23 years penal servitude divided into a minimum term of 15 years and an additional term of 8 years. The Court of Criminal Appeal reviewed a number of cases said to establish the then current sentencing pattern. However, the court concluded that it had not been established that the sentencing judge had erred in his approach or in his assessment or in the findings of fact made. Accordingly, this court declined to intervene.
(iii)In R v Presta (supra) the Appellant had been committed for sentence following pleas of guilty to 5 counts of kidnapping and 21 counts of aggravated sexual assault involving a number of victims over a period of time. He had been sentenced in respect of the kidnapping counts for fixed concurrent periods of 14 years penal servitude and, upon all of the aggravated sexual assault counts, to fixed terms of 14 years and 3 months with the exception of one count upon which the Appellant was sentenced to penal servitude for 19 years divided into a minimum term of 14 years and 3 months with an additional term of 4 years and 9 months.
Accordingly the effective sentencing order required the Appellant to serve a fixed or minimum period of 14 years and 3 months with an additional term of 4 years 9 months.
(iv)In R v Roberts (supra) the Appellant was tried and convicted by a jury of nine offences all involving acts of gross sexual indecency upon the complainant who was a 39 year old woman. In the course of his judgment Gleeson CJ (with whom Carruthers and Hunter JJ agreed) observed that the Appellant had a substantial criminal record including a conviction for the offence of threatening to inflict bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. He had been convicted of that offence in 1986 and was sentenced to penal servitude for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
So far as the particular offences were concerned the objective seriousness of them was described as ""extreme"". The sentencing judge had sentenced the Appellant to a sentence that had the total effect of imposing on him penal servitude for 13 years made up of a minimum term of 11 years and an additional term of 2 years. In that respect the sentencing judge accumulated the sentences imposed in respect of the charge involving an act of indecency on Count1. On the remaining sentences that were imposed in respect of the charges of sexual intercourse without consent, the sentences imposed were concurrent.
The argument in that case was addressed not so much to the individual sentences but as to the total effect of the sentences. It was argued that the consequence of the accumulation was to produce a result which was manifestly excessive.
Gleeson CJ in that respect stated:
""In my view, having regard to the extraordinary serious objective circumstances of the case, and the appellant's previous record, a head sentence of thirteen years for all of these offences was well within the range of a proper sentencing discretion. It is to be noted in this respect that the legislature has, in fairly recent years, doubled the maximum penalty for crimes of this nature and it is appropriate for the courts to respond to that.""
(v)In R v AEM & ORS [2002] NSWCCA 58, the offender AEM had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The offender KEM was sentenced to 5 years 7 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months whilst the offender MM was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
On a Crown appeal AEM's sentence was increased to a total sentence of 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years, KEM's sentence was increased to 14 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and MM's sentence was increased to 13 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.
The offences committed in that case were against two 16 year old females. They were forcibly detained for a period of 4 hours and subjected to serious sexual assaults.  In the commission of the offences AEM produced a knife. The knife was also used against one of the two victims detained in another room. The multiple sexual assaults were extremely serious offences.
In the Additional Crown Submissions it was noted that all the sentences imposed in AEM & ORS were after a Crown appeal on sentence and subject to double jeopardy. Two of the offenders were juveniles. This is said to make comparison with the Applicant difficult. It was also submitted by the Crown that the criminality was significantly less than that of the Applicant and yet the total effective sentences were not significantly less than the total sentence imposed by the District Court in respect of the offences, the subject of the present case for BH and SP.
(vi)In R v Bilal Skaf (supra) the Applicant had been charged with two counts with detain for advantage, nine counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (in company) and two counts of assault. He was found guilty on all counts.
There had been two trials. The first trial concerned criminal activity on 10 August 2000. The second trial concerned criminal activity on 30 August 2000.
In respect of the criminal activity on 10 August the Applicant was charged with offences against Ms A and separately in respect of offences against Ms B.
The court extracted the following well-known observations in Veen v R [No.2] (supra) at 472-473 Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ observed:
""The principle of proportionality is now firmly established in this country. It was the unanimous view of the court in Veen [No. 1] that a sentence should not be increased beyond what is proportionate to the crime in order merely to extend the period of protection of society from the risk of recidivism on the part of the offender: Veen v R (1979) 143 CLR 458 at 468, 482-483 and 495.
...
It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence.  The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventative detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible."" 
In re-sentencing for the offences of 10 August 2010 this court followed the approach of the sentencing judge giving the Applicant the benefit of concurrent sentences for the unlawful detention counts and for the assault counts.
In respect of the offences against Ms A in which the Applicant offended as a principal in the first degree, the court, on re-sentencing, imposed a term of imprisonment of 15 years. Accordingly for the offences of aggravated sexual assault without consent (counts 3 and 5 involving Ms A) on each count the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months.
In respect of the offence against Ms B, in which the Applicant offended as a principal in the first degree, the court considered that a sentence of 15 years should be imposed such sentence to commence 2 years after the commencement date for the offences against Ms A. Accordingly, in respect of the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in company (Count 14) involving Ms B, the Applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment 15 years with a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months.
83At the hearing of the present application on 8 July 2011 the presiding judge requested the parties to provide further assistance ""in relation to the appropriate range of sentencing"" with respect to the ""manifestly excessive"" ground of appeal.
84Supplementary submissions were provided on behalf of the Applicant and the Court also received Additional Crown Submissions on Sentence Appeal dated 12 July 2011.
85In the supplementary submissions for the Applicant, a number of decisions of this Court were referred to and summarised. These included:
R v Russell (supra), R v Burns (supra), R v Lewis (supra), R v Logue (unreported NSWCCA 31 March 1994) and R v Baker (supra).
86It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that these cases demonstrated a range of penalties as at 1996, which were significantly more lenient than those the subject of the present case. The Applicant also relied upon the cases summarised in its earlier written submissions.
87The Crown's summary in relation to R v Burns is set out at pp 17-19 of the Additional Crown Submissions on the Sentence Appeal.
88An examination of the relevant cases establishing the sentencing pattern in 1996 demonstrate, as the Crown observed, and consistently with what this court said in Russell that sentences involving minimal terms or non-parole periods of between figures 6 years and 6 months to 9 years are within range for offences under s. 61(J) although individual cases may fall below or above that range.
89Having regard to cases which reference was made in submissions and constituting the relevant sentencing pattern I accept the Crown's submission that the sentences for the offences against BH were well within the range.
90In relation to SP, the sentencing in respect of the serious offences in Burns provides guidance in evaluating the sentences imposed.  I accept the Crown's submission that an examination of the relevant facts and circumstances of both cases establishes that the criminality of the Applicant in respect of the offences committed by him against SP is of a higher order than in Burns.  Matters of significance in the comparison include the age of SP (15 years of age) and the fact that no weapon was used in Burns.
91An evaluation of the relevant sentencing patterns supports the conclusion that the sentences imposed on the Applicant in respect of BH and SP cannot be considered either as excessive or manifestly excessive. 
92As the discussion above makes clear, the Remarks on Sentence were comprehensive.  They, in particular, contained a detailed analysis of the facts concerning the aggravated sexual assaults against BH and SP.  The remarks also addressed, in detail, the Applicant's criminal history and the facts in relation to his offending for which he was sentenced by Tupman DCJ and Holt DCJ.  The sentencing judge additionally considered the Applicant's ""personal circumstances"", including the matters that were considered and discussed by Dr Furst, forensic psychiatrist.  Finally, additional matters considered included ""remorse and contrition"", rehabilitation and the risk of re-offending before his Honour set out matters relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion under the heading ""Sentencing Consideration"".  
93In determining the sentences to be imposed, the sentencing judge specifically considered the question of delay between the commission of the offences and sentence.
94In relation to the sentences against BH, the sentencing judge noted:
(1)That at the time of the commission of the offences, the offender had no relevant criminal history.  They were first in time of the four episodes of offending behaviour in relation to the four victims.
(2)The offender was to be sentenced on the basis of his criminal record as it was at the time of the commission of the offences.  The later aggravated sexual assaults could not be considered as an aggravating feature.
(3)The subsequent offences, however, would operate to deny the Applicant the leniency that he would be entitled to if the offences against BH represented one-off offences of sexual assault. Clearly the offences were not isolated and they were relevant in assessing the offender's prospects of rehabilitation and to considering issues involving risk to the community. (Remarks on Sentence at p.38-39) 
95In sentencing the Applicant for the offences against SP, in relation to offences 5, 6 and 7 - aggravated sexual assault - the sentencing judge expressly had regard to the following matters:
(1)That the offences were committed subsequent to previous offences of aggravated sexual assault.
(2)The sentences to be imposed in respect of the offences in question had to be appropriate to them and only to them.  In other words, as noted above in relation to Ground 1, there had to be no element of double punishment for the past offences.
(3)That, as also discussed in relation to Ground 1, his Honour stated that it was relevant to take into account, when sentencing for the offences under s. 61J(1), the fact that the Applicant's past criminal conduct included similar offences.
96The Crown noted that none of the cases referred to in the submissions are truly comparable to what the Applicant did in the present case in all the circumstances in what was described by the Crown as ""... depraved and humiliating attacks on four young women, when his total criminality is assessed."" Additional Crown Submissions on Sentence Appeal at [11]
97The analysis in the Additional Crown Submissions on Sentence Appeal constitutes a comprehensive analysis of sentencing decisions.  Based on an examination of those decisions I have concluded as follows: 
(i)The cases are consistent with the observations made in Russell (supra) namely, that sentences involving minimum terms (non-parole periods between 6 years and 6 months to 9 years) were within range for offences of this kind.  However that is not to say that sentences in particular cases could not be more or less.
(ii)The sentence for the offences against BH were within the range indicated by the cases referred to in the submissions despite the criminality of the Applicant being greater that in some of those cases and the overall seriousness of his offences being greater.
(iii)The sentence imposed in R v Burns (supra) was identical to that in SP.  It was submitted that the criminality of the offence on SP was greater than that of the offender Burns, as was the Applicant's prior history.  I accept the submission.  Although Burns involved a breach of a bond, that could not balance out the other factors.
(iv)The analysis of the abovementioned cases does not demonstrate that the sentences imposed by the District Court on the Applicant in the present case were manifestly excessive.
(c)  The principal of totality
98Consideration then arises as to whether or not the sentencing judge failed to properly apply the principle of totality.  That issue is to be considered in light of the sentences imposed by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ and with regard to the extent of the concurrence (2 years) of the sentences imposed in respect of SP upon the sentences imposed in respect of BH.
99In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41, at [27], Howie J, with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed, said:
""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively.  The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality:  can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence?  If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences.  If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences.  This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.  Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other...""
100The application of the principle of totality in cases of separate offences involving significant criminality, was explained by this court in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 326 at [13] where Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ stated:
""In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending...  This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion... The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault:  R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326.  Although it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that the sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality.""
101In determining the sentences to be imposed with respect to the Applicant's multiple offending in respect of BH and SP, the sentencing judge was required to take into account the following matters:
(1)The need for the individual sentences to reflect the gravity of each offence viewed objectively: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 per Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J.
(2)The need for appropriate weight to be given to give effect to the purposes of punishment as set out in s. 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  In particular there was a need to ensure that the Applicant was adequately punished so as to denounce his conduct and to recognise the severe and extensive harm done to the victims.
(3)The need to consider how the sentences in respect of the offences were to be structured in light of the sentences imposed by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ.
(4)The need to ensure that, when sentencing for multiple offences, there were different victims.
(5)The Applicant was already serving sentences for other offences and the aggregation of all of the sentences constitute a ""just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved:"" Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307-308; (1997) 94 A Crim R 397 at 406 per McHugh J.
102In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [16] this Court observed that the severity of the sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship.  In other words severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence: R v MAK, supra, at [16].  The Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) there quoted the following passage in the judgment of Malcolm CJ in Clinch v The Queen (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306:
""... [T]he severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of the sentence.  Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year.  Similarly, while a sentence of 7 years may be appropriate for one set of offences, a sentence of 8 years may be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation.  Where both sets are committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences.""
103The other matter to be considered under the totality principle, also referred to by this court in MAK, (supra), is the fact that an extremely long total sentence may be ""crushing"" upon an offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release.  It was observed in MAK at [17]-[18]:
""... This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform.  Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.
A sentencing court must, however, take care when applying the totality principle.  Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim 252 at [112]. For similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no or little penalty is imposed for the additional offences.""
104Turning to the present case I make the following observations:
(1)The Applicant's offending under s. 61J(1) of the Crimes Act on 1 May 1996 in respect of JL, involving threats with a pistol, and his further offending under s. 61J(1) in respect of LE, involving threats with a knife, were extremely serious offences.
(2)Similarly, the Applicant's offences under s. 61J(1) in respect of the victim JL, also involving threats of actual bodily harm involving the use of a pistol, were at least equally serious offences to those against LE.
(3)The multiple offending of the Applicant (three offences under s. 61J(1) against the victim BH) involving threats with the use of a knife of actual bodily harm were also at least equally serious offences as those referred to above.  In combination, all of the abovementioned offences involved total criminality of an extremely high order.
(4)The imposition of three concurrent sentences in respect of the offences under s.61J(1) against BH, each involving fixed terms of 6 years and 9 months from 23 November 2007 to 22 August 2014 involved an exercise of the sentencing discretion which operated, to a significant extent, in favour of the Applicant.
(5)The three offences against SP committed by the Applicant under s.61J(1), each involving the use of a knife and threats of actual bodily harm, involved criminality of an even higher order than the previous offences referred to above.  The sentences in respect of each offence under s.61J(1), namely terms of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 9 years to date from 23 August 2012 to 22 August 2021 with a balance of term of 3 years to expire on 22 August 2024 were all concurrent with each other.  Again, as earlier noted, this represented an exercise of the sentencing discretion which operated, to a significant extent, in favour of the Applicant.
Decision
105A review of the sentencing decisions referred to above, in my assessment, establishes that the terms of the sentences imposed in respect of BH were consistent with the sentencing pattern for similar offences in the period 1995/1996.
106In respect of the offences committed against SP, by reason of the particular facts associated with the offending and taking into account the victim's age (15 years), the sentences imposed in respect of such offending were also consistent with the range of sentencing in the relevant period and in particular were consistent with the sentence imposed in R v Burns, (supra).
107There remains for consideration the issue of totality in the circumstances:
(a)Where at the time of the sentencing for the offences against BH and SP the Applicant had been sentenced by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ as discussed above; and
(b)The Applicant was to be sentenced for a number of serious offences, in particular those under s 61J(1) against two victims, one of whom was under the age of 16 years.
108In relation to the aggregation of sentences, as the Crown noted at [10] of its written submissions on the sentence appeal the total effective sentence for all 4 victims when combined forms a total sentence of 27 years and 9 months to date from 25 November 1996 to 22 August 2024 and the total effective non-parole period of 24 years and 9 months from 25 November 1996 to 22 August 2021 with a balance of 3 years to date from 23 August 2021 to 22 August 2024.
109In the submissions on behalf of the Applicant, it was noted that the ratio of the total effective non-parole period of 24 years and 9 months to the total effective sentence of 27 years and 9 months is 89%.  The submission was that that ratio indicated the total effective sentence was manifestly excessive.
110I record the following observations in relation to the structure of the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in this case:
(i)The first sentence in time imposed by the sentencing judge commenced 23 May 2007 on which date the non-parole period imposed by Tupman DCJ was due to expire.  In other words, there was no concurrence provided for in relation to that sentence and the sentence in respect of the offence under s 97(1), robbery with an offensive weapon, involving a fixed term of 18 months.
(ii)The sentences imposed under s 61J(1) on the Applicant in respect of the three offences against BH were each for fixed terms of 6 years and 9 months to commence on 23 November 2007 (that is 6 months after the commencement of the sentence referred to in (i) above and to expire on 22 August 2014).  
(iii)The sentences imposed under s 61J(1) in respect of the three offences by the Applicant against SP were made concurrent by two years on the fixed term of 6 years and 9 months in respect of BH.  In that respect, the three concurrent sentences in respect of SP commenced on 23 August 2012 involving a non-parole period of 9 years to date from that date and to expire on 22 August 2021.  
111On consideration of the facts and circumstances of the subject offences and the sentences imposed in relation to them, I have concluded that whilst the individual sentences were not manifestly excessive, there was a need for greater concurrency in relation to the sentences than that for which provision was made by the sentencing Judge for the following reasons:
(i)The sentence imposed in respect of the offence of robbery with an offensive weapon on BH was entirely cumulative upon the substantial sentence imposed by Tupman DCJ which expired on 23 May 2007.
(ii)Whilst the extent of concurrence in relation to the sentences in respect of offences 1, 2 and 3 upon offence 4 (BH) referred to in paragraph 110(ii) above, namely 6 months was appropriate, the sentences imposed with respect to offences 5, 6 and 7 against SP were only made concurrent by 2 years on the offences imposed with respect to BH (offences 1, 2 & 3) to commence on 23 August 2012.
(iii)Given the fact that the total effective sentence in relation to the subject offences against BH and SP amounted to 17 years and 3 months with a total effective non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months there was a need for greater concurrence in relation to the sentences imposed both because of the total effective period of imprisonment imposed under the terms of those sentences and as well, the period of imprisonment imposed by the sentences for which the Applicant had already been sentenced (respectively on 14 November 1997 by Holt DCJ and on 8 November 2002 by Tupman DCJ.
(iv)An increase in the concurrence of sentences ameliorates, to a point, the risk or prospect of a ""crushing"" sentence in the sense discussed above.
Concurrency of Sentences
112As I have indicated above the sentencing Judge sought to give effect to the principle of totality by allowing for a measure of concurrence in the sentences imposed, including in particular the sentences imposed with respect to the offences against BH and SP.  The issue arising in relation to Ground 2 is the sufficiency of the concurrence of sentences overall.  
113In respect of BH as earlier noted the sentences in respect of offences 1, 2 and 3 were concurrent by 6 months on the sentence imposed with respect to offence 4.  There is no basis for challenging the adequacy of the extent of concurrence in that respect.  
114In respect of SP, as noted above, the sentences in respect of 5, 6 and 7 were made concurrent by a period of 2 years on the sentences imposed in respect of the offences 1, 2 and 3 concerning BH. 
115Accordingly the total concurrence of sentences determined by the sentencing Judge amounted to a total period of 2 years 6 months. 
116In assessing the adequacy of the same it is necessary to evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and having done so, to determine what downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences:  R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245, 260. 
117In the evaluation of totality, relevant considerations include the fact that the multiple sexual offences by the Applicant involved two victims, that the group of offences against each victim occurred on two separate occasions and the fact that each of the offences fell within the more serious band of the range of criminality involved therein.  Additionally it is also necessary to take into account that each of the sentences under s 61J(1) carried maximum penalties of 20 years imprisonment. 
118In my assessment, taking into account all of the relevant factors, I consider that a greater level of concurrence should have been provided for in respect of the sentences against SP so far as offences 5, 6 and 7 are concerned.  In that respect I have concluded that those sentences should have been made concurrent by a total period of 4 years on the sentences imposed in respect of offences 1, 2 and 3 committed against BH.  In re sentencing the applicant to make provision for the additional concurrence in that respect, the sentences imposed in respect of counts 5, 6 and 7 against SP should be adjusted to commence on 23 February 2011 in lieu of the commencement dates of 23 August 2012 imposed by the sentencing Judge.  That alteration will give effect to the additional concurrence to which I have referred above. 
119In summary I have concluded that the only basis for this Court's intervention is the need to adjust the concurrence of the abovementioned sentences to give effect to the principle of totality having regard to (a) the terms of the sentences imposed by the sentencing Judge (b) the sentences that had been previously imposed on the applicant by Holt DCJ and Tupman DCJ. The total extent of concurrence of sentences as determined by the sentencing judge namely, 2 years and 6 months should be adjusted by a further period of 1 year 6 months, thereby making the total concurrence of sentences, as referred to in paragraph 118 above, of 4 years.
120Accordingly in re sentencing the Applicant, the terms of the sentences to be imposed by this Court will be the terms specified by King DCJ except that the specified commencement dates of the sentences in respect of offences 5, 6 and 7 will be altered in order to give effect to the abovementioned increase in the extent of the concurrence of sentences. 
121I accordingly propose that the sentences imposed by the District Court in respect of Counts 5, 6 and 7 be set aside and the applicant be re sentenced as follows: 
(i)Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the District Court on 5 February 2010 be granted.
(ii)The appeal upheld in part.
(iii)In respect of Count 5 - the offence of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 the applicant be sentenced to a non parole period of 9 years to commence on 23 February 2011 and to expire on 22 February 2020 with a parole period of 3 years to expire on 22 February 2023. 
(iv)In respect of Count 6 - the offence pursuant to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 the applicant be sentenced to a non parole period of 9 years to commence on 23 February 2011 and to expire on 22 February 2020 with a parole period of 3 years to expire on 22 February 2023.
(v)In respect of Count 7 - the offence pursuant to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 the applicant be sentenced to a non parole period of 9 years to commence on 23 February 2011 and to expire on 22 February 2020 with a parole period of 3 years to expire on 22 February 2023.
122The total effective non parole period in respect of offences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 will accordingly be a period of 12 years 9 months and a balance of 3 years to date from 23 February 2023.
123Accordingly the first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole will be 22 February 2020.  
124HARRISON J:  I agree with Hall J.
125THE COURT:  Since delivery of this judgment the Court's attention has been drawn to a typographical error in respect of Order (v) whereby the commencement date for the non parole period was stated to commence on 22 February 2011, whereas it should have read 23 February 2011. This error appeared in paragraph 121(v) of the judgment.
126The Court accordingly made an Order varying Order (v) under the 'slip' rule so that the non-parole period stated in Order (v) is to commence on 23 February 2011.
127Additional amendments have been made to the text of the judgment.  In the course of the amendments, the date referred to in paragraph 122, 22 February 2023, has been amended to 23 February 2023, to accord with order (v).

2707895,R v Harpreet Singh [2012] NSWSC 869,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The accused applies for an order discharging the jury. That application arises in the following way.

2At the commencement of the trial the accused opened the defence case to the jury. That opening was in part predicated upon an anticipation that evidence would be led in the Crown case from a series of witnesses that would include evidence about events at the apartment of Gurpreet Singh and Harpreet Kaur Bhullar on the evening of 28 December 2009 and the following early morning. Apart from those two people, only the accused, the deceased and two other people were present. The other two were Sukhjit Kaur and Baljinder Singh. Each of these two gave evidence at the committal hearing.

3Baljinder Singh gave evidence in this trial commencing on 18 July 2012. His evidence had not concluded at the end of the day and he was therefore due and expected to return to the witness box the following day. In the meantime, both he and Sukhjit Kaur approached the police in charge of the investigation after court hours indicating that they both wished to change their evidence in certain respects. Significant among these respects was their evidence concerning the timing of the deceased's departure from the apartment. Each witness originally indicated in statements given to police that the deceased had left the apartment before them. In anticipation of giving their revised evidence, each witness indicated that the deceased was still in the second bedroom of the apartment when they left. The Crown informed me of this on the ninth day of the trial on 19 July 2012 in the following passage:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I was informed overnight that after the close of business yesterday, the present witness Baljinder Singh approached the officer-in-charge, Detective Clark, as a result of which Baljinder Singh and his wife Sukjit Kaur gave statements overnight to the police. Those statements change - are different from what is contained in their original witness statements in significant respects and as between the two of them, in some different respects. But the position we now have is that we have fresh statements and we have inconsistent statements from them about the events of the night, some of which impact on matters of significance in the trial.

The principal one being that after Ranjodh Singh went to the second bedroom, on Baljinder Singh's new version, being pushed by Harpreet Singh, then on his version there was some involvement of Ranjodh Singh, but after he went to the bedroom, he never left the bedroom. He remained in the unit, in the bedroom, until he and his wife left. 

4On the previous day of the trial, and before all this had occurred, Mr King of counsel for the accused had cross examined Harpreet Kaur Bhullar, and put to her a proposition based upon his understandable expectation that Baljinder Singh and Sukhjit Kaur would later give evidence in accordance with their evidence at the committal and without knowing that they would later seek to change their stories. In that setting, he asked Ms Bhullar the following series of questions at T 492:

""Q. Harpreet Singh went to bed?
A. INTERPRETER: He went into his room. I didn't see him going in the bed.

Q. On your version, Ranjodh is still in the room?
A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. The last time you saw him he was unconscious?
A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. Slumped on the floor? Before dinner?
A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. Before you went to bed didn't you go and brush your teeth or go to the toilet or something like that?
A. INTERPRETER: I don't remember.

Q. You didn't think to peek in the second room to see if Ranjodh was still lying there?
A. INTERPRETER: No.

Q. You weren't tempted to see if your friend was still alive?

INTERPRETER: Say it again, please?

KING

Q. You weren't tempted to go and have a look to see if your friend was still alive?
A. INTERPRETER: No.

Q. No, and I suggest you weren't tempted to go and have a look in that bedroom because you well knew that he wasn't there?
A. INTERPRETER: Why not? He was still there.

Q. All right and I suggest the story you've told the jury about a fight in the bedroom is a lie?
A. INTERPRETER: No.

Q. To cover up what really happened later on?
A. INTERPRETER: No.""

5Baljinder Singh and Sukhjit Kaur subsequently each gave evidence, first in a Basha type inquiry before in the absence of the jury and later in the trial proper. They confirmed that the deceased was still in the bedroom by the time that they left the apartment. The effect of all of this is that, whatever one might wish to say about the differing, not to say contradictory, versions given by the four other witnesses of what occurred at the apartment, all of them in one form or another ultimately proffered a version that placed the deceased in the second bedroom of the apartment until at least the time when Baljinder Singh and Sukhjit Kaur left the premises.

6It was in these circumstances that Mr King sought to discharge the jury upon the basis that his earlier cross examination of Harpreet Kaur Bhullar in which he had suggested that the deceased was no longer at the apartment, may have caused irreparable prejudice to the accused and that there was a potential for the trial to miscarry as a result. He was concerned that the jury would be left with the impression that that cross examination was based upon the accused's instructions and that the accused was propounding a version that the deceased was no longer in the apartment, in contrast to the now emerging unanimous versions from the other four witnesses that the deceased was still there at the time in question. At the very least, Mr King was concerned that the accused might appear to be giving unreliable instructions to his counsel and that this had, or may have, become apparent to the jury, in the circumstances that I have outlined.

7I rejected the application and indicated that I would give reasons in due course. 

8More or less throughout this trial, for better or worse, much time and effort has been concentrated upon what is alleged to have transpired at the apartment. It is the setting from which the fateful journey to the scene of the deceased's death commenced. It is the setting that on one view fomented the precipitating series of causes and influences that culminated in the death. What is clear is that there is simply no clear picture of what really happened. By the time that Baljinder Singh and Sujhjit Kaur had given their evidence, which included their markedly changed story concerning the location of the deceased in the bedroom when they all sat down to dinner and thereafter, the task of discerning who if anyone could be believed had only become more difficult for the jury. This in the overall scheme of things could in my view only have been significantly advantageous for the accused and not otherwise. I could discern no prejudice to the accused arising from this.

9More importantly, the approach otherwise consistently taken by the accused in cross examination of witnesses, and revealed in evidence that is not the subject of relevant doubt, was that the deceased had been driven from the apartment by the accused and Gurpreet Singh and Harpreet Kaur Bhullar after Baljinder Singh and Sukhjit Kaur had left. That evidence seems to me overwhelmingly to have swamped any flicker of doubt or concern that Mr King suggests the jury might have had following from his cross examination, in particular the italicised question, of Harpreet Kaur Bhullar. It would be very surprising to me if the jury had even noticed the slight tension between the two positions that Mr King refers to in the overall scheme of the detailed evidence touching and concerning the events at the apartment that evening.

10I did not consider that there were proper grounds for the discharge of the jury in these circumstances.

2707914,Andrews v Ardler [2012] NSWSC 845,"Judgment

Introduction

1By summons of 22 December 2011, the plaintiff sought the following relief: 

""1. An order pursuant to s. 58(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 granting leave to appeal from the pre-trial order of Dr G.C. Fleming, Magistrate, given at the Nowra Local Court on 12 December 2011;

2. An order pursuant to s. 51(6) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 that these proceedings be removed into the Court of Appeal;

3. An order pursuant to s 59(2)(a) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the pre-trial order; or in the alternative:

4. A declaration that pursuant to s. 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 that [sic] Dr G.C. Fleming, Magistrate erred in law in ruling that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact (the fact being the existence of native title) is a defence available to the defendants at law where the defendants seek to be exonerated from any criminal liability for alleged breaches of ss 14(2), 16(1) and 18(2) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994, based upon s 211 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).

5. An order that the matters be remitted to the Magistrate to be dealt with according to law.""

Background

2The defendants are two Aboriginal men. By way of six Court Attendance Notices all dated 22 June 2010, they are each charged with three criminal offences against the Fisheries Management Act 1994 (""the Act""). The offence creating provisions are s 14(2), s 16(1) and s 18(2).

3In short, the defendants are accused of committing fishing offences at Jervis Bay, NSW. The plaintiff is the prosecutor in the proceedings. 

4The matters were listed for hearing in Nowra Local Court on 12 December 2011 before Magistrate G C Fleming. Before that date, there had been some contact between the legal representatives of the parties. Counsel for the defendants (who also appeared for them in this Court) had indicated that the defendants would be relying on native title in the proceedings. As a result of that, senior counsel for the prosecution (who also appeared in this Court) prepared a document seeking a number of rulings as to matters of law that could arise in the hearing. That was done purportedly pursuant to s 139 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. I will return to the correctness of that procedure later in this judgment. That document sought to have the Magistrate answer five questions of law and procedure (and one question as to the way forward once those questions were answered). 

5Of indirect relevance to these proceedings are Questions One and Two. They were as follows:

""Question 1.

Is s. 211 of the NTA capable of applying to s. 16 of the FMA?

Question 2. 

Does the prosecutor or the accused bear first the legal and second the evidentiary onus of establishing that s. 211 of the NTA applies, and to what evidential standard?""

In answering those questions, to state the position very succinctly, her Honour stated that she considered that s 211 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) could apply to the offences under consideration, thereby relieving the defendants of any criminal liability. Furthermore, her Honour was of the view that it was incumbent upon the defendants to establish on the balance of probabilities that native title did so operate.

6Of direct relevance to these proceedings is Question Four:

""In this trial, is the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact a defense [sic] available at law and if so, what must be shown, by which party, and to what standard?""

7On the same day, the Magistrate answered that question. Because what was said on that day with regard to Question Four is reasonably short, I will set it out in its totality:

""I am going to move to question 4 and I will come back. Question 4 is whether or not the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available and two subsidiary questions: what must be show[n] by what party and to what standard. I have heard the submissions. I am very familiar with the authority of Proudman v Dayman. I have also had a look at the Act and the relevant offence provisions. I am not satisfied there is any reason why an honest and reasonable mistake of fact defence should not be available. There is nothing in the submissions that have been put to me that would convince me that it is not available.

I accept that there are some difficulties logistically, in terms of the way that defence and the natural course of the evidence will flow. I do not accept that the duality of the Commonwealth and State provisions, in any way, undermines the availability of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. I am alerted to the difficulties that are put to me by the prosecution as to how that particularly should apply. At the end of the day, the onus is going to be on the defendant to prove that defence. That will be [a] matter of the evidence. It will be a matter of addressing matters that do come in the course of the evidence and then can be tested in the evidence. I do not believe that it requires that there be any greater particularity, as a matter of notice, that needs to be provided in relation to that defence. I accept - Mr Waters has put to me - that it is a matter that has been determined on the facts of each case, as the evidence falls, and as the evidence is tested."" (emphasis added)

8After the five questions were answered, the parties sought time to consider their positions. The following day, 13 December 2011, counsel for the plaintiff said:

""The position is this, your Honour as foreshadowed yesterday, the prosecution is seeking to review one or more of the adverse answers. It may be, depending on legal aid funding, the defendant does the same in relation to its interests. On my instructions, we'll bring those proceedings in the Supreme Court, I expect, this week. We'll seek to have them dealt with expeditiously there. Our joint application therefore now is for this matter to be adjourned for mention, say, in March, with liberty to apply. So if, for example, if we find out that the matter's going to be listed for hearing in the Supreme Court on such and such a date we can let the Court know. If you require us to attend for the mention we can, otherwise it may be possible to further adjourn it. Then, just through the shopping list of other things, your Honour, before we perhaps fix on a date- -"" (emphasis added).

9Her Honour was not adverse to that application, but also wished to supplement what her Honour had said the day before on the topics raised by Question Four. Again, what her Honour said was not lengthy, and I will set it out in its entirety:

""If I can just briefly return to question 4 where I gave brief reasons yesterday. I just want that put a little bit more clarity around those reasons. As I said, I understand and I accept, that this will not change the position we are in today. The question was, in the trial, whether the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available at law; and, if so, what must be shown by which party and to what standard.

In considering that question yesterday, as to the first part, whether the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is a defence available at law; my answer was, yes, it was. I was referred obviously to the leading authority of Proudman v Dayman, also to the matter of Dowling v Bowie, that were with the materials that were provided to me. I am familiar with and read those authorities and I found that it was applicable, and in my view, as a general rule, it is applicable. The question is whether it is excluded; and I was directed to, in submissions, matters in those decisions[.]

It can of course be excluded by words, context, subject matter, or by the general nature of the proceedings for the particular offence. I am not satisfied that for these particular offences it is excluded, nor that they are offences ultimately of strict liability turning only on the proof of the matters that were related to in submissions.

As to the mistake of fact, the question was if so, what must be shown. It was put to me by the defendant that mistake of fact would of course be, in this particular circumstance, a mistaken belief in native title rights. The question is what would need to be shown by which party, exactly what facts will need to be shown will depend upon the exact nature of the native title claim, what each defendant asserts to have believed to found the mistake. It may be that some facts would not be in dispute, Aboriginality for example. It may be that other facts in relation to the proof of native title such as connection to land, traditional use and custom, may indeed in each individual case be the facts to which the honest and reasonable mistake attaches.

In terms of the onus; the onus is on the defendant, in my view, to establish on the balance of probabilities the honest and reasonable belief. That is an evidentiary onus. Having proved that on the balance of probabilities it will be a legal onus that shifts to the prosecution to negative, these being criminal proceedings, to the standard beyond reasonable doubt."" (emphasis added)

10The matter was then adjourned, and the summons that founds these proceedings was issued shortly thereafter. 

11It is noteworthy that neither party referred her Honour to Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30; (2004) 218 CLR 493. I infer that that occurred because Question Four did not ask anything about the distinction between mistake of fact and mistake of law with respect to criminal liability.

Position of the plaintiff

12This summary seeks to cover the submissions of the plaintiff in the summons, the written submissions in this Court, and the oral submissions made by senior counsel.

13With regard to Prayer 2, that was not pressed. 

14With regard to Prayers 1 and 3, although they were not abandoned, senior counsel for the plaintiff did not seek to make any oral submissions in support of them. I inferred from the adoption of that course that the plaintiff accepted the written submissions of the defendants, to the effect that there were no orders, interlocutory or otherwise, that were amenable to an appeal pursuant to s 58 and s 59 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.

15However, senior counsel for the plaintiff pressed Prayer 4, and sought the declaration contained therein. He submitted that the rulings of the Magistrate revealed an error of law. He focussed in particular on the sentence in the first passage that I have extracted in which the Magistrate said ""I do not accept that the duality of the Commonwealth and State provisions, in any way, undermines the availability of an honest and reasonable mistake of fact."" 

16In the second passage extracted above, senior counsel for the plaintiff drew attention to the following: ""[i]t was put to me by the defendant that mistake of fact would of course be, in this particular circumstance, a mistaken belief in native title rights"". He submitted that the rest of that paragraph demonstrated an erroneous conflation of concepts of mistake of fact and mistake of law. 

17Senior counsel for the plaintiff explicitly conceded in this Court that the offences pursuant to which the defendants had been brought to the Local Court were strict liability offences, and therefore the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact was available. He did so whilst aware that there are statutory defences that exist in the Act attaching to the offences, they being true defences that cast the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities on a defendant, pursuant to s 141 of the Evidence Act 1995. Examples of such statutory defences are contained in s 14(3) and s 21 of the Act. But his contention was that the ruling of the Magistrate was erroneous as to how that ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact would operate, and what its content would be. In particular, he submitted that it could not be correct that the subject of the honest and reasonable mistake of fact could be whether or not native title existed.

18In support of that, he accepted that s 211 of the Native Title Act operates to suspend (to use the words of the High Court in Western Australia v The Commonwealth (Native Title Act Case) [1995] HCA 47; (1995) 183 CLR 373 at p 474) the operation of the offence creating provisions in the Act. In other words, senior counsel accepted, for the purposes of these proceedings, the correctness of the answer of her Honour to Questions One and Two. But he submitted that, if it had been the intention of either the State or Federal Parliament that the existence of native title could form the basis of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, then one or other of the Parliaments would have explicitly said so in one or other of the statutes.

19Secondly, he submitted that it is anomalous for a defendant to bear the onus of satisfying the Magistrate that native title suspends the operation of the offence creating provisions on the balance of probabilities, and yet an honest and reasonable mistake on the part of the defendants about native title would need to be disproven beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.

20Thirdly, senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that a mistake as to the existence of native title is one of law, not fact. 

21Fourthly, he submitted that, in reading the rulings of the Magistrate, it would be artificial not to have regard to the discussion that preceded it. Properly construed and in context, he submitted, the two passages demonstrated error of law. 

22Senior counsel accepted that the making of a declaration by this Court about matters of law in criminal proceedings would be quite exceptional, and that the Courts have long warned against the fragmentation of such proceedings. In that regard, he referred to Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; (1978) 142 CLR 1 and Rozenes v Beljajev (1994) 126 ALR 481. But he pointed to the fact that this summary hearing was unusual in its issues, that the Magistrate had agreed to provide advance rulings, that the proposed evidence in the defence cases seemingly would be very lengthy, that the proceedings had already been fragmented and delayed, and that there had been a joint application for an adjournment. He submitted that the high hurdle had been cleared. 

Position of the defendants

23Turning first to consideration of the answers to Questions One and Two, counsel for the defendants did not bind himself as to acceptance of their correctness before the Magistrate in future. However, they have not been the subject of proceedings on his part, and he was content for me to proceed on the assumption that the answers are correct.

24Counsel for the defendants submitted that there had been no order made in the Local Court, merely rulings, or perhaps indications of how the Magistrate may approach the matter. He referred to the well-known case of Salter v Director of Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCA 357; (2009) 75 NSWLR 392 which demonstrates that, in proceedings such as these under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, it is always necessary to identify with precision an order at first instance that is amenable to appeal. He submitted that he would not feel constrained from asking the Magistrate to revisit the questions dealt with by her Honour, and that senior counsel for the plaintiff could revisit the question, at the latest, if and when counsel for the defendants tendered evidence that senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted was not relevant to the ""defence"", and therefore inadmissible.

25Counsel for the defendants submitted that the honest and reasonable mistake could pertain to native title, or, at the least, to the factual matters underpinning it. He emphasised that native title is established by way of evidence of facts. 

26He emphasised that no evidence whatsoever had been led or tendered in the hearing, so that the rulings of the Magistrate in the proceedings in this Court were prospective, and to a very large degree hypothetical. The exception to that proposition was that a notice pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act was tendered before her Honour, although seemingly not marked as an exhibit. In that document, most if not all of the elements of the offences were conceded. But nothing had been led about native title, or about the states of mind of the defendants that could found the ""defence"".

27Counsel for the defendants submitted that I should exercise my discretion not to grant the declaration, even if I discerned error of law, and that I should let the summary hearing proceed in the usual way.

Decision

Legal background

28Because it does seem to me that there was, with respect, a little confusion in the Local Court about honest and reasonable mistake of fact and its operation, it may be appropriate if I set out some of the legal background. A useful summary of the ""defence"" is to be found in Chapter Two of Paul Fairall and Stanley Yeo, Criminal Defences in Australia, 4th ed (2005) LexisNexis Butterworths. The following taxonomy of offences is founded on He Kaw Teh v The Queen [1985] HCA 43; (1985) 157 CLR 423, as summarised in R v Wampfler (1987) 11 NSWLR 541 at p 546. 

29Most serious offences require proof of some sort of mental element. Common examples are intention, knowledge and recklessness. If a defendant has made a mistake of fact relevant to a requisite mental element, he or she may rely on that in order to demonstrate that the prosecution has failed to prove the mental element beyond reasonable doubt. So, for example, in a murder trial in which the accused is alleged to have killed the deceased with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm by stabbing the deceased in the chest with a knife, it would be open to the accused to point to the fact that he or she believed that the knife was a plastic toy, and was merely playing when he or she pushed it into the chest of the deceased. Such a mistaken belief need not be reasonable. Indeed, even if it is quite unreasonable, it may nevertheless operate to exculpate the accused.

30Offences of strict liability constitute the second category of offences. The seminal Australian case is Proudman v Dayman [1941] HCA 28; (1941) 67 CLR 536. These are offences with regard to which no mental element need be proven by the prosecution, but the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available. Once the accused points to ""some evidence"" of that ""defence"", it is incumbent upon the prosecution to disprove it beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution will succeed if it proves beyond reasonable doubt either that the mistaken belief was not honestly held, or that the mistake was not a reasonable one. A well-known example of such an offence is that of dangerous driving occasioning death, contained in s 52A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. For a discussion of how honest and reasonable mistake of fact operates with regard to the very similar predecessor of that offence, see Jiminez v The Queen [1992] HCA 14; (1992) 173 CLR 572.

31Because of the fact that the accused need only raise honest and reasonable mistake of fact and, then it must be disproven by the prosecution, it can be misleading to refer to it as a defence. Doing so can appear to equate it with a true defence, with regard to which an accused bears the onus of persuading the tribunal of fact on the balance of probabilities. A well-known example of a true defence is mental illness. In this judgment, I refer to honest and reasonable mistake of fact as a ""defence"", in order to draw that distinction.

32Offences of absolutely liability are those which do not attract the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, and constitute the third category of offences. In other words, once the physical elements of the offence are made out, the offence is proven. For an example of the Court of Criminal Appeal determining that a driving offence was an absolute liability offence, see R v Walker (1994) 35 NSWLR 384.

33Determining whether a statutory offence is one of strict or absolute liability is a question of construction. For a recent example of the High Court determining whether a statutory offence is one of strict or absolute liability, see CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25; (2008) 236 CLR 440. 

34The question may be asked: to what quality of evidence must the defendant point with regard to a ""defence"", in order to require the prosecution to disprove it beyond reasonable doubt? In answering that question, criminal lawyers usually adopt the shorthand of ""some evidence"", or ""some reasonable evidence"", of such a ""defence"".

35In CTM v The Queen, the plurality did not go beyond using the well-known phrase ""evidential burden"" in discussing what the defendant must discharge. However, Hayne J did consider this question, and quoted at [179] from the judgment of Dawson J in He Kaw Teh v The Queen as follows:

""Questions of mistake need be considered at a criminal trial only if the issue is alive. As Dawson J pointed out in He Kaw Teh: 

""[T]he burden of providing the necessary foundation in evidence will in most cases fall upon the accused. But it is not inconceivable that during the case for the prosecution sufficient evidence may be elicited by way of cross-examination or otherwise to establish honest and reasonable mistake or to cast sufficient doubt upon the prosecution case to entitle the accused to an acquittal. The governing principle must be that which applies generally in the criminal law. There is no onus upon the accused to prove honest and reasonable mistake upon the balance of probabilities. The prosecution must prove his guilt and the accused is not bound to establish his innocence. It is sufficient for him to raise a doubt about his guilt and this may be done, if the offence is not one of absolute liability, by raising the question of honest and reasonable mistake. If the prosecution at the end of the case has failed to dispel the doubt then the accused must be acquitted."""" (footnotes omitted)

36A more expansive definition of the evidential burden is contained in J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence, 8th ed (2010) LexisNexis Butterworths. There it is said at [9120], p 359:

""When the accused bears the evidential burden alone, it is only necessary for there to be such evidence as would, if believed and uncontradicted, induce a reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable jury as to whether the accused's version might not be true, for example as to whether the accused was provoked or in a state of automatism.

In the words of Lord Devlin, the evidence must be enough to 'suggest a reasonable possibility'. There must be some evidence, derived either from the prosecution or adduced by the defence; it is not enough to rely upon an out-of-court self-serving statement, and probably not enough to have equivocal evidence from which the jury is invited to draw a medical inference, itself contradicted by the evidence of a doctor."" (footnotes omitted).

37It follows from the foregoing, that if I had been asked Question Four, I would have answered it as follows:

Question Four: In this trial, is the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact a defence available at law? 

Answer: In light of the concession of senior counsel for the plaintiff, yes. 

Question Four: If so, what must be shown, by which party, and to what standard?

Answer: The defendant must point to some reasonable evidence of an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Once the defendant has done so, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to disprove the ""defence"" beyond reasonable doubt. 

38It is important to note that the ""defence"" is restricted to honest and reasonable mistake of fact. A mistake of law will almost never operate to exculpate a defendant in a criminal matter: ignorance of the law is no excuse. Whilst it is notorious that it is not easy to draw a bright line between matters of fact and matters of law, the High Court has reasonably recently discussed the distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law in the criminal setting: Ostrowksi v Palmer. In that case, as it happens also a fishing prosecution, a perfectly honest and reasonable mistake of law did not avail the defendant.

Legal error in the Local Court?

39Turning to the two passages extracted in this judgment, I do not perceive error in the first of them. In particular, I do not see error in the sentence ""I do not accept that the duality of the Commonwealth and State provisions, in any way, undermines the availability of honest and reasonable mistake of fact"". I respectfully agree with the Magistrate that the fact this prosecution may involve an interaction between the Act and the Native Title Act does not somehow restrict the operation of the ""defence"".

40As for the second extracted passage, I do respectfully think that it was an error to say ""[i]n terms of the onus; the onus is on the defendant, in my view, to establish on the balance of probabilities the honest and reasonable belief"", and what follows after that. As I have said above, in truth the onus is on the defendant to point to some evidence of the ""defence"", and then the onus shifts to the prosecution. For an example of a case in which it was held that the accused had not discharged the evidential onus with regard to honest and reasonable mistake of fact, see CTM v R. It is not incumbent upon a defendant to prove the ""defence"" on the balance of probabilities as a preliminary matter. But that is not an error of which the plaintiff complained in these proceedings. That is not surprising, as it was an error that was not adverse to the plaintiff.

41The sentence ""it was put to me by the defendant that mistake of fact would of course be, in this particular circumstance, a mistaken belief in native title rights"" is, as a statement of what counsel for the defendants had submitted to the Magistrate, not erroneous. However, I accept that the subsequent sentences demonstrate a conflation of questions of mistake of fact and law. In that respect, I reject the submission of counsel for the defendant that the ""defence"" could include a mistake as to whether or not native title existed. It seems to me that a mistake as to whether or not one possessed a legal title is not a mistake of fact. A mistake as to one of the facts that could give rise to native title could be a mistake of fact, so long as its subject matter were exculpatory. But a consideration of that question is hypothetical in the extreme. As I have indicated, leaving aside the document containing agreed facts pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act, not a single piece of evidence has been led yet in the proceedings by either party.

42I am not persuaded by the submissions of senior counsel for the plaintiff that there is some disjunction between the onus being on the defendants to satisfy the Magistrate on the balance of probabilities that the Native Title Act suspends the operation of the offence creating provisions, and the onus being cast on the prosecution to disprove honest and reasonable mistake of fact beyond reasonable doubt once it has been raised by the defendants. After all, it is not uncommon for there to be sufficiently raised in a murder trial the true defence of mental illness and the ""defences"" of self-defence or provocation. Those different onuses co-exist without difficulty.

43I am also not persuaded by the submissions of senior counsel for the plaintiff that, if the ""defence"" were to apply to native title, then one would expect one or other of the Parliaments to have said so. Once it is accepted that the common law ""defence"" exists with regard to the offences, it would be surprising for either Parliament to have attempted to add to or subtract from that common law ""defence"". There may be many facts that could fall within the ""defence"", so long as they are relevant to negativing culpability for the offence charged.

44But in any event, I believe that the issues to which senior counsel for the plaintiff invited my attention fall away once the distinction is appropriately drawn between mistakes of fact and law. 

Prayers 1 and 3

45I accept the submission of counsel for the defendants that there were no orders made in the Local Court amenable to appeal. I propose therefore to refuse Prayers 1 and 3. 

Making a declaration?

46Error having been established, the question is whether the plaintiff has persuaded me that I should exercise my discretion to make the declaration in Prayer 4. 

47One of the primary concerns in exercising that discretion relates to the hypothetical nature of the effect of that declaration on the rights of the parties. The probability of whether the facts or events that are said to require the making of the declaration will actually arise affects the exercise of the discretion to issue a declaration. I note the statement of general principle by Jacobs J in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at p 24:

""A declaration of right based on facts found in the particular case can certainly be made but it is not permissible to make a declaration of right which amounts to a conclusion of fact from a hypothetical or assumed state of facts and thereby to enunciate or declare a rule of apparently general application as though it were a declaration of applicable law. A declaration of right based on hypothetical or assumed facts may be made when the assumed facts can be certainly and exhaustively stated and when the conclusion flowing therefrom is truly a conclusion of law but not when it is itself a conclusion of fact.""

48In light of the state of the evidence in this matter, those considerations are important here.

49Declarations in relation to criminal proceedings have attracted particular judicial circumspection on the part of the High Court of Australia. In Sankey v Whitlam Gibbs ACJ said at pp 25-26: 

""In any case in which a declaration can be and is sought on a question of evidence or procedure, the circumstances must be most exceptional to warrant the grant of relief. The power to make declaratory orders has proved to be a valuable addition to the armoury of the law. The procedure involved is simple and free from technicalties [sic]; properly used in an appropriate case the use of the power enables the salient issue to be determined with the least possible delay and expense. But the procedure is open to abuse, particularly in criminal cases, and if wrongly used can cause the very evils it is designed to avoid. Applications for declarations as to the admissibility of evidence may in some cases be made by an accused person for purposes of delay, or by a prosecutor to impose an additional burden on the accused, but even when such an application is made without any improper motive it is likely to be dilatory in effect, to fragment the proceedings and to detract from the efficiency of the criminal process. I am not intending to criticize those concerned with the conduct of Bourke v. Hamilton, or to show any disrespect for the careful judgments delivered in that matter-indeed I have derived much assistance from them-when I say that that case provides an example of the way in which criminal proceedings may be needlessly protracted if they are interrupted by an application for a declaration-in the end the declaration sought was refused but the proceedings had been delayed for the space of almost a year. The present case itself is another regrettable example of the delay that can be caused by departures from the normal course of procedure. For these reasons I would respectfully endorse the observations of Jacobs P. (as he then was) in Shapowloff v. Dunn, that a court will be reluctant to make declarations in a matter which impinges directly upon the course of proceedings in a criminal matter. Once criminal proceedings have begun they should be allowed to follow their ordinary course unless it appears that for some special reason it is necessary in the interests of justice to make a declaratory order. Although these remarks may be no more than mere ""administrative cautions"" (cf. Ibeneweka v. Egbuna) I nevertheless consider that if a judge failed to give proper weight to these matters it could not be said that he had properly exercised his discretion."" (footnotes omitted)

50The High Court has also said in R v Iorlano; Ex parte Attorney-General (Cth) [1983] HCA 43; (1983) 151 CLR 678 at p 680:

""[I]t is highly undesirable to interrupt the ordinary course of criminal proceedings by applications for leave to appeal or prerogative relief for the purpose of challenging rulings on questions of admissibility of evidence.""

51In Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 236 CLR 120 the plurality said at [23]:

""With respect to the exercise of the power to make the declaratory orders now sought by the applicants, authority in this Court affirms an important general principle. This is that power to make declaratory orders should be exercised sparingly where the declaration would touch the conduct of criminal proceedings. The fragmentation of the criminal process is to be actively discouraged."" (footnotes omitted)

52Senior counsel for the plaintiff noted that, in that case, a declaration was indeed made. But it is important that that was done in a context where both parties sought the declaration, and what was sought touched on the construction of an important Act and its operation - the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. In the words of the plurality at [25]:

""There is a considerable public interest in the observance of due process by law enforcement authorities by putting beyond doubt important questions of construction of the [Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act].""

53As noted above, senior counsel for the plaintiff in these proceedings also invited my attention to another case where a declaration was issued to intervene in criminal proceedings, Rozenes v Beljajev. During the trial at first instance in that matter, the trial judge ruled that his Honour had a residual discretion to exclude the admissible evidence of a Crown witness. The pre-empanelment motions in the trial had dragged on for a lengthy period by the time the trial judge gave that indication, and without the excluded evidence the prosecution case would have collapsed. In relation to the jurisdiction of a Court to exercise its discretion to grant a declaration in a criminal matter, in particular relating to an evidentiary ruling, the Supreme Court of Victoria said at p 520:

""[I]n circumstances which were ""most exceptional"" it was appropriate to grant a declaration that the documents were not privileged from production. His Honour [Gibbs ACJ in Sankey] noted as relevant that ""the proceedings have already been long delayed (as) a cogent reason for putting them (the questions) to rest"". A number of factors may be mentioned which suggest that declaratory relief is appropriate in the present case: the very great delay since these matters arose in 1989; the course which the proceeding has taken in the County Court; the ruling of the judge as to the nature of the discretion to exclude evidence; the question whether a judge should proceed in the way in which his Honour did, regardless of whether such a discretion exists; the profound consequences of the rulings for the present trial and (if those rulings are correct) their possible consequences for the criminal justice system in Victoria.""

Those kinds of extreme circumstances may be contrasted with the position here. 

54A similar admonition against fragmentation of the criminal process by way of declaration and other relief in this Court can be found in Smith v Commissioner of Corrective Services [1978] 1 NSWLR 317 at p 329.

55A major concern that Courts have in refusing to grant declarations in situations where the criminal process has already begun is to allow the criminal process to function in its own statutory context. In other words, where there is already a comprehensive statutory appeal and review mechanism in place, as is the case here, the Courts are reluctant to exercise their discretion to issue a declaration: see, for example, Hill v Green [1999] NSWCA 477; (1999) 48 NSWLR 161 at [163].

56The review of these cases leads me to the conclusion that, whilst this Court has a discretion to issue a declaration in relation to criminal proceedings in the Local Court, it would require ""most exceptional"" circumstances.

57For the following reasons I am not persuaded that this case falls within the ""most exceptional"" circumstances contemplated above.

58First, I do not believe that the rulings of the Magistrate have any great formality attached to them. Reliance on s 139 of the Criminal Procedure Act seems, with respect, to have been misconceived, because in its terms and by its location within the Criminal Procedure Act, that section is, it seems to me, referring to trials on indictment. Having said that, I do not seek to discourage counsel in summary hearings from discussing the issues with the magistrate before the evidence commences in appropriate cases. But these were not formal orders, or judgments. To my mind they were indications of how the Magistrate conceived of various aspects of substantive law and procedure.

59Secondly, despite the reticence expressed by senior counsel for the plaintiff with regard to cavilling with her Honour's rulings, I do not think it would be inappropriate for the parties to approach the matter again with her Honour. That is particularly the case when, unfortunately, the leading High Court decision on the distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law with regard to criminal liability had not been brought to the attention of her Honour. I would have thought that, just as a ruling on evidence may be revisited, so may a ruling before the evidence starts, such as this one.

60Indeed, the matter may not finally crystallise unless and until the defendants tender evidence said to be relevant to the ""defence"", and the plaintiff objects to it. Only then will the parameters need to be definitively determined.

61Thirdly, I am very mindful of the warnings against fragmentation of criminal proceedings. In my experience, it is almost unheard of for a summary hearing, or indeed a trial on indictment, in which the magistrate or judge has, before the evidence commenced, made a ruling as to certain legal questions, to then be the subject of a declaration of this Court as to an error perceived by one or other of the parties in those rulings.

62Fourthly, nothing particularly exceptional has happened in these summary proceedings. A summary hearing is expected to lead to consideration of whether native title applies to suspend the offence-creating provisions. Separately, it may involve the ""defence"". Parties have made submissions about the way forward, and the Magistrate has made some rulings. Whilst the potential operation of native title in criminal proceedings is somewhat unusual, it does not seem to me, taken as a whole, that these proceedings are wholly exceptional.

63Fifthly, it is quite possible that many of these questions will turn out not to arise on the evidence. As I have said, apart from the document prepared pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act, no evidence has been tendered or called. It may be that, ultimately, no evidence will be led with regard to the ""defence"". If it is led, it may be excluded; if it is not excluded, it may be that the evidence will be quite circumscribed. I am not inclined to make a declaration that may well turn out to be quite unnecessary on the evidence in the case.

64Sixthly, the submission that the matter is already fragmented and delayed and therefore making the declaration will not make matters worse is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the plaintiff had not decided to come to this Court, the matter would not have been fragmented. 

65Seventhly, the fact that the application to adjourn the matter was a joint one does not, to my mind, carry much weight. It is clear that counsel for the defendants was a little surprised by the application pursuant to s 139 of the Criminal Procedure Act on the first day of the hearing; as it turns out, perhaps understandably. I infer, that on the following day, he wished to consider his position after the five questions had been answered. 

66Eighthly, I would not wish any declaration that I were to make to operate as a precedent or encouragement for similar fragmentation of future summary prosecutions.

67In short, although the plaintiff has demonstrated error in the Court below, I decline to make the declaration sought in the summons. The matter should simply proceed before the Magistrate in the usual way. 

Conclusion

68In summary with regard to the relief claimed:

(1)I propose to dismiss Prayers 1 and 3 on the basis that there was no order made in the Local Court.

(2)I propose to dismiss Prayer 2 on the basis that it was not pressed by the plaintiff.

(3)I propose to dismiss Prayer 4 on the basis that, although error was identified, I decline to exercise my discretion to make a declaration.

(4)I decline to make Prayer 5 on the basis that is unnecessary.

(5)As for costs, the plaintiff has not claimed costs in the summons or in oral submissions. Counsel for the defendants requested that I permit him liberty to apply within 7 days of the publication of this judgment as to costs. I am prepared to so order. But it may be helpful for me state that, in light of my finding of legal error in the Court below, along with my rejection of an important submission of counsel for the defendants, my preliminary inclination is that no order for costs should be made.

Orders

69I make the following orders:

(1)Summons dismissed.

(2)Defendants to have liberty to apply until 4pm, 1 August 2012, for an order as to costs.

		26 July 2012",2012-07-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2707919,Application of Malcolm Huntley Potier [2012] NSWCA 222,"Judgment

1JUDGMENT of the COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: The applicant, Mr Potier, is presently in custody serving a sentence having been convicted of a serious indictable offence. He is not entitled to institute civil proceedings in any court except by leave of the court: Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW) (""the 1981 Act""), s 4. The Court is not entitled to grant such leave unless satisfied that the proposed proceeding is not an abuse of process and that there is prima facie ground for it: s 5.

2In November 2008 the applicant sought leave to commence four sets of proceedings by summons issued in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. The proposed proceedings were as follows:

(a) a claim against the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, being matter 16296/2008;
(b) a claim against Mr David Arnott SC, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General, being matter 16303/2008;
(c) a claim against the applicant's trial representatives, McGowan Lawyers and Mr Terrence Healey, barrister, being matter 16305/2008, and
(d) a claim against the Commissioner of Corrective Services, being matter 16307/2008.

3On 9 March 2010, RS Hulme J refused the applicant leave to bring each of the proposed proceedings: Potier v Arnott [2010] NSWSC 144.

4A person refused leave to commence proceedings may appeal against the refusal ""as if the decision to refuse the leave were a decision on a point of law"": s 6(1). Leave is required with respect to the appeal: s 6(2). The language of s 6(1) is obscure, but need not be considered further in this case.

5Pursuant to the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""the UCPR""), Pt 51, an application for leave to appeal is to be filed and served within 28 days of the date of the judgment from which the appeal is brought, unless a notice of intention to seek to leave to appeal is filed and served within that time, in which case the time for filing a summons seeking leave is extended to three months: rr 51.8, 51.9 and 51.10.

6The applicant failed to comply with those time constraints and accordingly sought an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal and also sought a direction for referral for pro bono legal assistance in this Court. Those applications came before Handley AJA who granted the extension of time but refused a direction for pro bono legal assistance: Potier v Arnott [2012] NSWCA 5. 

7In respect of the extension of time, Handley AJA stated at [2]:

""The delay, which was caused by the restrictions on Mr Potier's liberty, has been explained and there is no conceivable prejudice to the respondents. This procedural difficulty will be cured by extending the time for filing the summons for leave to appeal to 29 April 2010.""

8In refusing directions for pro bono legal assistance, Handley AJA considered in respect of each proceeding whether he was able to discern any merit in the claims. He described the various claims as ""hopeless"" (at [14]), ""a waste of the relevant barrister's time"" (at [15] and [22]), and lacking any prima facie ground (at [32], [41] and [43]). Those conclusions might have resulted in a refusal of the application for an extension of time. However, time having been extended, it is necessary for this Court to consider the applications for leave to appeal in respect of each proceeding.

9The applications being listed before this Court, the applicant attended and was given leave to appear on the application pursuant to s 7(a) of the 1981 Act. Counsel representing four of the seven proposed defendants were present but there was no grant of leave to any of them to appear or be represented pursuant to s 7(b). Despite the manner in which the judgments in these matters and the papers in this matter have been entituled, this was an ex parte application, to which there were no respondents. The Court was mindful that such applications should not, by default, become adversary proceedings. Accordingly, the Court was not minded to give leave to any of the proposed defendants to appear, there being no apparent purpose in obtaining further assistance with respect to the application. Each case will, of course, need to be considered according to its own circumstances.

10Subject to one immaterial mistake, we see no reason to doubt the correctness of the views as to the merits of the claims expressed by Handley AJA in considering the application for pro bono assistance. It follows that we see no reasonable prospects of overturning the decisions of Hulme J in refusing leave to commence the proceedings.

11Before turning to the individual proceedings, two preliminary issues should be addressed. 

Principle of finality
12First, each of the proposed proceedings involves a claim for damages referable to the adverse outcome for the applicant of the criminal proceedings which have resulted in his current incarceration. In each case, accordingly, the applicant must confront the reasoning of the High Court in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; 223 CLR 1. In that case, the applicant had been charged with a serious criminal offence. He had obtained legal aid and a barrister briefed by Victoria Legal Aid to appear for him in defending the charge. He originally entered a plea of guilty, but when committed to the County Court of Victoria, reversed the plea and stood trial. His plea was led in evidence and he was convicted. On appeal, the conviction was quashed and, on retrial, the applicant was acquitted. He sued both Victoria Legal Aid and his barrister in negligence. The particulars of loss and damage included loss of liberty following his first conviction, psychological harm and the expenses of the retrial.

13The present proposed pleadings do not particularise loss and damage, but the applicant accepts that these would be the kinds of damage he would expect to receive, with the addition of exemplary damages.

14The importance of the reasoning in D'Orta-Ekenaike is that the principal judgment (of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) abandoned traditional policy justifications for the immunity of those involved in judicial proceedings and placed the immunity squarely on the need for finality in litigation. The judgment stated at [43]:

""The 'unique and essential function' of the judicial branch is the quelling of controversies by the ascertainment of the facts and the application of the law. Once a controversy has been quelled, it is not to be re-litigated. Yet re-litigation of the controversy would be an inevitable and essential step in demonstrating that an advocate's negligence in the conduct of litigation had caused damage to the client.""

15D'Orta-Ekenaike was, in one sense, a stronger case for the plaintiff than is the present. The plaintiff had ultimately been acquitted. Accordingly, his claim related to what might be categorised as the erroneous intermediate outcome of the criminal proceedings, being the trial resulting in his conviction which was later quashed. Even in that circumstance, the Court upheld the summary dismissal of the civil claim. The immunity of the advocate extended to the immunity of Victoria Legal Aid.

Test for grant of leave
16Secondly, it is necessary to refer to the statutory test for leave to commence proceedings. It was not suggested by the primary judge that the proceedings otherwise involved an abuse of process if there was ""prima facie ground"" for them. In Ford v Simes [2009] NSWCA 351, Bergin CJ in Eq, with the agreement of Tobias JA and Handley AJA, stated at [31]:

""The expression 'prima facie ground' in s 5 of the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act as it applies to this application, means no more than a ground of appeal that is arguable or not totally hopeless.""

17Taken literally, that limb of the test refers to a claim which at first sight and without investigation appears to be a ""ground"". Taken in its statutory context, it is properly understood as referring to a ground which on its face is not hopeless or unarguable. That test requires reference to the legal principles invoked by the cause of action upon which the claim is based and reference to the factual allegations contained in the proposed pleading. The purpose of the legislative scheme was, in part, to overcome the perceived injustice resulting from the decision in Dugan v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1978] HCA 54; 142 CLR 583 that a convicted felon could not sue at law or in equity. On the other hand, the purpose of the statute was to permit the court to ensure that neither it nor prospective defendants were subjected to proceedings which were an abuse of process or which lacked any real merit: Jol v State of New South Wales (1998) 45 NSWLR 283 at 286E (Sheller JA, Beazley JA and Sheppard AJA agreeing). As with a summary dismissal application, the court is not required to embark upon a detailed analysis of the claims and the evidence which might support them, but rather is to form a broad impression as to whether a claim enjoys a realistic prospect of success and is thus not ""hopeless"" or ""unarguable"". Different expressions used from time-to-time do not indicate any difference in the standard to be applied.

(1) The Legal Aid Commission claims
18The claims against the Legal Aid Commission were twofold. The first concerned a refusal by the Commission to pay the expenses demanded by Telstra for compliance with a subpoena issued to Telstra during the first trial. The second aspect of the claim concerned the delay in providing legal aid.

19In respect of the Telstra records, the written submissions by the plaintiff in the Common Law Division stated (at paragraph 4) that ""[h]ad the Telstra Material been obtained then it could have been submitted to the Jury in 2001 and having regard to all of the other factors, it is probable that a different verdict [would have been] reached"". It will be seen that this cause of action runs squarely into the principle of finality in respect of the criminal proceedings, which was determinative in D'Orta-Ekenaike. 

20The complaint in respect of delay in providing funds itself appeared to have two limbs. The first concerned the failure to provide funds in a timely fashion in respect of the second sentencing hearing. The complaint was that aid was provided, but only the day before the hearing. Again, to demonstrate loss and damage, it would be necessary to show that the delay had an adverse effect on the outcome. That course would not be open. Such relief as was available depended upon an application to the sentencing judge to adjourn the proceedings. If such an application were made and wrongly refused, the proper relief would be by way of an application for leave to appeal in respect of the sentence, which we were told had been lodged but not yet determined.

21The other element of complaint is apparently the delay in determining whether to grant aid in respect of the applicant's High Court appeal. However, legal aid was ultimately refused, a decision which cannot be challenged by a claim for damages, but may be subject to other forms of review. 

22Handley AJA remarked that the delay in dealing with the application for aid to seek leave to appeal to the High Court was ""extraordinary and very troubling, and [revealed] a sorry state of affairs"": at [37]. No doubt the delay was extraordinary, but that fact alone did not lead to an inference that the causes of the delay were to be laid at the feet of the Commission. The applicant was invited in the course of argument to draw this Court's attention to any material which might give rise to such an inference, but was unable to do so. The applicant submitted, strenuously, that the error on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of the first conviction was manifest. However, that description did not entail a necessary conclusion that the error was material, or of a kind which would give rise to relief on the basis of Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218, as the applicant submitted. That proposition was analysed by R A Hulme J in relation to a bail application: Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 234 at [8]-[14]. Resolution of that issue is not necessary for present purposes, nor did the applicant suggest it was.

23The principal basis upon which these proceedings were held not to have prima facie grounds was the statutory protection provided to the Commission and its staff against any action, liability, claim or demand for an ""act or omission done, or omitted to be done, in good faith for the purpose of executing this Act"": Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 (NSW), s 27(1). 

24In respect of this test, two questions arise. The first is whether the statutory protection provides a defence to be established by the prospective defendant, or whether a lack of good faith is an element of the claim required to be proved by the plaintiff in order to justify an action being brought against the Commission. Secondly, there is a question as to what might be thought to constitute evidence of a lack of good faith. Taking these two matters together, it may be correct to say that if the Court must ultimately be persuaded affirmatively by the defendant that the officers of the Commission acted in good faith, the applicant would not be required to prove (affirmatively) that they acted in bad faith. Nevertheless, the point remains that the proceedings will have no realistic prospect of success unless some factual basis is available to demonstrate lack of good faith.

25Both the primary judge and Handley AJA found there was a total absence of evidence supporting a claim that the relevant acts of the Commission were done otherwise than in good faith. Nothing has been put before this Court to demonstrate error in that assessment. However, the applicant took issue with what he perceived to be a slide in the reasons of Handley AJA and of the primary judge from the need to establish a lack of good faith on the part of the Commission to a discussion of what might provide evidence of ""bad faith"": [2012] NSWCA 5 at [41].

26The primary point relied upon by the applicant is that his own counsel, appointed by the Commission, had recommended payment of the fee of $2,400 required by Telstra for production of the subpoenaed records. On the other hand, the applicant's submissions suggest that a further disbursement, in fact sought in the second trial, totalling $5,000, would have been necessary in order to obtain an expert analysis of the records. Whether or not that were so, the Commission had no statutory obligation to approve any particular expenditure, whether it was recommended by counsel or not. It is a daily occurrence for the Commission to obtain counsel's advice as to the merits of claims and steps in proceedings, which advice may properly be used in considering whether to provide some form of legal aid, without in any way binding the Commission. That conclusion is inevitable, given the obligations imposed on the Commission, for example, pursuant to ss 12 and 30 of the Legal Aid Commission Act. Accordingly, a refusal to incur an expense supported by counsel's advice provides no basis for challenging the good faith of the Commission.

27Leave must be refused in respect of the proposed appeal.

(2) Claim against prosecution
28The applicant sought to bring proceedings against Mr David Arnott SC, who was the prosecutor at his first criminal trial in 2001, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General.

29The basis of the claim against the Attorney was unclear and arguably misconceived. It appears that his alleged liability was a form of derivative liability based on the misconduct of the prosecution at the criminal trial. If that were so, there might have been a claim against the State of New South Wales pursuant to the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW) (""Vicarious Liability Act"") and the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW). However, that is a technical matter which could be remedied and is immaterial for present purposes.

30The underlying cause of action, stated in negligence, was a breach of the prosecutor's duty to disclose relevant material at the trial, that being the material with respect to the telephone records which was obtained from Telstra, but apparently not given to the defence.

31To say that the prosecution has a ""duty"" with respect to the conduct of a criminal trial is not to say that the accused has a corresponding entitlement to bring a claim in damages for breach of that duty. The remedy is to be found within the criminal proceedings and any appeal from a conviction. The claim now sought to be brought is squarely inconsistent with the reasoning is D'Orta-Ekenaike.

32The applicant sought to rely in his written submissions on a statement derived from the judgment of McHugh J in D'Orta-Ekenaike at [99], that a prosecutor ""can be sued for the damage to the liberty and reputation of the defendant"" but only when the prosecutor acted ""maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause"". McHugh J went on to say:

""Moreover, the action is not in negligence but for the tort of malicious prosecution.""

33The present claim was not initially made in respect of such a tort, although an amendment to the foreshadowed pleading now seeks to rely on that cause of action. However, that tort has entirely different elements from the tort of negligence. In particular, it is an essential element of the tort of malicious prosecution that the proceedings must have terminated unsuccessfully for the prosecution: A v State of New South Wales [2007] HCA 10; 230 CLR 500 at [1]. That is not so in the present case. Further, the applicant's reliance on the description by McHugh J as to the barrister's duty to do nothing that would obstruct the administration of justice does not provide any basis for creating a right to compensation arising from a breach of that duty to the court: D'Orta-Ekenaike, at [111].

34If follows that these proceedings also are without any prima facie ground and are, in a technical sense, an abuse of process. Leave to appeal in respect of the prosecution claim should be refused.

(3) Claim against defence lawyers
35The claim against the applicant's own counsel and solicitor was a claim in negligence based primarily on their failure to properly examine and follow instructions with respect to the recordings of the telephone conversations which were also at the heart of the second criminal trial. As Handley AJA recognised, such a claim could not succeed in the face of D'Orta-Ekenaike.

36The applicant sought to distinguish D'Orta-Ekenaike on the basis that it was not concerned with a contractual duty, as existed at least between the applicant and his solicitor. However, that is not a valid point of distinction. First, D'Orta-Ekenaike upheld summary dismissal of proceedings against the advocate and the instructing solicitor. Secondly, the joint judgment expressly stated that there was ""no sound basis for distinguishing between advocates according to whether the advocate does or does not have a contract with the client"": at [25].

37The second limb of the claim related to the withdrawal of both counsel and solicitor in the course of the trial, apparently after a particular witness had given an answer to a question which was extremely prejudicial to the applicant, following which, however, the trial judge had declined to discharge the jury. The reason for counsel and solicitor withdrawing was not pleaded, other than by way of a denial that it was on the applicant's instruction. However, further explanation was provided in the course of oral submissions.

38It appears from the transcript of 14 September 2006 that Mr Healey withdrew from acting for the applicant on 7 September 2006. On 14 September, Mr Healey was called as a witness on the voir dire and was questioned by both the applicant and counsel for the prosecution as to the circumstances of his withdrawal. The contents of a note written by the applicant to Mr Healey were read onto the record: Tcpt, 14/09/06, p 799 (37)-(45). In answer to questions from the prosecutor, Mr Healey then recounted the whole of the conversation which he had had with the applicant: Tcpt, pp 800-804.

39A review of this material does not assist the applicant. There is no prima facie ground demonstrating breach of duty, but an inquiry into the conduct and its consequences will inevitably challenge the finality of the criminal proceedings. By contrast, misconduct on the part of legal representatives may constitute a ground of appeal if it causes a miscarriage of justice: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [6]-[8] (Gleeson CJ). The primary judge noted that the point may in fact have been raised in the criminal appeal: [2010] NSWSC 144 at [23]. Whether or not that is so is not of present relevance and need not be explored further.

(4) Claim against Commissioner of Corrective Services
40The first matter raised in this complaint was that the applicant's appeal had been delayed by the failure of the prison authorities to provide him with adequate access to his legal papers, which were said to be in excess of 40,000 pages, in addition to computer files. His statement of issues asserted (paragraph 3) that ""for appointed counsel to consider the grounds of possible appeal required me to review in detail all of the material and comprehensively instruct counsel"".

41The second matter raised in respect of the conditions of his imprisonment, concerned the need to comply with High Court rules requiring applications to be typed and filed with multiple copies, ""in person"" in the Registry. He asserted that because he was unable to comply with those conditions he had been prevented from exercising his right of access to the High Court for the purposes of a special leave application.

42Before Handley AJA it appears that the applicant's primary claim was that the Commissioner had given a ""binding undertaking"" to the Court to rectify certain unlawful conditions of imprisonment, in habeas corpus proceedings brought against the Commissioner in the Supreme Court. Handley AJA referred to the judgments in each proceeding, but noted there was no reference to any enforceable undertaking. His Honour further noted that if it were a failure to comply with an undertaking which underlay the principal complaint of the applicant, the appropriate relief was not be found in a claim for compensation. 

43Handley AJA also referred to the statutory protective provision in respect of prison officers. The provision referred to at [27] was s 46(1) of the Correctional Centres Act 1952 (NSW). That provision had, however, been repealed on 3 April 2000, the current provision being s 263 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) which expressly refers to ""omissions"" as well as actions.

44While it is true that s 263 might protect the Commissioner because the acts or omissions relied upon were not shown to be otherwise than ""done ... in good faith in the administration or execution of this Act"", there would nevertheless be an arguable case of liability on the part of the State for any otherwise tortious conduct on the part of the Commissioner: Vicarious Liability Act, ss 8 and 10.

45The real problem in the present case is that the applicant has failed to identify any cause of action which would give rise to a claim in damages, or any prima facie ground for such a claim. For these reasons, leave to appeal should be refused.

Conclusions
46It follows from these reasons that leave to appeal from the refusal to grant permission to institute the four sets of proceedings should be refused. Pursuant to the 1981 Act, the applicant was not entitled to appear in person without leave of the Court, nor were any of the prospective respondents entitled to appear or be represented without leave. The applicant did seek leave to appear, which was granted during the hearing..

47The Legal Aid Commission, apparently at the invitation of the Registrar, sought leave to appeal and opposed the application. It filed brief written submissions in support of its application, but did not seek costs. In the circumstances, there is no need to address the submissions nor to rule upon its application for leave to appear, as the Commission did not require that the leave application be dealt with in open court.

		25 July 2012",2012-07-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2707922,Independent Commission Against Corruption v Karkowski [2012] NSWLC 6,"Judgment

1The offender appears before the Court to be sentenced in relation to 5 counts of corruptly receiving a benefit and 2 counts of fraud. The charges are brought pursuant to section 249B(1)(a)(i) and section 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. Four of the counts of corruptly receiving a benefit are to be the subject of a sentence. One count has been placed on a Form 1 under section 32 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The charges arise out of an investigation conducted by and a hearing before the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

2The maximum penalty for an offence against section 249B(1)(a)(i) is 7 years imprisonment when dealt with on indictment. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to section 192E(1)(b) is 10 years imprisonment. The prosecution makes no election to proceed on indictment. 

3When prosecuted to finality within the Local Court an offence of fraud is a Table 1 offence within the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 attracting a jurisdictional maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment. The maximum jurisdictional penalty for the offence of corruptly receiving a benefit, inducement or reward depends on the value of the benefit or reward obtained. Where the benefit or reward exceeds $5,000 the offence falls within Table 1 of the Act. Where the benefit or reward is less than this figure the offence is classified as a Table 2 offence. In such instance the maximum jurisdictional penalty is 12 months imprisonment. Based on the facts tendered by the prosecution each of these charges fall within the ambit of Table 2.

4Having outlined the legislative provisions affecting the determination of these proceedings I formally note that whilst the maximum jurisdiction of the Local Court on sentence is constrained to a defined jurisdictional limit the objective seriousness of an offence is nonetheless to be determined by reference to the legislative maximum penalty not the jurisdictional constraint. So much is made clear in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 

5As the Court said in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 215 ALR 213 at 222:

... careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time and thirdly because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all other relevant factors; a yardstick.

6Against these heads of consideration it cannot be said that the matters before the Court in these proceedings represent the worst possible case. The election by the DPP to choose the Local Court as the jurisdiction in which to bring these matters to finality rather than proceed on indictment is a concession by the Crown that the objective seriousness of the charges do not represent the worst category of offending and do not warrant an outcome that exceeds either separately or by way of accumulation, the jurisdiction of this Court. The Court agrees that this is a proper approach in this instance. In my view the individual and collective acts of offending place the objective seriousness of these matters towards the lower end of the middle range category of offending. Such a view does not however lead to a conclusion that the appropriate sentence should not be one of condign punishment.

The Facts

7A comprehensive statement of Crown facts is attached to the charge papers. For the sake of conciseness I have abridged them. 

8Sequence 1
For a 12-month period from 31 August 2009 - 1 September 2010 the offender received sexual services from the proprietors of the Oriana Bath House in Chatswood in return for not reporting to Council the fact of its existence and operation as an illegal brothel. The DPP asserts, and the offender does not dispute the assertion that the value of sexual services rendered to the offender was $2,000. According to the agreed facts this represents at least 20 separate occasions upon which the offender availed himself of such a corrupt benefit in return for not reporting the manner and operation of the illegal brothel.

9Sequence 2
During the period 1 February 2009 - 30 September 2010 the offender corruptly received restaurant meals, gift cards for use at stores in the acquisition of liquor, groceries and petrol. The value of these corrupt benefits is identified by the Crown as being in the order of $750. In return the offender wrote a Report on behalf of the developer, David Tasker for submission to Council supporting approval to reduced ceiling heights in a development. He disguised the fact that he was the true author of the report. 

10Sequence 3
Between March 2010 and September 2010 the offender accepted a number of expensive meals at a variety of restaurants from a group called ""Red Chilli Restaurant Group"". He also accepted a gift of an expensive bottle of wine and an expensive fountain pen. In return he prepared a report to assist the group in setting up a restaurant in Chatswood, wrote letters on their behalf to the Department of Immigration supporting a visa for the chef at the Red Chilli Restaurant, involved himself in the development of the restaurant's wine list and put pressure on a slip floor assessor to pass the restaurant as having safe floor surfaces. 

The monetary value of offender's importuning for corrupt benefits is calculated by the Crown as equalling $2,750, including a sum of over $2,300 alone spent on a lunch at a restaurant. Telephone intercepts clearly confirm the offender knew the unacceptability and corrupt nature of his conduct.

11Sequence 4 
Between April 2010 and September 2010 the offender formed a relationship with a developer by the name of Sam Koura and with other persons identified as Geroulis and Sanho. By reason of that relationship the offender would access the files of other council officers and extract information about objections to proposed developments, including the personal identifiers and addresses of objectors. This was in breach of council procedures. In return Mr Koura provided the offender with benefits including sexual services at brothels, alcohol, meals, a signed football jersey and seating at a football corporate box. 

12Form 1 matter
The offender received food and wine from a Mr Anthony Debeck, a slip floor assessor, in return for recommending clients to Mr Debeck. This is the same individual identified as being involved in the assessment of the Red Chilli Restaurant in sequence 3 who was pressured by the offender to pass the floor of the restaurant as satisfactory.

13Sequences 6 & 7
The offender acknowledges that on 6 July 2010 and 16 August 2010 he made claims for overtime worked on behalf of the council when in reality he was attending the Oriana Bath House illegal brothel receiving free sexual services. The amount fraudulently claimed is not quantified however the Court accepts it would not have been significant.

The Plea
14Despite the fact that the offender acknowledged his conduct during the proceedings before the ICAC he did not formally enter a plea to these charges until 15 June 2012, some 4 months after the first return date before the Court.

15Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 establishes that a court may take a plea of guilty into account in mitigation of penalty. Based on these provisions and the guideline judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 I come to the view the offender is entitled to mitigate the penalty by reason of the utilitarian value of his plea. I do not agree however that his plea is an early plea. 

16In arriving at this conclusion I have regard to the principles of general application set out in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. I do not lose sight of the fact that despite the reality that the offender knew of his guilt he waited until the prosecution prepared and served a brief of evidence upon him. Taking the foregoing into account I allow a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of 15%.

17In addition to this factor the offender is entitled to rely on the relevant provisions of section 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His character, attested to in references tendered on his behalf, lack of prior antecedents and what I accept to be genuine contrition and remorse are to be applied in his favour. 

Subjective factors
18The offender is aged 39 years old. He has no prior convictions. He is currently married and has two children. It is a trite observation to make that he was dismissed from his position with Willoughby Council following the disclosure of his criminal conduct however he has managed to secure further employment. The Court has been told his current employer is aware of these proceedings. Prior to his employment with Willoughby Council the offender had a period of employment with other Local Government bodies. 

19The offender gave evidence under oath before the Court. He affirmed the accuracy of the prosecution facts and expressed remorse in relation to his conduct. He says, unsurprisingly, that his behaviour has had an adverse impact on his relationship with his wife and that this relationship may not last. He informed the Court that media attention had led to adverse consequences for his two children at school where other pupils had taunted them.

20The offender seeks to apportion part of the responsibility for his conduct on a lack of proper systems within Council. I will return to this self-serving sophistry later.

21The prosecution took issue with a number of the submissions made on behalf of the offender. Mr Stainer for the DPP also tendered the decision of the District Court in R v Fryar (unreported, Charteris DCJ, 12 March 2010, 2009/7836) on the approach taken in that jurisdiction. The circumstances in that case are similar to the matter before me. It is conceded however they are more serious. Nevertheless the views expressed by the District Court in that matter accord with the view of this Court. 

22For reasons to do with section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to the need for denunciation, general and particular deterrence it is pertinent to repeat the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Retsos v R [2006] NSWCCA 85 at [31]:

The corrupt conduct of a public official is not a trifling offence. Any offence of or ancillary to corrupt conduct on the part of any public official should be denounced plainly and punished condignly.

23These guiding principles need to be considered in the context of the submissions by the offender's counsel to the effect that the offences are towards the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. I agree that this is the case with the fraud offences. I do not accept the proposition that the corruption matters are minor in nature.

24The fact that there is a two tiered penalty regime depending on the monetary gain from the corrupt conduct is relevant on the question of penalty, not as to the intrinsic nature of corruption itself. To appreciate why this is so the nature and extent of the offender's offending needs to be construed within its proper environment.

25The offender was, at the time of the offences, a Building Inspector employed by Willoughby Council. As a member of staff within the Council he was, as was conceded in the body of the statement of facts, a decision maker and an employee bound by the Council's Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct of Willoughby Council was adopted in 1994, updated in 2005, 2008 and, importantly so far as the offender is concerned, in February 2009. 

26I make these historical observations at this point because it is important to rebut the offender's attempt to lay partial responsibility for his offending on the internal procedures of Council. Whilst Chapter 7 of the ICAC findings seeks to qualify the environment in which council officers found themselves as lacking in coherence and direction in my view such findings are exceedingly generous. I reject the offender's attempts to mitigate his conduct by reference to these findings. They are not binding on this Court and do not accord with the concept of personal accountability to behave ethically irrespective of a capacity on the part of an employer to conduct programmes of education on ethical behaviour or develop effective internal controls and oversights. Whether Council employed him or not it is disingenuous to assert that the offender does not know the difference between right and wrong. 

27Episodic corruption within the wider community and within Local Councils is hardly a novelty. In recent years there have been a number of examples of such criminal behaviour. Many have attracted extensive attention by the media to the extent that the nature and unacceptability of such conduct and its consequences has frequently been published for the information of the wider community.

28The nature of the offender's conduct was such that he had to know the intrinsically corrupt nature of it. What else do the words ""I can do this, I work for the council, I can break the law"" in the penultimate paragraph of page 9 of the facts or ""you made me a monster I never used to go to brothels. Now I go to them fuckin weekly"" and in response to his audience's statement ""and someone else pays for them all the time - yeah that's right I don't think I've ever paid"" in the last paragraph on page 10 of the agreed facts mean? They mean the offender knew with absolute certainty what he was doing but proceeded nonetheless.

29On any objective assessment the offender was under no illusion that his obligations lay to his employer and the community and not to himself. 

30Part 2 of the Code of Conduct Staff Edition sets out in clear and unequivocal fashion what was expected of him. Part 3 highlights and expands upon those expectations in a practical fashion and Part 5 tellingly describes the circumstances relating to Gifts and Benefits that differentiate between the token and the unacceptable. As indicated earlier, the Code of conduct had been extant since 1994 and regularly updated. The proper conclusion an independent observer would make of the offender's conduct is that it was patently and deliberately undertaken in defiance of the clear rules of engagement between the offender and the wider community with disregard for the trust reposed in him by his employer.

31The fact that the monetary value put on the acts of corruption by the prosecution is relatively small does not trivialise or mitigate the fundamental nature of corruption. As indicated earlier, the quantum of the benefit goes to the question of the maximum jurisdictional legislative penalty. It does not mitigate the essential nature of corruption as a blight on the community.

32The offender willingly and knowingly engaged in conduct that enabled illegal activity to continue, connived in undertaking work on behalf of people that he believed would effectively circumvent due process, secretly compromised the privacy of individual residents by disclosing their details to a third party and perpetuated the belief in the minds of others involved in the range of conduct disclosed within the facts that those who work within Local Government, the third tier of government in this State, are amenable to manipulation for illicit purposes.

33His conduct strikes at the very heart of public confidence in proper and transparent process. It creates or reinforces the public perspective that the operations and decision-making exercises of Councils and thus government in general may not be conducted in an entirely honest and professional manner. It does not take too much thought to understand that at the level of local government there will be some members of a local community who object to a proposal only to find that their objections do not carry the day. They may conclude that what was in reality an honest decision is tinged with corruption because they are aware that in the past people, such as this offender and others, have conducted themselves in a corrupt manner to influence the outcome of applications to Councils. Such are the unfortunate consequences of corruption. The innocent become tainted by the criminality of the corrupt. Sadly the perception reinforced by the offender's conduct is likely to be enduring.

34As stated earlier the objective seriousness of corruption is not to be determined solely on the basis of a mathematical correlation between the monetary values of the benefit flowing to the offender. That is only part of the consideration. It is not beyond contemplation that depending on the circumstances, a corrupt public official may sell their corruption cheaply or a corrupting influence may be overly generous in the nature of the temptation. What is important is that neither the Court nor the community lose sight of the fact that all corruption has to start somewhere. What flows from it may aggravate the initial conduct but the mathematical quantification of a financial advantage or benefit does not detract from the essence of the egregious nature of the original decision to enter into corrupt conduct. 

35Viewed from the other end of the spectrum, namely those who seek to encourage corrupt conduct, the principled approach taken by Courts is comparable to that identified as appropriate for those who engage in corruption as the recipient or beneficiary. Although the observations are generally made in respect of the bribing of police officers they remain apposite to the factual circumstances before me.

36In R v O'Mally [2005] NSWCCA 166 at [15]-[16] the Court cited the comments in R v Nomchong (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 April 1997) with approval. In that matter the Court said:

The police are in a position of authority and trust in the community and the public depends on them to uphold the rule of law. The crime of bribery by a police officer is one that strikes at the very heart of the justice system.

37In R v Pangallo (1991) 56 A Crim R 441 at 443 the Court said:

In my view the crime of bribery is always to be regarded as one which strikes at the very heart of the justice system and it must be severely punished whenever it is detected.

38And in R v Duong (1999) 109 A Crim R 60 at [27] Wood CJ at CL said:

The offence of bribery or offering a bribe to police in the course of the execution of their duties is a most serious offence.. Save in the most exceptional circumstances it will call for a significant term of imprisonment to be imposed...

39Substitute ""officer of local government for police officer and view such conduct from the perspective of sections 439-440 and the Code of Conduct set out in Schedule 6A of the Local Government Act 1993 and the community will readily understand that they are entitled to expect the highest standards of those employed on their behalf.

40Turning to the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 it is clear that general and particular deterrence are of paramount importance in dealing with offences of this nature. The overriding need for emphasis on general deterrence can result, as it does in this case, in lessening the weight that might otherwise be given to prior good character. As was noted in R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527, less weight may be attributed where the prior good character of the offender has enabled the offender to gain a position where the particular offence can be committed.

41Having taken the foregoing into account and weighing the balance those factors identified in section 21(3) of the Act that mitigate penalty, such as lack of prior antecedents, accepted contrition and remorse and the utilitarian value of the plea I come to the view in relation to the corruption offences that, despite the admonition set out in section 5 of the Act, the offender's conduct warrants the imposition of sentences of imprisonment. 

42After taking the Form 1 matter into account as aggravating the charges upon which the offender is to be sentenced and following application of the discount of 15% the offender is convicted on each of the corruption offences and sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months. Given the interrelationship between each act of corruption such sentences and the need to have regard to the principle of totality the sentences are to be served concurrently. 

43Having determined the sentences in each of the corruption matters it remains to decide the manner in which the sentences are to be served. In determining this aspect I have taken a number of factors into account. Suspending execution of the sentence is inconsistent with achieving general deterrence. So much is made made clear in R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442. On the other side of the balancing exercise the defendant has not been previously imprisoned. He has good prospects of rehabilitation. He is currently in employment. He has two young children to support. His wife is only employed part time and her income could not support the current mortgage repayments and maintain the family during the period of his incarceration. Whilst hardship to family members is not of itself relevant on the issue of special circumstances it is relevant in my view in determining the manner in which a sentence is to be served.

44In addition to the foregoing there is an added consideration that is pertinent on the issue of sentence. During the currency of sentencing submissions the Court sought information from the DPP on the state at which proceedings against those who provided bribes to the defendant had reached. This was done so that any issues relating to parity could be properly taken into account. In response the Solicitor for the DPP informed the Court that there was to be no prosecution brought against any of the persons involved in operating the illegal brothel, nor against the proprietors of the Red Chilli restaurant, nor against David Tasker of the Bennelong Group, nor property developer Sam Koura nor Anthony Debeck. 

45The Solicitor for the DPP was unable to tell the Court why that should be the case. There may be good reasons why only the offender has been prosecuted. Whatever they may be the offender is entitled to feel a sense of disenchantment that only he has been the subject of prosecution.

46For the foregoing reasons I have come to the view therefore that, subject to a suitability assessment by Probation and Parole, the appropriate manner in which the sentences of imprisonment ought be served is by way of Home Detention. The proceedings will be adjourned until 6 September 2012 to enable the assessment to be undertaken. The offender is to report to Probation and Parole forthwith. A copy of the agreed statement of facts and my remarks is to be provided to Probation and Parole to assist in the assessment process.

47Turning to the two counts of fraud, I repeat my remarks that the financial gain to the offender would not of itself warrant condign punishment. The offender's conduct however remains a breach of trust and should be regarded seriously. The offender's prior good record and the utilitarian value of the plea however justify a more lenient outcome, one that addresses general and particular deterrence and reinforces the need for the offender's rehabilitation. For each of those two offences the offender is convicted. He is released under the provisions of section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years and to appear before this Court if called upon during that time.

		15 August 2012",2012-07-25 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2707931,DS v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 159,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 17 September 2009, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of the following offences:
Count 1:  that, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2), the appellant, between 1 July 1999 and 31 May 2000 assaulted TP and at the time of that assault, committed an act of indecency upon TP, who was then under 10 years of age, namely, 4 or 5 years of age.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment.
Count 2:  that, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 61O(2), the appellant, between 1 July 1999 and 31 May 2000 incited TP, who was then under 10 years of age, namely, 4 or 5 years of age, to commit an act of indecency upon him.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 7 years imprisonment.
Count 3:  that, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 61M(2), the appellant, between 1 February 2003 and 14 September 2003, assaulted TP and at the time committed an act of indecency upon TP, who was then under 10 years of age, namely, 8 or 9 years of age.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 5 years is prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999:  see Table to Pt 4, Div 1A.
Count 5:  that, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 66EA(1) the appellant, between 25 July 2004 and 17 July 2007, engaged in conduct in relation to TP who was then a child under 18 years of age.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act:  see Table to Pt 4, Div 1A.  
2The jury returned a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 4, which alleged a contravention of the Crimes Act, s 66A.  
3The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a total effective non-parole period of 9 years 9 months commencing on 20 May 2009 to expire on 19 February 2019 and a total additional term of 3 years 3 months expiring on 19 May 2022.  
4The appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence.  
The conviction appeal
5The appellant raised the following four grounds on his conviction appeal:
Ground 1: The trial of the appellant was not held according to law and was thus a nullity;
Ground 2: The Crown Prosecutor's address gave rise to a miscarriage of justice insofar as the address invited the jury to ask the question ""why would the complainant lie?"" in order to promote the acceptance of the complainant as a witness of truth.
Ground 3: The trial judge erred:
(a) in directing the jury as to ""why would the complainant lie?""(b) by failing to give a proper and/or adequate warning to the jury as to the unreliability of evidence of admissions;
Ground 4: Generally, there has been a miscarriage of justice.
Factual background
6The appellant and the complainant's mother commenced a relationship in about 1998.  At that time, the complainant was 4 years of age.  The appellant and the complainant's mother had two children during the course of their relationship, the first born in 2001 and the second in 2002.  The complainant's mother worked full-time as a nurse and the appellant looked after the complainant and, after their birth, the two children of the relationship, whilst she was at work.  The relationship ended in early 2003.  
7The Crown case was that the appellant's offending conduct occurred over an extensive period from mid-1999 when the complainant was aged about 5 years until mid-2007, when the complainant was aged 13 years.  The Crown contended that the offending conduct extended beyond the period of the relationship, as arrangements were in place for the purpose of the appellant having contact with his children.  The appellant attended the house where the family was living for this purpose and, on occasions, drove the children to and from karate classes.  The Crown case was that, at times, the appellant drove the complainant to these classes on her own.
The complainant's evidence and description of the offending conduct
8The complainant gave three records of interview to the police:  17 October 2003, 20 July 2007 and 17 March 2009.  Over the three records of interview, the complainant provided information to the police upon which the charges against the appellant were based.  She gave a detailed description of what occurred on these occasions. The incidents constituting each of the charges of which the appellant was found guilty may be summarised as follows.  
9The conduct upon which count 1 was based occurred between 1 July 1999 and 31 May 2000 when the appellant placed his finger on the outside of the complainant's vagina.  The complainant said, ""I think he rubbed it"".  The conduct occurred when she was living at Bligh Park when she was about 5 years of age, prior to the birth of her other two siblings, and the appellant was minding her whilst her mother was at work.  The appellant told the complainant not to tell her mother. 
10The conduct upon which count 2 was based occurred between the same dates, also at the complainant's home at Bligh Park.  The appellant put oil on the complainant's hand and had her rub his penis.  The complainant was aged about 5 at this time and the conduct occurred before her siblings were born.  
11The conduct upon which count 3 was based occurred between 1 February 2003 and 14 September 2003 when the appellant placed his finger on the complainant's vagina and ""rubbed it ... with his finger [for] about 10 seconds ... under [the complainant's] undies"".  The complainant had been playing on the computer and the appellant showed her how to get onto the internet.  The complainant was aged about 8-9 years of age at this time and was living at St Clair.  Again, he told the complainant not to tell her mother.
12The conduct upon which count 5 was based involved five specific incidences of sexual abuse during the period 25 July 2004 and 17 July 2007, such as to constitute persistent sexual abuse of a child under the age of 18 within the meaning of the Crimes Act, s 66EA.  The complainant was aged between 10 and 13 years of age at this time.
13The five incidents were as follows:
(1) The appellant had taken the complainant to a park at Penrith to play.  On the way home the appellant stopped the car and started touching the complainant and put his finger in the complainant's vagina;
(2) On a trip home from the shops, the appellant put two fingers in the complainant's vagina;
(3) Whilst driving the complainant to karate, the appellant pulled out his penis and caused the complainant's hand to touch it;
(4) Whilst driving home from karate, the appellant put his finger in the complainant's vagina;
(5) On another occasion whilst driving to karate, the appellant put two fingers in the complainant's vagina. 
Evidence of KP
14KP is the complainant's mother.  It is convenient in the first instance to refer to KP's evidence for the purpose of establishing where the family was living at particular points of time.  From about the end of 1999 until about May 2000, KP and the complainant were living at Bligh Park.  KP was then in a relationship with the appellant, but they were not living together on a full-time basis.  KP and the complainant then moved to Erskine Park where they lived until February 2002.  The appellant lived with them and it was whilst they were living there that the two children of KP's relationship with the appellant were born.  
15In about late 2002 or early 2003, KP and the appellant moved to St Clair with the children.  KP and the children returned to live at Erskine Park within about two weeks without the appellant.
16KP gave evidence that she was working both day and night shifts of 12 hours during this time.  The appellant frequently looked after the complainant and, following the birth of the two children of the relationship, all three children.  On occasions, a friend looked after the complainant.
17KP stated that in September 2003, the complainant told her something, as a result of which she requested LE to speak to the complainant.  LE was a family friend and the mother of the complainant's cousin.  KP said LE and the complainant went outside, where they remained for about an hour.  She said that when LE and the complainant came back inside, LE told her that the appellant had ""been doing inappropriate things"" to the complainant.  KP then rang the police.
18KP said that the following day, LE had taken the complainant out and later, after having dropped her home, LE telephoned KP.  KP said that LE was in tears and told her that the complainant ""had described with a stick the size of [the appellant's] penis and that ... he put his fingers in her"".
19KP said that she then made further contact with the police and on 7 October 2003, she received a telephone call from the Joint Investigation Response Team (JIRT) and an arrangement was made for the complainant to be interviewed.  KP said she was informed that as a result of the interview, the appellant would not be charged, because the complainant had not made any disclosure, but that the case would be left open.  However, an AVO was made against the appellant identifying the complainant as the person in need of protection and citing that the complainant had told a friend that the appellant had been sexually assaulting her, the last occasion being seven months previously.  An interim order was obtained on 8 September 2003 and a final order made on 28 October 2003.  The appellant did not contest the AVO.
20KP said that there were informal arrangements in relation to the appellant's contact with his children.  Initially, those arrangements involved KP taking the children to the appellant's parents' home on a Friday afternoon and the appellant's parents returning the children on a Sunday afternoon.  She said that over time, the appellant began accompanying the parents when the children were returned and that eventually, the appellant began bringing the children back personally.  She said that as a result of that he commenced spending time at the home where she and the children, including the complainant, were then living.
21KP gave evidence that the complainant, one of the complainant's siblings and a cousin commenced karate lessons on 19 April 2005.  The karate lessons continued until sometime in January 2007.  The appellant was coming to the home at this time to visit his children.  KP said that she and her mother would drive the children to and from karate, but the appellant also often drove them.  She said on occasions the appellant drove the complainant alone.
22KP also gave evidence that on 27 March 2007, she received a telephone call from LT, whom she knew was then living with the appellant.  She said LT ""was hysterical, crying"".  LT said to ""please not let [the complainant] go to the Easter Show"" with the appellant.
23KP met with LT the following morning.  LT asked her whether ""stuff had happened with [the complainant]"".  KP told her that ""nothing was proven"".  KP said that LT then said ""[w]ell he confessed everything that he's done and what he wanted to do to [the complainant]"".  KP said that she ""went straight home and contacted DOCS"".  As she received no response and despite a follow-up telephone call, KP wrote to the Police Minister and to her local member, complaining about the previous investigation.  In July 2007 she was contacted by an officer from JIRT and arrangements were made for the complainant to be interviewed.
24KP accepted that her relationship with the appellant was ""volatile ... on and off"".  She agreed in cross-examination that she had a ""very bad break up"" with the appellant in 2003 and that in September 2003 (""possibly September""), she wanted him out of the house.  KP denied that just after the break up she had become aware that the appellant had made allegations about her to Centrelink and the ANZ Bank.  She agreed that she took the complainant ""to see JIRT"" for the first time in October 2003, but denied she told the complainant what to say to the police.  It is convenient to note that the complainant denied in cross-examination that her mother told her what to say in her record of interview.  KP also disagreed that she had told the complainant what to say in the complainant's interviews with the police in July 2007 and March 2009.  
25KP rejected that she had been motivated to have the complainant and LT fabricate their evidence out of malice towards the appellant following their break up.
Evidence of LE
26In about September 2003, LE had a conversation with the complainant.  LE initiated the conversation after the complainant's mother requested her to speak to the complainant.  The conversation between LE and the complainant took place in the garden at the complainant's home.
27LE said that after some general conversation, she asked the complainant if ""something had happened to her"".  The complainant told her that the appellant ""had touched her private parts"".  LE said that the complainant ""pointed to her lower region"" when she said this.  The complainant told her that the appellant ""had put oil on her hands and made him touch his penis and that he had rubbed her vagina"".  The complainant said that this had occurred at Bligh Park in the appellant's room.  LE said that whilst the complainant was telling her this, ""she was pulling plants and things ... out of the garden, she was fiddling with her hands a lot, she seemed agitated"".
28LE spoke to the complainant again the following day.  On that occasion, LE had taken the complainant for an outing to see LE's horses.  Whilst they were out in a paddock LE asked the complainant whether she wanted to report the matter ""to somebody important"" or whether she just wanted LE to be there for her to talk to.  The complainant said that she wanted LE ""to tell somebody important"".
29LE said that on this occasion, she asked the complainant when was the last time that the complainant had touched her.  The complainant said that it was at the house at St Clair while the appellant was at the computer and she was beside him.  The complainant said that the appellant had ""touched her on her private parts while he was staring at her"".
30LE also had a discussion on that occasion with the complainant as to the size of the appellant's penis.  LE said that the complainant picked up a stick and said ""This is the size of [the appellant's] penis"".  LE said the stick was ""seven or eight inches"" long. 
31LE made a report to DOCS shortly after this conversation. 
32In cross-examination, the appellant's defence counsel asked a series of questions about where the complainant's mother and children were living at particular times.  He also confirmed that before LE spoke to the complainant, the complainant's mother had told her the appellant had sexually abused the complainant.  It was not suggested to LE in cross-examination that the conversations between her and the complainant had not occurred.  Nor was it suggested that LE's account of those conversations was in any way inaccurate.  
Evidence of CP, the complainant's grandmother
33The complainant's grandmother gave evidence that she was doing both karate and kickboxing at the same academy as the complainant and the other grandchildren were training.  She said that the children were going to the academy on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Both she and the complainant's mother shared driving the children to the academy.  
34She also said she ""quite regularly"" saw the appellant at karate and that she had seen him drive the complainant alone to and from karate.  She said that on some occasions, he would also drive the other children home from karate with the complainant.  In cross-examination, CP was challenged as to her evidence that the appellant had driven the complainant alone to and from karate.  She was also challenged that the appellant had only taken the children to karate a few times, it being suggested that it was five times or less.  CP rejected these challenges and confirmed her evidence that the appellant had driven the complainant on her own.
Evidence of LT 
35LT was the appellant's partner in 2007.  She had had a previous relationship with him in 2004.  
36LT said that on occasions when she and the appellant were having sex, the appellant would say things like ""Wouldn't you like to watch me have sex with [the complainant]?"" and ""get [the complainant] to basically have oral sex with me"".  She said that the appellant used the complainant's name when he made these comments.  LT said that initially, when the appellant made such statements, she didn't know to whom he was referring.  We will refer to this as the first admission.
37In February or March 2007, LT had expressed an opinion to DH, a friend of the appellant, that she thought KP was being difficult about the appellant seeing his children.  DH told LT that KP had taken the appellant ""to court before about him touching the kids"".  LT said that later that day, the appellant had brought the subject up and said ""It wasn't actually [the appellant's children] that [DH] was talking about.  It was [the complainant] ... And it was true"".  We will refer to this as the second admission.
38LT said the appellant told her about instances where he had taken the complainant to kickboxing and ""he'd get her to touch him and he'd touch her"".  He told her that the complainant would touch his penis and he would touch her ""vagina area"".  We will refer to this as the third admission.
39She said the appellant spoke of another instance when the complainant was younger and couldn't turn on a tap in the bathroom when she was having a shower.  She said that the appellant told her that when he helped her, ""he used to get her to touch him on his penis"".  We will refer to this as the fourth admission.
40LT also said that in the early part of 2007 she would drive to KP's home with the appellant when he was taking the children home as he had lost his licence.  She said that he wasn't allowed to enter the premises and he would take the children to the gate.  LT said the complainant met the children at the gate and she saw the appellant talking to the complainant and whilst doing so, ""put ... his right hand down the front of his pants"".  We will refer to this as the fifth admission.
41LT said she had another conversation with the appellant in relation to the Easter Show.  She said the original arrangement was that he was going to take his own children, but that the arrangement changed to taking his own children and the complainant.  She said that as the time got closer to the Easter Show, the appellant said to her ""I might speak to [KP] and tell her the kids are a bit hectic at the Easter show and just take [the complainant] and then we have her all to ourselves"".  LT said that when he said this, the appellant ""grunted and he thinks it's funny like"".  We will refer to this as the sixth admission.
42LT said that she ""kicked [the appellant] out a couple of days later"".  She said that she rang KP and told her ""not to send the kids to the Easter show with [the appellant]"".  
43LT made a statement to JIRT.  
44LT's credit was attacked in cross-examination.  She had a criminal history for a range of offences, including offences of dishonesty.  However, she rejected the assertion that her evidence was concocted as retribution for the acrimonious breakdown of her relationship with the appellant.
The appellant's evidence
45The appellant gave evidence at the trial.  He denied each of the charges.  
46He said that after his relationship with the complainant's mother ended in March 2003, he had made complaints about her to DOCS, Telstra and the ANZ Bank.  He reported her to Centrelink ""at a little bit later date"".  His evidence was that the complaints were:
""... about things that [the complainant's mother] had done [to him] ... [i]n relation to each of those different departments and organisations.""  
47The appellant said that he complained to DOCS in April 2003, to Telstra and the ANZ Bank in September 2003 and to Centrelink ""towards the end of 2003"".  He said that at the end of the October 2003, he informed the complainant's mother by text message that he had made these complaints.  However, from her responses, he believed that the complainant's mother already knew about the complaints to the ANZ Bank and Telstra.  The appellant denied that he had only made these complaints to ""[get] in first"", because he was concerned that the complainant would report the sexual offences to her mother.
48The appellant denied the substance of LT's evidence.  He also denied speaking to her about possible charges against him instigated by KP in relation to the complainant.  He denied putting his hand inside his pants whilst talking to the complainant when returning his children on 25 March 2007.
49He said that he had consented to a final order for the AVO because ""it was easier"".  He said that he did not have a lawyer at the time.  He acknowledged that the AVO related to complaints of sexual assault, but said that the AVO did not restrict his contact with his own children, nor did it restrict his contact with the complainant.
50He said that after the AVO was made, he only took the complainant out on her own twice.  The first was to Australia's Wonderland in late 2004 and the second occasion was to the Royal Easter Show in 2006.  He denied that he took the complainant to a kids club at Penrith or to sporting fields at Penrith on her own.  He agreed that he had driven the children home from karate but said this had occurred on about five occasions.  He denied that he had driven the complainant on her own to or from karate.
Ground 1:  that the trial of the appellant was not held according to law and was thus a nullity
51The basis for that ground was the contention that the appellant was not arraigned in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 130(3)(b).  It is necessary to explain the context in which that was said to be the case. 
52The appellant's trial was listed to commence on 7 September 2009 (a Monday).  The trial judge (Syme DCJ) had previously been informed that there were legal issues to be determined before a trial with a jury could proceed.  Accordingly, a jury panel was not summoned for that day.  
53At the outset of the proceedings, the Crown presented an indictment containing five counts and the appellant was arraigned on that indictment (the transcript records his having pleaded guilty to the fifth count but that is plainly an error).  The proceedings were then adjourned to the following day, when the judge proceeded to hear and determine the legal issues.  
54In taking that course, her Honour was exercising the jurisdiction conferred by the Criminal Procedure Act, s 130(2) which provides (in respect of the Supreme Court and the District Court):
""(2) The court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial.""
55On the following day (the Wednesday), having given her rulings as to the legal issues, the trial judge empanelled a jury.  The process by which that occurred was unexceptionable. The jury panel was brought into court.  The Crown presented the indictment (evidently the same indictment as had been presented on the Monday).  The appellant was arraigned on that indictment in the presence of the whole jury panel, as customarily occurs at the outset of a trial.  He pleaded not guilty to all five counts.  After taking the steps required under the Jury Act 1977, s 38(7), the trial judge then empanelled a jury.
56Following the empanelment, the judge's associate placed the appellant in the jury's charge.  In doing so, the associate did not read the charges again in full, referring to them globally as ""the charges on the arraignment"".
57At the conclusion of the process, the Crown inquired whether it was the judge's practice not to re-arraign the accused ""once the jury panel has been chosen"".  The judge evidently understood the question to refer to the process of placing the accused in the jury's charge, and the discussion that followed accordingly suffered from some confusion.  In any event, it was made clear at the appeal in this Court that no point was taken in respect of the process by which the accused was placed in the jury's charge.
58The appellant's only complaint as to the empanelment process is that he was not arraigned again after the jury had been empanelled.  That was evidently the point the Crown was attempting to raise at the time.  
59The Crown told the judge that there are different practices as to whether to re-arraign the accused person following the empanelment of a jury.  Assuming that is so, the Court is not aware of any requirement to re-arraign an accused person after empanelment and we can see no purpose or utility in doing so.
60It was acknowledged on behalf of the appellant that there would have been no requirement to re-arraign after empanelment had the trial proceeded with a jury on the Monday.  However, it was submitted that there is a mandatory requirement to do so when a judge exercises jurisdiction under s 130(2).  The requirement was said to derive from s 130(3) of the Act, which provides:
""(3) If proceedings are held for the purpose of making any such orders after the indictment is presented to commence the trial and before the jury is empanelled: (a) the proceedings are part of the trial of the accused person, and(b) the accused person is to be arraigned again on the indictment when the jury is empanelled for the continuation of the trial.""
61Mr Lowe, who appeared for the appellant, submitted that the phrase ""when the jury is empanelled"" on its proper construction means ""after the jury is empanelled"".  In support of the contention that ""when"" means ""after"" in that context, he relied upon the definition of ""when"" in the Oxford Dictionary of English, 3rd ed, which notes that ""when"" used as a conjunction includes the following meaning:
""after which; and just then (implying suddenness): he had just drifted off to sleep when the phone rang.""
62There is no force in that contention.  The clear purpose of the Criminal Procedure Act, s 130 is to permit the trial judge to hear and determine legal issues as part of the trial without the need first to empanel a jury.  The vice to which that provision was directed was the inconvenience and expense of having a jury empanelled only to be sent away, sometimes for days or even weeks, while legal issues were determined that would inform the way in which the trial could be conducted (or indeed whether it could be conducted at all).
63The object of s 130(3) is to ensure that the accused, having been arraigned before the judge alone for the purpose of enlivening the court's jurisdiction under s 130(2), is arraigned again in the presence of the jury panel before the trial continues.  It makes sense to impose such a requirement, since it merely ensures that the procedure upon empanelment is no different by reason of the court having adopted the procedure allowed under s 130(2). 
64Nothing in the language of the statute or the nature of the processes addressed in s 130 commends the construction contended for by the appellant.  Arraignment is undertaken in the presence of the whole panel because that is the formal step that brings the accused to trial.  An accused person must be arraigned as the first step because the plea determines the course of the trial (including whether a jury is required at all). 
65There is no purpose or utility in a second arraignment after empanelment in that circumstance.  There is no practical advantage to an accused person in being arraigned a second time, and no disadvantage if he or she is not, having been arraigned usually only moments earlier in the presence of the jury panel.  As acknowledged on behalf of the appellant, there is no requirement for a second arraignment in the circumstance where there is no legal issue to be determined in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction under s 130(2).
66The Court rejects ground 1. 
Grounds 2 and 3(a):  the ""why would the complainant lie?"" issue
67Grounds 2 and 3(a) are conveniently dealt with together, as they both relate to the treatment of the complainant's response ""Why would I lie about that?  I have no reason to lie"" to a question asked of her in cross-examination.  In dealing with this question, it is convenient first to refer to the evidence and the context in which it was given and then to deal with the case law before determining whether the appellant has established appealable error arising from the comments made by the Crown Prosecutor to the jury and from her Honour's directions to the jury. 
68The complainant had been cross-examined in respect of the deteriorating relationship between the appellant and the complainant's mother in 2003.  This was also taken up with the complainant's mother.  It was suggested to her in cross-examination that she had put the complainant up to making allegations against the appellant which were false, in retribution for the breakdown of the relationship with the appellant.  The complainant agreed that her mother did not like the appellant at that time.
69The complainant was then asked: 
""Q.  I'm going to ask you some questions now and I'm going to ask you whether you agree with what I'm saying or you don't agree.  Do you understand that?A.  Yes
Q.  [The appellant] never touched you in a sexual way?A.  I don't agree.
Q.  [The appellant] never put his finger in your vagina?A.  I don't agree.  
Q.  [The appellant] never touched you on your vagina?A.  I don't agree.
Q.  [The appellant] never made you touch him?A.  I don't agree.
Q.  And the information that you've made and you've given in your three interviews, you were lying about what [the appellant] had done to you weren't you?A.  Why would I lie about that?  I have no reason to lie.""  (emphasis added) 
70Immediately following the last question, the trial judge suggested that there be a pause and asked the complainant whether she would like to ""take some time"".  The transcript records the complainant as saying ""No"", but her Honour asked, ""Was that a yes?"", to which ""No verbal reply"" was recorded on the transcript.  The closed circuit television was then deactivated.  
71At that point, defence counsel informed her Honour that was the conclusion of the cross-examination of the complainant.
The case law
72There is a clear line of authority, both in the High Court and in this Court, relating to the prohibition on suggesting to the jury that they might consider the rhetorical question ""why would the complainant lie"" in determining the guilt or innocence of an accused person.  The appellant relied on that line of authority and, in particular, the decision of this Court in Doe v R [2008] NSWCCA 203; 187 A Crim R 328, where the authorities were summarised.  The appellant contended that these authorities supported his argument that the Crown Prosecutor's comment to the jury relating to the complainant's answer was impermissible and that her Honour gave an inadequate direction to the jury in respect of that part of the complainant's evidence.   
73In Doe the Court was concerned with comments made to the jury by the Crown Prosecutor that the principal Crown witness ""had no axe to grind"".  It was argued that this was equivalent to posing the rhetorical question ""why would the complainant lie?"" and thus as giving rise to:
""... the risk that, in the search for an explanation for why false allegations might be made against the accused, the onus of proof is transferred from the Crown to the accused.""  (per Latham J at [21], 335)
74Latham J (Spigelman CJ and Hidden J agreeing) summarised the effect of the authorities on this issue as follows:
""59 Where there is no direct evidence of a motive to lie on the part of a central Crown witness, or evidence from which one can be reasonably inferred, a miscarriage of justice may be occasioned by:- 
(i) cross-examination of an accused as to the reasons why the witness would make the allegations that are central to proof of the Crown case; (ii) a Crown submission to the jury that draws attention to the fact that the defence case did not, by cross-examination of the witness, advance a motive to lie;(iii) a Crown submission to the jury which directly invites them to ask the question 'Why would he/she lie?' in order to promote the acceptance of the witness as a witness of truth;(iv) a summing up that endorses or approves or fails to qualify a Crown submission falling within (ii) or (iii), or contains directions to the same effect. 
60 Ultimately, whether the conduct outlined in (i), (ii) or (iii) leaves the jury with the impression that the accused bears some onus of proving the existence of a motive for the fabrication of the allegations against him/her, falls to be determined on the strength of the directions in the summing up. Full, firm and clear directions on the onus of proof, including a direction that the accused bears no onus to prove a motive to lie, may be sufficient to correct such a misapprehension. Much depends upon the particular circumstances of the case.""
75This case does not fall directly within the factors referred to in (i)-(iv) above.  Rather, the complainant's evidence was given spontaneously in response to an assertion put to her in cross-examination that she was lying.  Accordingly, it is necessary to look behind the summary in Doe to the principal authorities from which the principles stated were derived.  In this regard, it is sufficient to consider the statements of principle in R v Uhrig (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 October 1996, unreported);  R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520;  98 A Crim R 1;  and Palmer v R [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1.
76In Uhrig, a distinction was drawn between those cases where there was no evidence of an actual motive to lie, whether directly or inferentially, and those cases where there was such evidence.  The Court (Hunt CJ at CL, Newman and Ireland JJ agreeing), adopting the statement of Sperling J in R v E (1996) 39 NSWLR 450, stated, at 462, that in cases where there was no evidence of motive it was illegitimate to pose the rhetorical question ""why would the complainant lie?"", as it implied its own answer.  As Hunt CJ at CL explained:
""That leads the jury to infer that, there being no apparent reason, there was in fact no reason, and then to conclude that, as there was no reason to lie, the witness must be telling the truth ... In my view, that danger of such illegitimate speculation is a sufficient reason for saying that the rhetorical question should not be raised in such a case."" 
77His Honour pointed out that where there was a motive to lie, either asserted in cross-examination or of which there was direct evidence, that ""is a very relevant factor in assessing the witness' credit"":  see R v F (1994) 83 A Crim R 502.  His Honour then stated:
""What this Court said in Regina v F and in Regina v E should not be interpreted as excluding arguments being put to the jury, by either counsel or the judge, relating to the validity of the motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case.  That is so notwithstanding that there is no requirement for the accused to prove such a motive, although in many such cases where the evidence of that witness is vital to the Crown case it would be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury that, even if they reject the motive to lie put forward by the accused, that does not mean that the witness is necessarily telling the truth, and to emphasize that the Crown must still satisfy them that the witness is telling the truth.  I believe that it is necessary for such a distinction to be stated expressly, in order to avoid skilful advocates attempting to persuade trial judges that a necessary consequence of this Court's decisions in those two cases is that arguments relating to a motive to lie are excluded in every case.  That is not a necessary consequence at all.""  
78The next relevant authority is R v Jovanovic, which bore some similarity to the present case.  In response to a question asked in cross-examination, the complainant answered ""Why would I make up accusations like this if they never really happened?"".  The accused then cross-examined the complainant as to a specific motive she had for fabricating the allegation of sexual assault against the appellant.  The appellant had raised the same motive in his record of interview.  
79The Crown, in address to the jury, said:
""You might wonder why, as this young boy said to you, why would I make these things up? You might wonder why has he got this man in his sights? Why would he accuse him of these terrible things?""  
80The trial judge gave the following direction to the jury in respect of this part of the Crown's address:
""Some argument has been put to you, in the course of the trial, about motivation, although that word has not been precisely used.  Effectively, what has been put is now why would this young man make the allegations he has? A direction I want to put to you and to you quite emphatically is this. That is a reasonable argument to be put to you and, indeed, it would be quite unrealistic to think that you would not yourselves, as members of the community, think about that. You are perfectly entitled to do that, you are perfectly entitled to think about, now why would this young man make the allegations, just as much as you would be entitled to think about, now why would this accused deny them? It would be defying commonsense to think that those considerations would not cross your mind."" 
81On appeal, this direction was held to be inadequate.  Priestley JA (Sperling J agreeing, Cole JA dissenting) held, at 523, that:
""What was said in this paragraph must be tested by reference to the passage from the reasons of Hunt CJ at CL [in Uhrig]. It seems to me to follow from the way the legal position was stated by Hunt CJ at CL that the trial judge, in the above paragraph not only did not bring home to the jury that if they rejected the motive to lie which had been put forward by the appellant that did not mean the complainant was necessarily telling the truth, but also quite clearly left open to them as legitimate the inference that, if the complainant had no motive to lie, they could conclude that because of that alone, he was telling the truth. This created the danger of illegitimate speculation which Hunt CJ at CL in R v Uhrig said led to a miscarriage of justice.
This is sufficient to lead me to the same conclusion in regard to ground 3 of the appeal as that reached by Sperling J. I agree with him also that the correctness of R v E should not be considered in this case. I accept the way in which it was explained in R v Uhrig as correct.""
82Sperling J, at 535, added:
""Neither the reservation in R v E nor the reservation in R v Uhrig detract  from the point that it is not permissible to invite the jury to bolster the complainant's credibility with an argument that there is no apparent reason for the complainant to have lied ...
Neither R v E nor R v Uhrig should be read as justifying an impermissible line of reasoning whenever the quite different question of a particular motive to lie is raised at a trial. That should only have to be stated to be apparent. The existence or non-existence of a particular motive to lie can be debated without inhibition at the trial without contravening the principle that truthfulness is not to be inferred from the absence of any apparent motive to lie.""
83Their Honours thus reiterated what Hunt CJ at CL had said in Uhrig.  
84Palmer was a case where a motive to lie was suggested to the complainant in cross-examination.  The Court's concern was with the prejudicial impact of questions which were then asked of an accused in cross-examination.  The complainant, in response to the question, ""This is some sort of pay back on him for some indiscretion he doesn't even know about, isn't that right?"" answered, ""No, I am not lying"" (see at [6]).  The accused was then cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor as to the lack of any motive the complainant had ""as to why she would make this up"".  Whilst the questioning of the complainant was permissible, the cross-examination of the accused was held to be impermissible.  The majority (Brennan CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) were not satisfied that the trial judge's directions had been adequate to neutralise the prejudicial effect of the cross-examination of the accused.  
85The appellant submitted first that the Crown Prosecutor's address to the jury exacerbated the ""problem with the complainant's evidence"" by his imprudent reference to it.  The appellant further submitted that the effect of the authorities to which reference has been made was that the jury should have been directed that there was no onus on an accused to prove that the complainant had a motive to lie and that if they rejected any suggested motive, they should not thereby infer that the complainant had been telling the truth.  The appellant complained that her Honour's direction covered the second limb, but she had failed to direct the jury on the first limb of this requirement.
86The Crown submitted that in his address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor had permissibly and appropriately drawn the jury's attention to the complainant's shocked reaction to the suggestion that she was lying.  He had done so in a context of having stated to the jury that there was no onus on the appellant to prove anything, including that any witness was lying or had a motive to tell lies against him.  It followed, on the Crown's submission, that there was nothing in the Crown Prosecutor's address that gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.  The Crown submitted that the trial judge's directions were, in any event, adequate.
Crown Prosecutor's address to the jury 
87The complainant's evidence, ""Why would I lie about that?  I have no reason to lie"" was given in the context of cross-examination about her mother's poor relationship with the appellant and in direct response to an allegation that she was lying.  The case is, therefore, one where there was an allegation of a motive to lie, namely, as a form of retribution against the appellant.  The appellant, in fact, submitted that motive to lie became a 'central theme' for the jury's determination.  
88Because motive to lie was an issue, the comments of Hunt CJ at CL in Urhig, referred above at [76]-[77], apply in determining both the appropriateness of the Crown Prosecutor's address to the jury and whether the directions given by the trial judge were adequate in the circumstances. 
89In his address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor referred both to the complainant's answer and her presentation in the witness box at that time.  He said: 
""Just to return to that issue about lying.  It was put by [defence counsel] to the complainant that she was lying when she made these allegations against the accused and you're entitled to consider that proposition.  The Crown says it's clear she was telling the truth.  First thing I'll point to, when it was put to her she said words to the effect of 'Why would I lie about that? I have no reason to lie.'  In the Crown's submission she sounded incredulous.  She sounded shocked that that was what was being put to her.  And that response, that reaction is consistent with a person telling the truth confronted with that sort of question.  And it was a genuine response in the Crown's submission.  And she was genuinely upset about having been called a liar about all of these very serious matters that had happened to her as a child over a number of years and you saw her get upset as a result [of] it.""  (White 572)
90Counsel for the appellant recognised that the complainant's answer had been in response to the cross-examiner's question, ""you were lying"", but submitted the answer was not truly responsive to the question asked.   He pointed out that there was always a danger that such rhetorical evidence had the potential to start a chain of reasoning leading to the acceptance of the appellant's guilt.  He submitted that in this case, the evidence was compounded by the way in which the Crown dealt with the evidence in his address to the jury.  He contended that the Crown Prosecutor's statement was a direct invitation to them to accept the complainant's answer ""Why would I lie?  I have no reason to lie"", so as to promote the acceptance of her as a witness of truth generally.  The appellant contended, further, that the Crown Prosecutor's comment had the effect of undermining her Honour's direction that there may be a number of reasons why a person has a motive to lie.  
91This submission misconstrues the Crown Prosecutor's address.  It was permissible for the Crown Prosecutor to refer to the complainant's evidence, just as it was permissible for the appellant's defence counsel to cross-examine the complainant to the effect that she was lying.  It would have been impermissible for the Crown Prosecutor to indicate to the jury that the complainant had no motive to lie in a way to suggest that the appellant thereby bore an onus to establish that there was a motive, or that he bore an onus to establish that the complainant was in fact lying.  However, the Crown Prosecutor did not cross that impermissible line.  Rather, he referred to this evidence as an introduction to his invitation to the jury to accept the complainant as a witness of truth, having regard to the spontaneity of her answer and her upset with being called a liar in respect of her allegations against the appellant.  
92The appellant's further submission that the Crown Prosecutor's comment undermined the trial judge's direction should also be rejected.  It misunderstands, or at least fails to reflect, the fundamental principle that it is the responsibility of the trial judge, by an appropriate direction, to correct any statement to the jury by the Crown or the defence that is wrong in law, is misleading or which may cause the jury to enter upon an impermissible mode of reasoning.  Should such a statement be made to a jury, the question for consideration will be whether the trial judge's direction was adequate in the circumstances, not whether the trial judge's direction was undermined by an earlier comment made to the jury by the Crown Prosecutor or the defence.
93Accordingly, ground 2 of the appeal is rejected.
Trial judge's direction to the jury
94Notwithstanding that the Court has rejected ground 2, nevertheless, it remained necessary for her Honour to give a direction in respect of this part of the complainant's evidence.
95The trial judge gave the following direction to the jury in respect of that evidence:
""Now Crown counsel referred when referring to [the complainant's] evidence as to [the complainant] exclaiming words something like 'why would I lie?'.  He went on to tell you other things in this context.  You may think it was an expression of frustration at the line of cross-examination rather than a question that begs an answer.  It is a matter for you, however I am asked to give you a direction about that and I will do so.  It may be that you will ask yourselves why this complainant ... would make up such a serious allegation against [the appellant].  I am going to give you directions in relation to that.  
As you have been told the essential elements of the Crown Case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt or [the appellant] must be acquitted.  If the case turns upon the evidence of [the complainant], you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has told the truth.  As you have been told it is your duty to decide whether you accept the evidence of a witness in whole or in part, [the complainant's] evidence is no exception to that.  It would be wrong for you to conclude that [the complainant] is telling the truth because there is no apparent reason in your view for her to lie.  People lie for all sorts of reasons, sometimes it is apparent, sometimes it is not, sometimes the reason is discovered, sometimes it is not, you cannot be satisfied that she is telling the truth merely because there is no apparent reason for her to have made up the allegations.  There might be a reason for her to be untruthful that nobody knows about.  As always it is an assessment of her evidence that is a matter for you.  I am going to refer briefly to other evidence that was given.""  
96The appellant contended, as already indicated, that her Honour's direction was inadequate.  The trial judge correctly and clearly directed the jury on this question.  Her Honour first drew the jury's attention to the particular evidence in respect of which she was giving a direction, that is, the complainant's response, ""Why would I lie?""  Her Honour reminded the jury that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.  She directed the jury that:
""If the case turns upon the evidence of [the complainant], you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has told the truth.""  (emphasis added)  
97Her Honour then stated that it would be wrong for the jury to conclude that the complainant was lying ""because there is no apparent reason in your view for her to lie"".  Her Honour pointed out that the complainant may have ""a reason ... to be untruthful that nobody knows about"".  Her Honour concluded that it was a matter for the jury to assess her evidence.  The jury had already been told at the commencement of this particular direction that if the case depended upon the complainant's evidence, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she had told the truth.
98The only difference in this direction from what was said to be necessary in Uhrig was that it was stated in a different order from that indicated in Uhrig.  That is not sufficient for a conclusion that her Honour's direction was inadequate.  In our opinion, her Honour stated both components of the Uhrig direction in a way that was clear and comprehensible.  
Ground 3(b):  the trial judge erred by failing to give a proper and/or adequate warning to the jury as to the unreliability of evidence of admissions
99Ground 3(b) relates to the evidence of the Crown witness, LT.  There were six conversations between the appellant and LT that possibly constituted admissions.  Those conversations have been identified above at [36]-[41]. 
100The appellant's defence counsel cross-examined LT to the effect that she had concocted her evidence of admissions and had colluded with the complainant's mother to give false evidence.  It was implicit in the cross-examination that LT had given false evidence in retribution for the bad breakdown of LT's relationship with the appellant.
101At trial, the appellant's defence counsel sought a direction pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995, s 165 in respect of LT's evidence.  That section applies, inter alia, to evidence of admissions:  see the Evidence Act, s 165(1)(a) and Pt 3.4 relating to admissions.
102Section 165(2) provides:  
""If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and(b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and(c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.""
103Section 165(3) provides: 
""The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.""
104There was lengthy discussion between the trial judge and the appellant's defence counsel as to the evidence in respect of which admission the direction was sought and the terms of the direction that was to be given.  The appellant's defence counsel sought a direction in relation to the second conversation, regarding David Hunt;  the third conversation, regarding kickboxing;  and the fourth conversation, regarding the shower.  The appellant's defence counsel indicated his agreement with the trial judge as to the direction that she proposed to give in relation to each of these conversations.
105The appellant's defence counsel did not specifically seek a direction pursuant to s 165 in relation to the first conversation.  Nonetheless, the trial judge raised the matter with counsel and indicated the terms of the direction that she proposed to give in relation to that conversation.  The appellant's defence counsel did not seek any further or alternate direction in relation to that matter.
106The trial judge gave directions to the jury in relation to these four conversations that reflected what she had discussed with the appellant's defence counsel.  
107In his written submissions on the appeal, the appellant first noted that the trial judge had directed the jury that tendency evidence, which evinced sexual interest in the complainant, had to be proved to the satisfaction of the jury to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt:  see DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272;  200 A Crim R 206 at [31].  In this respect, her Honour directed the jury that they could not rely on the evidence that LT gave regarding any conversation she had with the appellant or what she observed, unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was telling the truth about those matters.
108The appellant's submissions then drew attention to the following directions her Honour gave regarding the evidence of admissions:
""Before any part of the statement alleged to have been made may be used as evidence against [the appellant] ... you must be satisfied that [the appellant] and [LT] had the conversation with [the appellant].  If you are not so satisfied, then you should disregard the statement and it should not form any part of your consideration in the evidence against him.  If you are however so satisfied that the statement was made, then you must consider what it meant.  
The statement only becomes evidence against [the appellant] if you are satisfied that he has, in saying the things he said or by the circumstances in which he said them, acknowledged the truth of the facts asserted in the statement as you find them to mean.  If you find those matters satisfied, then it does become evidence against the accused.""
109The appellant complained that this direction related only to whether the jury would accept that the admission had been made and, if made, its reliability.  The appellant contended that her Honour failed to properly direct the jury in accordance with the requirements imposed by s 165(2).  In this regard, the appellant submitted that the section mandated:  a direction that the evidence may be unreliable:  s 165(2)(a);  an explanation as to the matters which may cause it to be unreliable:  s 165(2)(b);  and a direction as to the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
110The appellant submitted that the matters that warranted the giving of a warning included LT's convictions, including those relating to dishonesty, the acrimonious nature of the breakdown of her relationship with the appellant, the fact that she had given an affidavit in support of the complainant's mother's Family Court proceedings as well as the omission of relevant matters in court documents which called for inclusion.  
111However, in the exchange with the trial judge, the appellant's defence counsel expressly agreed that the direction that he was seeking in relation to the second admission was in respect of these matters.  More importantly, the appellant's defence counsel accepted that as he had informed the jury in his address of these matters and thus why they wouldn't act on those alleged admissions, it was not necessary for her Honour to canvas those matters in her direction.
112It is apparent from the trial transcript that the appellant's defence counsel had not only made a strident attack on the credibility of LT, but was well apprised of the provisions of the Evidence Act, s 165.  He made a specific application for a direction pursuant to the section.  However, in the course of the discussion with the trial judge, he specifically agreed to the terms of the directions that ought to be given.  Her Honour confirmed the terms in which she proposed to direct the jury the following day.  The appellant's defence counsel agreed with the direction that was to be given.  In these circumstances, the trial judge was not required to give the jury a direction in terms that encompassed the specific warning and information specified in s 165(2).  
113The same occurred with the directions in respect of the other admissions.
114In those circumstances, ground 3(b) should also be rejected.  
Ground 4:  miscarriage of justice
115The appellant contended that even if each of the above grounds failed individually, the combination or aggregation of the defects alleged in the several grounds of appeal constituted a miscarriage of justice.  He submitted that ""[d]espite the strength of the Crown case, the appellant did not have, as he was entitled to have, a fair and proper trial"".  
116The appellant referred to R v Kotzmann [1999] VSCA 27;  2 VR 12 in support of this submission, but did not direct the Court's attention to any particular portion of that judgment.  Having read the decision, it appears that the intended reference was to the reasons of Batt JA in respect of a ground of appeal in which it was alleged that the trial judge's summing up to the jury was unbalanced.  However, that does not appear to be the nature of the present complaint.
117As the appellant's submission recognised, although the outcome of the trial was dependent upon the jury's acceptance of the evidence of the complainant, the complainant's evidence was credible and well able to be accepted by the jury in satisfaction of the guilt of the appellant on the requisite standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  There were early complaints made by the complainant.  Her evidence was not undermined by the cross-examination.  The evidence of the other witnesses, although subject to strenuous challenge, was not undermined in any way that militated against its acceptance.
118In any event, the Court is not satisfied that there were defects in the conduct of the case as alleged by the appellant.  It follows that ground 4 should also be rejected.
Leave to appeal on sentence
Trial judge's general remarks on sentence
119The appellant was convicted of four offences for which the trial judge sentenced the appellant as follows:
Count 2: A fixed term of 2 years commencing on 20 May 2009 and to expire on 19 May 2011.
Count 1: A fixed term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 20 November 2009 and to expire on 19 May 2012.
Count 3: A term of 8 years commencing on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 May 2018, consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 May 2016 and a balance of term of 2 years to commence on 20 May 2016 and to expire on 190 May 2018.
Count 5: A term of 10 years commencing on 20 May 2012 and to expire on 19 May 2022 consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years 9 months commencing on 20 May 2012 and to expire on 19 February 2019 and a balance of term of 3 years 3 months to commence on 20 February 2019 and to expire on 19 May 2022.
120The appellant raised three grounds of appeal should leave to appeal be granted:
(1) The trial judge misstated the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 61M(2) at the time of commission of count 3.
(2) The trial judge erred in finding that the commission of the offence in the home was an aggravating feature.
(3) The trial judge erred in not finding special circumstances.
121The Crown conceded grounds 1 and 2.  Accordingly, leave to appeal should be granted at least in respect of those two grounds.  Although the Crown conceded error, it will be necessary to consider grounds 1 and 2 in more detail, as the nature of the error may impact upon whether this Court should re-sentence the appellant. 
122It is convenient, however, to refer first to her Honour's remarks on sentence generally and then to deal with the remarks that are relevant to the proposed specific grounds of appeal.
123The trial judge stated that when considering the objective seriousness of the offences as a whole, there were many features common to all or most of them.  Her Honour observed that as the individual offences, especially those that occurred between 1999 and 2003, were part of a series of similar events or a course of conduct that continued whilst the complainant's mother was at work, there was no basis to extend leniency that otherwise might have flowed to the appellant when imposing sentence.
124Her Honour considered that many of the offences were ""opportunistic"" and did not involve a great deal of planning.  However, given that there was a break of some years in the periods in which the offending occurred and that after expiry of the AVO, the appellant recommenced his offending conduct, her Honour found that there was ""some premeditative knowledge that [the complainant] was likely to be available for abuse"".  Her Honour also considered that LT's evidence of the appellant putting his hand down his trousers whilst talking to the child in the period when there was no direct contact with the complainant, was evidence of ""a continued depraved attitude to [the complainant] between the offending years"".
125In her Honour's opinion, the family context in which the offending occurred was an aggravating feature involving a breach of trust.  Her Honour noted that the offending continued even after a complaint had been made to the police, conduct which her Honour described in terms of ""the arrogance of this continued offending"".
126Her Honour noted that good character was not relied upon but nonetheless observed that up until the commission of the first offence in 1999, the appellant had no prior offences of this nature.  However, her Honour found that to be of little assistance to him.  Her Honour also noted that save for the offence committed whilst he was under a supervised s 12 bond for a driving offence, his criminal antecedents were not an aggravating feature that would deprive him of leniency.
127The appellant had exhibited no remorse and her Honour held that a finding could not be made that there were positive prospects for rehabilitation, ""at this time at least"".  
128There was no delay in the making of the complaints and her Honour considered that the earlier offences, of which complaint was made and which were expressly the basis of the AVO, compounded his later offending.  Her Honour accepted that the complainant had been seriously affected by the commission of the assaults upon her.  She had suffered anxiety and continuing psychological and relationship problems.  Her Honour found that the damage so caused was significant, although noted, correctly, that it was not a separate instance of aggravation.
129In summary, therefore, there were no mitigating circumstances in favour of the appellant and the individual offences were serious.  The appellant does not argue that the sentences imposed, either individually or in combination, were manifestly excessive.  Rather, he raised the three alleged errors in the sentencing process.  
Ground 1:  wrong statement of standard non-parole period
130The first error alleged by the appellant was her Honour's incorrect statement of the standard non-parole period in respect of count 3.  The Crown conceded this error.  The standard non-parole period applicable to the s 61M(2) offence at the time of its commission was 5 years, not 8 years as stated by her Honour.  Her Honour sentenced the appellant to a non parole period of 6 years for this offence.  She did so in circumstances where she had found that the offence was just below the mid range of seriousness. 
131The appellant submitted that the error was such that this Court was required to re-sentence him in respect of count 3.  The appellant also submitted that the error impacted upon the sentence imposed for count 5.  
132Although her Honour did not expressly say so, it is apparent that her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was the reason she set a non-parole period that was less than the standard non-parole period.  Apart from a general submission that no lesser sentence was warranted in law, the Crown did not otherwise advance any submission relating to her Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.  
133Her Honour sentenced the appellant prior to the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39;  244 CLR 120.  Prior to Muldrock, sentencing judges followed the approach to sentencing sanctioned by this Court in Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131;  60 NSWLR 168.  That approach involved first assessing where on the hypothetical range of objective seriousness the individual offence lay and then calculating the non-parole period of the sentence by reference to that assessment.  If the offence lay in the mid-range of seriousness, the assumption was that the starting point for the non-parole period was the prescribed standard non-parole period.  In other words, s 54B(2) was considered to be mandatory in its operation.
134However, in Muldrock, the High Court confirmed the principle it had stated in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25;  228 CLR 357, namely, that in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for a particular offence, the sentencing judge was required to identify all factors relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence, given all the factors in the case.  
135The operation of that principle in circumstances where a standard non-parole period is prescribed requires the sentencing court to have regard to the standard non-parole period as one of the factors relevant to sentence, but not to adopt it as a starting point.  The High Court stated, at [27] 132:
""Section 54B(2) and s 54B(3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as 'the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness'. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""
136The Court continued, at [28]-[29] 132:
""Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period. 
A central purpose of Div 1A is to require sentencing judges to state fully the reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. The reference in s 54B(4) to 'mak[ing] a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period' is not to be understood as suggesting either the need to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period, or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending. It does require the judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The obligation applies in sentencing for all Div 1A offences regardless of whether the offender has been convicted after trial or whether the offence might be characterised as falling in the low, middle or high range of objective seriousness for such offences.""
137In sentencing the appellant, her Honour considered the objective circumstances of the offending before determining its objective seriousness.  In doing so, she did not include any matters relevant to the subjective circumstances of the appellant.  That may have been because, as her Honour's remarks reveal, there were no relevant subjective circumstances.  Nonetheless, no criticism can be made of her Honour's remarks to that point.  However, it is apparent that her Honour too prescriptively tied the non-parole period to the standard non-parole period.
138Having imposed a non-parole period of 6 years, her Honour imposed an additional term of 2 years.  Her Honour thus imposed a total sentence of 8 years for an offence where the maximum term was 10 years imprisonment, in circumstances where her Honour had assessed the offending conduct to be below the mid range of objective seriousness.  That sentence reflected the error she made in respect of the standard non-parole period and was excessive.  
139The sentence imposed in respect of count 3 is also challenged on the basis that her Honour erroneously took into account as an aggravating factor, that the offence was committed in the complainant's home:  see ground 2.  That challenge, which is discussed below, has been made out.  Accordingly, in determining whether some other sentence is warranted in law:  see Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6, that factor will not be relevant.  
140Apart from a general submission that no lesser sentence was warranted in law, the Crown did not submit that the offending in respect of count 3 was of a more serious nature than her Honour determined.  Nor did the appellant submit that, apart from the error in treating the fact that the offence occurred in the home as an aggravating feature, her Honour took into account extraneous or irrelevant factors in determining the objective seriousness of the offence.  
141Putting aside the likely error in imposing a non-parole by reference to the standard non-parole period in the way described, we consider her Honour's characterisation of the offending was correct.  However, because of the error, it is necessary to consider whether some other sentence is warranted in law.
142In the Court's opinion, some other sentence is warranted.  The total sentence imposed by her Honour was 80 per cent of the maximum sentence for an offence that she characterised as being below the mid-range of objective seriousness.  Although it is not necessary in accordance with the principles stated in Muldrock to make a determination in those terms, her Honour's finding correctly reflects the objective seriousness of the offence.  In re-sentencing the appellant for this offence, the relevant matters are that this was the first occasion the appellant had directly touched the complainant, count 1 having involved touching on the outside of the complainant's underwear and count 2 having involved the appellant causing the complainant to rub oil on his penis.  The appellant's conduct on this occasion exhibited a heightened and more serious degree of sexual conduct on and towards the complainant.  Further, as found by her Honour, there were no relevant mitigating features to which regard must be had.  In all the circumstances, the sentence we consider ought to be imposed for count 3 is a non-parole period of 3 years and an additional term of 1 year. 
143Although this sentence is considerably lower than that imposed by the trial judge, the Court considers it properly reflects the appellant's criminality on this occasion and can only reiterate that her Honour's sentencing process was erroneous, it would appear, because of her adherence to the standard non-parole period, adjusted downwards to take into account her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence being just below the mid-range.  
Ground 2:  treating the commission of the offence in the home as an aggravating feature
144The trial judge treated as an aggravating circumstance in respect of the offences in counts 1, 2 and 3 the fact that the offending conduct occurred in the home.  At the time of each of those offences, the appellant was in the complainant's home, either by invitation, or because he was then living with the complainant's mother.  The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in two respects in finding that the commission of the offence in the home was an aggravating feature.  
145First, the fact of the offence occurring in the victim's home is only an aggravating feature pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 21A(2)(eb) if the offender is not otherwise lawfully in the home:  see Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88.  In that case, McClellan CJ at CL (James and Davies JJ agreeing) noted, at [112], that there is a clear line of authority in the Court that s 21A(2)(eb) does not operate to aggravate an offence in that circumstance:  see R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125;  EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199 at [79] (per R A Hulme J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).  See also R v Preston (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 9 April 1997). 
146Secondly, s 21A(2)(eb) was inserted into the Act by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 with effect only from 1 January 2008, that is, after the offending conduct.  
147This ground was also conceded by the Crown.
148Notwithstanding that her Honour erred in taking into account the fact that the offending occurred in the home as an aggravating feature in respect of counts 1 and 2, we have concluded that no other sentence is warranted in law in respect of those sentences.  
149As already indicated, the appellant is to be re-sentenced in respect of count 3 because of her Honour's error in respect of the standard non-parole period.  In determining the appropriate sentence in respect of that count, the fact that the offending occurred in the home has not been included as an aggravating factor.  
Ground 3:  failure to find special circumstances
150The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to take into account the length of the total sentence imposed, given the partial accumulation of the sentences, as a matter warranting consideration as a special circumstance such that there should have been a variation to the statutory ratio.
151The Crown submitted that her Honour gave attention to the question of accumulation in her following remarks. 
""In relation to the issue of accumulated sentences, I advise that it is intended to adjust the period of parole supervision on the final accumulated offence to reflect the appropriate ratio on the total sentence and of course there will be some accumulation in relation to each of these sentences."" 
152The Crown's submission on this ground should be accepted.  Her Honour gave consideration to whether there should be an alteration to the statutory ratio given that there had been some accumulation of sentences and gave her reasons for the approach she took to that question.  Her neither overlooked the question of accumulation as alleged, nor did she err in her approach she took to that question.  Leave to appeal against sentence on this ground is not granted.  
The re-sentence issue
153The Court has stated its view as to the sentence that ought to be imposed in respect of count 3.  That requires a re-sentencing in respect of that offence.  The question then arises whether that re-sentence will have any impact upon the total sentence imposed.  Her Honour partially accumulated each of the sentences imposed.  The sentence thus imposed was a total effective non-parole period of 9 years 9 months and a total additional term of 3 years 3 months.  
154The Court has reached the conclusion on the re-sentence that the periods of partial accumulation ordered by her Honour were appropriate and resulted in a total effective sentence both by way of a non-parole period and an additional term that was appropriate in all the circumstances.  Accordingly, the Court has imposed the same periods of accumulation as ordered by the trial judge.  The result is that on the re-sentence there will be no difference to the total sentence that was imposed by the trial judge.  
155The Court makes the following orders:
1. Appeal against conviction dismissed;
2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence;
3. Appeal against sentence allowed;
4. Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 and 2;
5. Quash the sentences imposed in respect of counts 3 and 5;
6. Re-sentence the appellant in respect of counts 3 and 5 in the manner specified below, so that the sentences imposed on the appellant, including those imposed for counts 1 and 2, are as follows: 
Count 2: A fixed term of 2 years to commence on 20 May 2009 and to expire on 19 May 2011;
Count 1: A fixed term of 2 years 6 months to commence on 20 November 2009 and to expire on 19 May 2012;
Count 3: A non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 May 2013 and an additional term of 1 year to commence on 20 May 2013 and to expire on 19 May 2014;

2707940,"Goundar, Diana v R [2012] NSWCCA 154","Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J and with his reasons. While the later sentence imposed on Mr Goundar is not irrelevant, I agree with Harrison J that little assistance is gained from a discussion of ""parity"". In this respect my observations in R v Chandler; Chandler v R [2012] NSWCCA 135 at [3]-[8] are apposite. Sentencing for different offences may justify an outcome which does not reflect an abstract consideration of the degrees of moral culpability of each offender. The differential element in the present case arose not from the exercise of a prosecutorial decision as to the appropriate charges to be laid, but from the fact that Mr Goundar was convicted of a less serious offence than that to which the applicant entered a plea of guilty.

2HARRISON J: The applicant pleaded guilty to the murder of Rajnesh Singh on 11 February 2007. James J sentenced her on 14 August 2009 to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 23 February 2007. She seeks leave to appeal to this Court against the severity of her sentence upon the ground that she has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the disparity between her sentence and that imposed upon her co-offender Munesh Goundar and upon the further ground that the sentence imposed was otherwise manifestly excessive. The appeal is out of time. The Crown does not oppose the extension of time within which to bring the appeal.

3The applicant was sentenced upon the basis of agreed facts to which James J referred in detail. Those facts are relevantly as follows.

4The applicant and Munesh Goundar were married to each other but were separated before their respective offences were committed. The applicant was 26 years old when the deceased was killed. Her husband was 27. The deceased and the applicant had entered into a sexual relationship that had been discovered by her husband.

5The deceased was killed on 11 February 2007 at the residence formerly occupied by the applicant and her husband at Prestons in Sydney. Neither was residing at the premises at the time due to their separation. The house still contained their belongings.

6The deceased went to the premises. He was stabbed in the upstairs section of the house numerous times by the applicant's husband. He was forced into the bathroom where he was stabbed several more times. He was then placed in the bathtub where he later died. He was then dragged down the stairs and placed in the boot of Mr Goundar's car. The applicant and her husband then drove to Heathcote and disposed of the body.

7The following day the deceased was reported missing. An investigation commenced. On 20 February 2007 police attended the home of Mr Goundar looking for him. He was not there. On 21 February 2007 Mr Goundar left Australia for New Zealand. Two days later police attended the Prestons premises and discovered what appeared to be blood stains in the house. That evening the applicant was arrested and participated in an ERISP in which she made a series of admissions. These are referred to below. The applicant took police to the location at Heathcote where the deceased's body was later found.

8James J accepted the truth of the following admissions made by the applicant:

""On Sunday 11 February 2007 [the applicant] and [her husband] were at their home address. At about 12.10pm [Mr Goundar] directed her to contact the deceased on his mobile phone. She spoke to the deceased and asked him to attend her house so they could talk.

At about 3.40pm the deceased drove his white Pantech truck to [the Prestons premises]. Upon hearing his truck arrive [Mr Goundar] told her not to tell the deceased he was there and he ran upstairs.

She answered the door and had a conversation with the deceased. Once inside the premises the deceased heard noises and asked if there was anybody else home. She told the deceased she was alone. The deceased sat on the downstairs couch opposite her and a short time later he suggested they go upstairs. They walked upstairs to the master bedroom.

She entered the room first and the deceased followed. At this time she saw [Mr Goundar] crouched down inside the wardrobe holding a knife. [He] leapt from the wardrobe wielding the knife. [Mr Goundar] set upon the deceased pushing him down the hallway into the toilet. [Mr Goundar] pushed the deceased into a sitting position on the toilet and stabbed him in the back. The deceased started to scream and [Mr Goundar] covered his mouth with his hand.

[Mr Goundar] told [the applicant] to close all the windows upstairs and down stairs and to turn the radio on loud to mask the noise of the attack. She complied.

After doing this, she went back upstairs and saw the deceased lying with his head on the tiles. At this time [Mr Goundar] repeatedly stomped on his head with his foot. [He] also stabbed the deceased to the torso area a number of times.

[Mr Goundar] dragged the deceased to the bathroom and placed him in the bath. [He] turned the cold water tap on. The bathtub was not plugged and the bath did not fill up. The deceased was moaning in pain.

[Mr Goundar] instructed [the applicant] to start cleaning the blood from the toilet and carpet area. She obtained cleaning products and started to clean. [Mr Goundar] told her he was going to move the deceased's truck from outside the premises and he told her to continue cleaning.

[Mr Goundar] returned a short time later and told her to put all the clothes in the washing machine, have a shower and go to her mother's house. He told her to return when it got dark. [The applicant] saw [Mr Goundar] go downstairs and return with a tea towel which he placed over the deceased's mouth to muffle the sound. She placed the clothes into the washing machine, had a shower and left the premises. The deceased was still alive in the bathtub at this time.

A few hours later she returned. She noticed that [Mr Goundar] had cleaned the premises and had covered the deceased in a fitted blue bed sheet from one of the cupboards. He informed her that the deceased was dead.

[The applicant] helped [Mr Goundar] move his vehicle into the garage of the house, which has internal access to the premises. She held the deceased's legs and he held his arms and they carried him downstairs and into the garage. She noticed that blood was dripping all over the stairs. [Mr Goundar] laid out another sheet in the boot of the vehicle and they placed the deceased onto the sheet, shut the boot and left the premises. [Mr Goundar] drove.

They drove to Forum Drive, Heathcote where [Mr Goundar] removed the deceased from the boot and dragged him into bushland. He returned a short time later and obtained a petrol tin from the vehicle and walked away. He returned to the car and informed [the applicant] that he had dumped the deceased over a cliff where he would not be seen. He said he intended to set the body on fire, however it was raining and he did not have a lighter.

The couple left the area and returned to the crime scene. [Mr Goundar] told her that he was going to dump the deceased's truck in Sydenham and he left the premises in the truck.

That night [Mr Goundar] called her a number of times to see if she was alright. She slept the night at the premises alone and went to work the next day. During the day [Mr Goundar] returned to the premises and finished cleaning. He gathered all of the bloodstained items and disposed of them.

Over the next few days [the applicant] and [Mr Goundar] had a number of conversations about the murder. During these conversations [he] told her that he had parked the truck at either Liverpool or Warwick Farm, he had disposed of the knife down a drain and he had placed the bloodstained items in a garbage bin.""

9Mr Goundar was subsequently arrested in New Zealand. He was charged with the murder of the deceased. He pleaded not guilty to the murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown refused to accept that plea. The trial proceeded. The only real issue was whether the Crown had excluded beyond reasonable doubt the partial defence of provocation. On 15 June 2010 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

10On 5 November 2010 Kirby J sentenced Mr Goundar to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years to date from 8 March 2007 with a total sentence of 10 years and 8 months expiring on 7 November 2017. Mr Goundar will be eligible for release on parole on 7 March 2015.

11It will be apparent that Mr Goundar was convicted 10 months, and was sentenced 15 months, after the applicant had pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased. The facts found by Kirby J for sentencing purposes were not altogether the same as the agreed facts upon which the applicant was sentenced: see Regina v Munesh Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170 at [4] to [43].

Consideration

12The applicant contended that a reasonable person considering the circumstances of the offence and the respective roles played by her and her husband would consider that she was justified in feeling aggrieved at the length of her sentence when compared with that of her co-offender. She also submitted that despite the fact that the sentence was significantly less than the standard non-parole period for murder, the ""extraordinary findings in respect of the objective criminality of the offence"" demonstrate that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

13In order to understand these submissions it is important to have a full appreciation of the approach taken by James J in assessing the objective criminality of the applicant's conduct upon the basis of the facts that were before him for sentencing purposes. His Honour had this to say:

""61 It is necessary to assess the level of objective seriousness of the prisoner's offence, for general sentencing purposes and also because murder is an offence for which a standard non-parole period has been set.

62 On the evidence before me in these proceedings for the sentencing of the prisoner, the offence committed by Munesh Goundar was of a high level of objective seriousness. As pointed out by the Crown, the victim was stabbed many times, his body was stomped on and he was subjected to a slow and painful death.

63 However, the function I have to perform in sentencing the prisoner is to assess the level of objective seriousness of the offence committed by the prisoner. It was common ground at the sentencing hearing that this conduct would include her conduct after the death of the victim, that is her conduct as an accessory after the fact.

64 As I have already noted, the Crown submitted that the prisoner's criminal liability was based on her having become a party to a joint criminal enterprise. Counsel for the prisoner submitted that it would be more appropriate to base the prisoner's criminal liability on her having been an accessory by aiding and abetting Munesh Goundar, by being present at the time when the crime of murder was being committed by Munesh Goundar and, knowing that that crime was being committed by Munesh Goundar, assisting [him] to commit that crime. At one stage counsel for the Crown suggested that the prisoner had been a principal in the first degree but, consistently with the Crown's concession that there had not been any pre-concert between Munesh Goundar and the prisoner to kill or even harm the victim, the prisoner could only have been a principal in the second degree.

65 I consider that it is preferable to classify the prisoner's criminal liability as being that of an aider and abetter but it would not appear to me to make any material difference whether her liability is regarded as based on her having been a party to a joint criminal enterprise or on her having been an aider and abetter.

66 It was accepted by the Crown that, notwithstanding occasional statements in the cases which might suggest the contrary, it is not the law that all parties to the same joint criminal enterprise should necessarily be regarded as having the same degree of objective criminality.

67 In GAS v The Queen... the High Court said... that while it is not a universal principle that the culpability of an aider and abetter is less than that of a principal offender, aiders and abetters can be less culpable and the degree of differentiation between the principal and the aider and abetter will depend upon circumstances of the particular case.

68 At the sentencing hearing the Crown conceded that the level of objective criminality of the prisoner was lower than the level of objective criminality of Munesh Goundar.

69 I consider that the objective criminality of the prisoner was not only much less than the objective criminality of Munesh Goundar but also below, and well below, the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder. There are a number of reasons for this conclusion.

70 The prisoner did not participate in any planning for the offence and there was no pre-meditation at all on her part. The Crown accepted, quite properly on the agreed facts and on the other evidence in the proceedings on sentence, that the prisoner had become a party to any joint criminal enterprise only at the point when the prisoner saw Munesh Goundar leap from the wardrobe in the upstairs bedroom, wielding a knife.

71 The prisoner did not know or intend that the victim should be harmed, when, at the direction of Munesh Goundar, she telephoned the victim and asked him to come to the house. The purpose of the invitation was, according to the statement of agreed facts, 'so they could talk'. The Crown accepted that the prisoner did not lure the victim to the house so that he could be attacked.

72 It is true that, after the victim had arrived at the house, the prisoner told him, falsely, that she was alone in the house but she did not then know or intend any harm to the victim. It was the victim's idea that he and the prisoner should go upstairs in the house.

73 The prisoner did not herself inflict any violence on the victim. According to answers in her interview by police, which were not challenged, she at times asked Munesh Goundar to stop assaulting the victim.

74 All that the prisoner did, prior to the death of the victim, was to close all the windows in the house upstairs and downstairs, to turn the radio on loud, to clean blood from the toilet and the carpet and to put bloodstained clothes in the washing machine. She did all these things in compliance with directions given to her by Munesh Goundar.

75 The prisoner did play a larger role after the death of the deceased in helping Munesh Goundar carry the body of the victim out of the house and place the body in the boot of the vehicle and in accompanying Munesh Goundar to Heathcote.""

14James J went on at [113] to conclude that the combination of the objective criminality of the applicant, the combined discount of 40 percent for her guilty plea and her offer of assistance to authorities, as well as her voluntary disclosure of her previously undisclosed guilt and other favourable subjective circumstances made ""this case truly extraordinary"". In expressing that conclusion when he did, his Honour could also not have anticipated that Mr Goundar, who was clearly the principal offender, would in due course be acquitted of murder upon the basis of the partial defence of provocation, or that he would be sentenced in those circumstances to a term of imprisonment that was less than the sentence that his Honour was about to impose upon the applicant.

15It is true that there is a remarkable disconformity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant by James J and the sentence imposed upon Mr Goundar by Kirby J. The most significant basis for the differing sentences is probably to be found in the difference between the offences for which each offender was sentenced. The applicant pleaded guilty to murder. Her husband was convicted of manslaughter following a trial before a jury. Even though that difference does not operate as a matter of principle to disqualify a submission by the applicant based, or drawing upon, considerations of parity, it does not seem to me to be the most obvious or fruitful source of inquiry into the merit of the applicant's challenge to the appropriateness of her sentence. In the particular circumstances of this case a more fundamental consideration applies.

16In my opinion the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive. His Honour's own careful analysis and characterisation of the applicant's role in these extraordinary events plainly speaks loudly in favour of a far more lenient sentence than the one he imposed. I note in this respect that no challenge is raised to his Honour's reasons or reasoning that led to his conclusion that the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending was considerably lower than that of Mr Goundar, whatever may have been the offence of which they were each ultimately convicted. Moreover, no challenge is raised to his Honour's quite unremarkable conclusion that the applicant's offending was not only below, but also well below, the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder.

17It seems to me that his Honour's notional starting point for the determination of the applicant's sentence was simply too high. It is accepted arithmetically, having regard to the sentence arrived at by his Honour, after applying the discounts and other matters that he so clearly indicated he would include, that the starting point was 20 years. That corresponded to the standard non-parole period for murder. In my view that starting point was too high and considerably higher than a proper starting point in light of all of his Honour's other findings. In my view this has produced a sentence that is manifestly excessive. I am of the view that some lesser sentence is warranted at law.

Conclusion and orders

18Having regard to the uncontroversial conclusions and findings arrived at by his Honour concerning the level of objective seriousness of the applicant's crime, hers was not a case in which an adoption of the standard non-parole period as a starting point for her sentence was proper. In my view, a proper starting point for the sentence to be imposed on the applicant in this case is 16 years. I propose to apply that starting point to all of his Honour's calculations and findings without further alteration or amendment. Doing so with (approximately) arithmetical precision produces a head sentence of 9 years 7 months and 3 days, with a non-parole period of 7 years 2 months and 12 days. It is appropriate to round these periods down to the nearest whole month.

19I consider in these circumstances that the following orders should be made:

1. Grant leave to appeal out of time and allow the appeal.

2. Quash the sentence imposed upon the applicant by James J on 14 August 2011.

3. In lieu of the sentence imposed by James J, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 7 years and 2 months commencing on 23 February 2007 and expiring on 22 April 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years 4 and months.

4. Accordingly, the earliest day on which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole is 22 April 2014.

20BEECH-JONES J: I agree with the reasons of Harrison J and the orders he proposes. For the sake of completeness I note that once the applicant's sentence is adjusted in the manner proposed by his Honour then the complaint of a lack of parity between her sentence and that imposed on her husband, if it had any force, falls way especially when regard is had to the different offences they were convicted of and the different factual bases upon which they were sentenced.

CORRIGENDUM: 23 July 2012

21THE COURT: Since the judgment was delivered in this matter a discrepancy was identified between the statement in the order on resentencing that the balance of term was 2 years 4 months (incorrectly rendered as ""2 years 4 and months"" and the reasons, at [18], which indicated that the head sentence was to be 9 years 7 months and the non-parole period 7 years 2 months. The difference (2 years 5 months) was the balance of term. An arithmetical mistake was made in the translation into order 3. Accordingly, order 3 is varied, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 50C(3), to read:

3. In lieu of the sentence imposed by James J, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 7 years and 2 months commencing on 23 February 2007 and expiring on 22 April 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years and 5 months.

2707958,Haydon v R [2012] NSWCCA 151,"Judgment

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 

2Price J:  Matthew Haydon seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 17 December 2010. 

3The applicant had adhered in the District Court to a plea of guilty entered in the Local Court to a charge of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, on 27 May 2010 contrary to s 113(2) Crimes Act 1900. The circumstances of aggravation were that he was in company with the co-offender David Davis. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 14 years imprisonment.

4Three matters on a Form 1 were taken into account by the Judge on sentence for the s 113(2) offence, being:

(i)take and drive a white Toyota Hilux on 27 May 2010 without the consent of the owner contrary to s 154A(1)(a) Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which is 5 years imprisonment; 

(ii)receiving a bullbar between 10 April 2010 and 14 April 2010 knowing it to have been stolen contrary to s 189 Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which is 3 years imprisonment and;

(iii)display altered number plate on 27 May 2010 contrary to s 85(2)(a) Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Regulation 2007. This offence is punishable by 20 penalty units.

5The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months commencing on 25 July 2012 and expiring on 24 September 2014 with a balance of term of 13 months expiring on 24 October 2015. 

6A plea of guilty had also been entered by the applicant to a charge of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny on 27 May 2010 contrary to s 112(1)(a) Crime Act. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment. For this offence, a non-parole period of 1 year 10 months commencing on 25 June 2011 and expiring on 24 April 2013 with a balance of term of 8 months expiring on 24 December 2013 was imposed. Davis was not involved in the s. 112(1)(a) offence.

7Davis was sentenced on the same day as the applicant for the s 113(2) offence by the Judge to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 ½ months commencing on 27 September 2010 and expiring on 12 November 2011 with a balance of term of 4 ½ months expiring on 26 March 2012. 

8The sentencing proceedings for the applicant and the co-offender had been heard together and Davis was sentenced after the applicant. An agreed statement of facts for the s 113(2) offence had been tendered, which was recounted by the Judge in his sentencing remarks for each offender. 

9The agreed facts are as follows: 

""Aggravated (in company) break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (steal)

At about 9am on Thursday 27 May 2010, the offender Matthew HAYDON and the co-offender David DAVIS arrived at the Surfside Motel Ocean Drive, Lake Cathie. The offender HAYDON and co-offender DAVIS were in a white Nissan Patrol. A witness wrote down the registration of the vehicle (as they were acting suspiciously) and had a conversation with the co-offender DAVIS.

The witness walked away from the vehicle and looked back a short time later. The witness could no longer see either the offender HAYDON or the co-offender DAVIS. The witness observed that the front registration number plate had been altered by using black electrical tape (see below and contained on a Form 1). 

The witness then observed the offender HAYDON in the rear yard of the adjoining semi rural property being the premises 1355 Ocean Drive, Lake Cathie. 

The offender HAYDON was observed near the rear shed and had a metal object in his pocket. The witness contacted Police. 

Entry was forced to the shed through a rear window. Once inside the shed a padlock and chain securing four motor bikes was cut. The motorbikes were 3 Honda CRF 250's and a Yamaha YZ 250. One of the Honda CRF 250 bikes was rolled towards the colourbond entry doors. A number of tools were also laying outside the shed. 

At about 10.25 am a police officer arrived at the premises. At the time the offender HAYDON was seen to be unscrewing the colourbond panels of the shed doors. On seeing the police officer, the offender HAYDON ran and jumped over the bonnet of a parked motor vehicle, back towards the Surfside Motel. The offender HAYDON was chased on foot by Police. The offender HAYDON then ran to the parked motor vehicle and drove away from the location at a high speed."" 

10The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Davis has engendered a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant. 








Argument 

11The applicant complained that for the offence contrary to s 113(2), he is to serve an effective non-parole period of 2 years 2 months whereas the co-offender's non-parole period was 13 months. The applicant's head sentence is 3 years 3 months as against 18 months for Davis. It was contended that this considerable difference in penalty is not justifiable on account of the Form 1 matters or for any other reason.

12The applicant submitted that the agreed facts did not differ in any material respect and the objective criminality of each offender was indistinguishable. The Judge had not endeavoured in his sentencing remarks to distinguish their objective criminality. The applicant argued that the disparity in the respective sentences could not be explained by the different subjective features or criminal histories of the offenders.

13It was contended that the sentence imposed upon Davis was not ameliorated by totality principles, as the Judge declined to accumulate his sentence upon either Davis's balance of parole or the period to be served on account of the revocation of the s 12 bond. By contrast, the applicant's sentence was accumulated upon an effective 13 months imprisonment for a break and enter offence committed later on the same day of the common offence, and that sentence was in turn entirely accumulated but for one month, upon various Local Court sentences for driving matters committed on the day of the break and enters. The sentence imposed in the Local Court amounted to an effective non-parole period of 14 months. Having regard to the successive accumulation of sentences imposed in both the Local and District Courts, the effective period that the applicant must serve in continuous custody is 5 years 5 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 4 months.

14Ms Francis, who appeared for the applicant, in oral submissions said that the applicant did not complain about the accumulation of the applicant's sentence, but the Judge's attention in his sentencing remarks to the facts of the offence of dangerous driving for which he had been sentenced to imprisonment in the Local Court, appeared to have ""clouded the proper assessment of the relative culpabilities confined to the facts in relation to the common offence"": T 7.45-50

15The Crown submitted that the agreed statement of facts clearly demonstrated that the applicant had played a more active role in the common offence. The Crown contended that it was not necessary for the Judge to endeavour to distinguish each offender's criminality, as their criminality was obviously and easily distinguishable from the agreed facts. When the Judge's remarks for each offender are considered in their entirety, it was clear that the Judge considered the applicant's objective criminality to have been greater than the co-offender's. The Crown pointed out that, when sentencing the applicant for the common offence, the Judge took into account the offences on the Form 1. There were also some differences in their subjective cases. The Crown argued that an effective non-parole period that is 13 months greater than that imposed on his co-offender was just and proper having regard to their respective roles and the Form 1 offences. As to the accumulation of sentence, the Judge was entitled to impose a period of custody that adequately and fairly reflected the totality of criminality involved in all of the offences.

Decision

16The appeal raises the issue of parity between the applicant's sentence and the sentence imposed on Davis, his co-offender for the aggravated break and enter contrary to s 113(2) Crimes Act. As Ms Francis pointed out, the applicant's head sentence of 3 years 3 months is more than 100 per cent greater than Davis's head sentence of 18 months and the non-parole period of 26 months is ""just shy"" of 100 per cent greater than the co-offender's non-parole period of 13 ½ months.



17A marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders of a degree or a kind which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance is required before appellate intervention: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. The applicant must show that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard the applicant's grievance as justified: R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251; R v Kollas and Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491. The plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36 said at [31]:

""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise."" (footnotes omitted)

18Any dissimilarity in the subjective cases of the co-offenders is slight and could not justify the difference in sentence. When the offence was committed, the applicant was 25 years old and Davis was 29 years old. Both offenders had unattractive prior criminal histories. The applicant was on parole for an offence of break, enter and steal whereas Davis committed the offence whilst subject to a s 12 bond for a charge of intimidation and malicious damage and was on parole for an offence of break, enter and steal. Both had pleaded guilty and 25 per cent discounts on sentence had been allowed for the pleas. The Judge did not make positive findings on the prospects of rehabilitation for either offender nor did he find special circumstances in either case.

19The applicant and Davis were parties to a joint criminal enterprise to break into and steal from the shed. Differences in the relative conduct of co-offenders may lead to greater objective criminality being reflected in a lengthier sentence. However, there are limits to which a differential role might impact upon the sentence of offenders who have agreed to perform a joint criminal enterprise because of the common purpose to commit the crime: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7 per Spigelman CJ at [166].

20The Judge did not characterise the role of either offender in his separate sentencing remarks nor did he refer to the principle of parity. Although it would have been preferable that his Honour had done so, it is plain from the agreed facts and his Honour's remarks that the applicant's level of culpability was more than that of Davis. The agreed facts identified the applicant as being ""observed near the rear shed"" and having a ""metal object in his pocket"". At the time police arrived, the applicant ""was seen to be unscrewing the colourbond panels of the shed doors"". On the other hand, Davis was not described as having taken an active role in the offending nor was he seen in the rear yard of the premises.

21During his evidence in the sentence proceedings, the applicant told the Judge that he ""had an idea that the bikes were there before"", that he got that idea from a trailer that he had seen ""in the side yard"" a couple of days before, that he broke into the premises by getting under the front door of the shed and the only reason he did not take the motorbikes or any other equipment was because the police arrived. When sentencing the applicant, the Judge said (ROS at 3):

""On inspection by police of the Nissan Patrol driven by the offender, it was evident that black electrical tape had been used in an attempt to alter the registration plates of the vehicle to avoid the vehicle being identified as that owned by the offender as being used in the offence at Lake Cathie.""

And (ROS at 4):

""These matters are serious and prevalent and attended to with organisation, as the offender had obviously recognited (sic) the area before in Lake Cathie and knew what he was after, and where it was to be stolen from, at the time of the commission of the offence. The offender having formed a view that the premises may well contain bikes because he had observed trailers, hence it was organised and pre-arranged and there is a degree of criminal activity involved in it and a matter of some aggravation.""

22Davis did not give evidence before the Judge. A submission was made on his behalf that ""he went along for the ride"". When sentencing Davis, the Judge did not refer to planning or organisation. There was no evidence that Davis had participated in a reconnaissance of the premises with the applicant nor had engaged in the preparation for the crime. The Judge observed that the Nissan Patrol, the registration number plate of which had been altered by the use of black electrical tape was owned by the applicant. The Judge accepted that Davis was easily led.

23It is evident that the Judge considered that the applicant played a more prominent role in the offending than Davis. In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to reflect that greater objective criminality in the applicant's sentence. As both offenders were participating in a crime they had agreed to commit, I do not think that the differentiation in their roles by itself justifies the significant difference in sentence. However, that was not the only matter of distinction between the applicant and Davis.

24When sentencing the applicant, the Judge took into account, as he was required to do three matters on the Form 1. Two of these matters were punishable by imprisonment. The agreed facts recounted that the offender stole a white Toyota Hilux from a premises at Rawdon Island, whilst the owner of the vehicle was on the roof of the premises painting at the time. He drove the vehicle to Wauchope where it was later found by police. This offence contrary to s 154A(1)(a) Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years. The other matter was an offence of receiving a stolen bullbar that had a previous number plate burnt into it which was unable to be removed or polished out. The applicant admitted purchasing the bullbar for $400 at a time he thought that it may have been stolen. The applicant returned the bullbar to the owner when he was asked to do so. This offence contrary to s 189 Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for 3 years.

25The Judge was entitled to increase the penalty for the common offence (the s 113(2) Crimes Act offence) because of the Form 1 offences. There were no matters on a Form 1 to be taken into account when Davis was sentenced.

26I am not persuaded that the Judge's assessment of the relative culpabilities of the co-offenders for the common offence was clouded by attention given to the dangerous driving offence. Both the applicant and Davis came before the Judge for sentence on 9 December 2010. His Honour recognised that a Magistrate had inappropriately committed the applicant for sentence for the offence of dangerous driving which he then remitted to the Local Court for sentence, together with two charges of driving whilst disqualified. The sentencing proceedings were adjourned to 15 December 2010. At the outset of the proceedings on the adjourned date, the Judge was informed that terms of imprisonment had been imposed in the Local Court for the offences that had been returned to the Magistrate. Although the facts of the offence of dangerous driving remained in the agreed statement of facts which the Judge recounted, his Honour made no other reference to this offence, other than to detail the sentences that had been imposed in the Local Court.

27Finally, I do not think that there is any merit in the applicant's complaint that the Judge accumulated his sentence for the common offence upon the sentence for the s 112(1)(a) offence and Local Court sentences for driving offences, whereas Davis's sentence was not accumulated either upon his balance of parole or the period to be served on account of the revocation of the s 12 bond. Davis neither stood for sentence for the s 112(1)(a) offence nor had he been sentenced for other offences in the Local Court. Different considerations of totality, accumulation and concurrence arose when the Judge came to sentence the applicant and his co-offender.

28All matters are not equal. In my view, the Judge made due allowance for the different roles which the co-offenders played in the common offence and the Form 1 matters that were singular to the applicant. These differences justify the disparity in sentence. The applicant has not shown that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard his grievance as justified.

29I would grant leave to appeal, but I would dismiss the appeal.

30The Court was informed that one of the Local Court sentences was corrected by the application of the ""slip rule"" in the Local Court so as to result in an effective non-parole period of 13 months which expired on 24 June 2011. This correction was made after the applicant had been sentenced in the District Court. 

31As a consequence of the correction, the concurrency of one month (from 25 June 2011 to 24 July 2011) that the Judge thought appropriate with the Local Court sentences has been extinguished. Both the applicant and the Crown ask that the applicant's sentence be backdated by one month so as to preserve the concurrency that had been intended. 

32It seems to me that the Court's powers under s 52(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act may be used to vary the non-parole period to correct this unintended result. To use s 52 in this facultative way assists the efficient administration of justice, rather than returning the sentences to the District Court for correction. The desired result may be achieved by bringing forward the commencement date of the non-parole period for the s 113(2) offence by one month. 






33Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

1.Leave to appeal granted. 

2.Appeal dismissed. 

3.The commencement date of the sentence imposed by McLoughlin DCJ for the aggravated break and enter contrary to s 113(2) Crimes Act be varied pursuant to s 52 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act so that the sentence is imprisonment for 3 years 3 months consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months commencing on 25 June 2012 and expiring on 24 August 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year 1 month expiring on 24 September 2015. 

34The applicant is eligible to be released on parole on 24 August 2014. 

35Button J: I agree with Price J.

		01 August 2012",2012-07-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707967,MJ v R [2012] NSWCCA 146,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Rothman J

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Rothman J

3ROTHMAN J: The applicant, MJ, appeals his conviction by a jury on 12 March 2008 of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age. The applicant was sentenced on 19 September 2008. The applicant does not seek leave to appeal the sentence.

4A notice of intention to appeal against conviction was first filed on 23 September 2008. That notice expired on 22 March 2009. A notice of appeal, dated 7 January 2011, was filed on 14 February 2011. The Crown opposes the extension of time necessary to proceed with the appeal, opposes leave to appeal and resists the appeal.

5The appeal expressly raises three grounds:

""Unreasonable verdict, which cannot be supported by the evidence;

The verdict was unreasonable because it depended on the word of the complainant who was a seven-year-old girl against the word of the accused and evidences general bias in relation to such issues;

There was no supportive [sic] evidence.""

6On the appeal, the applicant appeared for himself and drafted his own appeal. In essence, there are two grounds: unreasonable verdict and lack of corroboration. Taking a broad view of the submissions filed, the last mentioned ground included an argument that there has been a miscarriage of justice, because the Crown did not adduce relevant evidence about the weather and the optimal period for painting. This evidence, it is said, would support the applicant's reasons for not attending to his painting work at nearby premises on the day after the alleged offence.

Extension of time

7The Crown can point to no particular prejudice associated with the delay in filing the notice application for leave to appeal. 

8Notice of intention to appeal was given within the prescribed time and there was a delay of just under two years before the appeal was filed. Further, there was a delay between the compiling of the notice of appeal and its filing in Court.

9The applicant is unrepresented and the notice of appeal bears the hallmarks of being drafted without legal assistance. Notwithstanding the significant delay, in all the circumstances, including that the appeal involves a conviction appeal and the liberty of the applicant, an extension of time should be granted to allow the filing of the notice of appeal on 14 February 2011.

Facts

10The facts may be summarised briefly. The alleged offence occurred in February 2007. The complainant (KC) was 7 years old at that time. 

11At the time of the alleged offence, the mother of the complainant (SH) had a casual relationship with the applicant. The applicant was previously a family friend, who was known as ""Scruff"".

12The complainant alleged that one night, whilst she was asleep in her bedroom, she was woken because her vagina was being touched. She alleged that she opened her eyes and saw the applicant leaning over and touching her. 

13The complainant alleged that the incident lasted about 20 seconds. 

14The complainant said that at the time she did not say anything to the applicant because she did not want him to know that she had seen him.

15The complainant said this was the only occasion that an incident like this had occurred. 

16The applicant remained at the house the next day. The complainant said she had a conversation with the applicant that next day, during which he told her that the night before he had been checking if there were mosquitos tickling her. He told her not to tell anyone about this incident. 

17The complainant gave evidence that, later that day, she told her mother about the incident. 

18The applicant maintains that he had looked into the room on the evening of the alleged incident to check if there were mosquitoes on the ceiling. The applicant said he did this from the doorway.

19The applicant said that he remained at the house the next day because he was completing a painting job at a nearby house, however, on that day, the weather was too hot to paint and he was waiting for it to cool down. 

20The complainant's mother packed the applicant's belongings and left them on her front yard. This occurred whilst the complainant was at school and this was within a few days of the disclosure. When the applicant arrived at her house, she told him to take his belongings and leave. The complainant's mother did not explain to the applicant why she had taken this action. 

Proceedings below

21The Crown case below followed a fairly usual pattern. It is unnecessary to summarise all of the evidence. It is summarised in the Crown's summary with which no issue was taken. I will, however, summarise the more crucial parts.

The complainant's mother

22Formal evidence was given by the mother as to the age of the complainant. The mother also testified about the breakdown of her relationship with the complainant's father and the commencement and continuation of a casual relationship with the applicant, ""Scruff"".

23The applicant had been a family friend, whom the mother had known for most of her life. He was significantly older than the mother. The applicant stayed with the complainant's mother from time to time at the mother's home at Stuarts Point. Apart from these occasions, the complainant and her mother lived alone in the home.

24On Monday, 25 February 2007, the complainant's mother bathed the complainant and put her to bed. After the mother said goodnight to her, the complainant told her mother: ""I'm scared. I wanted to do something. I'm scared he might hear me.""

25The complainant's mother asked to whom she was referring to which the complainant replied: ""Scruff"". The mother enquired of what the complainant was scared and asked the complainant to tell her quietly.

26The complainant told her mother that the applicant had touched her ""down there"", pointing to her groin area. The mother enquired: ""Where did he touch you?"" to which the complainant answered, ""fanny"".

27On the afternoon prior to this conversation, according to the mother, the complainant had been playing with the applicant. The applicant had stayed overnight on the previous night and was at the house that day. In other words, on the mother's evidence, the complainant told her of the alleged assault approximately 24 hours after it had occurred. The applicant had stayed overnight and had been playing with the complainant between the time of the assault and the time that the complainant informed her mother of the assault.

28The mother recalled that the complainant and the applicant had been talking on the bridge over the pond in the front yard of the home between approximately 3.30pm and 4pm, at which time the mother had asked them to come inside because of the mosquitoes.

29After being told of the incident, the mother reassured the complainant and promised to protect her. The mother's evidence was that she went to bed around 11pm and tried to stay awake to see if she could catch the applicant acting inappropriately.

30At approximately 1am on 27 February 2007, the mother received a phone call informing her that a shed at her sister's house was on fire. The applicant drove the complainant and her mother to the sister's place and after spending some time there, drove them home.

31On returning home, the mother informed the applicant that she would be sleeping with the complainant. The mother stated that she was doing so because the complainant was scared, but did not inform the applicant as to the reason that the complainant was scared. The mother did sleep with the complainant for the remainder of that night.

32The next morning, the mother readied the complainant for school earlier than usual so that she could talk to the complainant away from the house. The mother told the complainant that because she had not seen what had happened she needed the complainant to tell her exactly what had happened.

33The complainant told the mother that the applicant had licked his finger and put it into her ""fanny"" and that it had not happened on any other occasion. The complainant told her that it had happened when all the lights were out and explained how it was she could identify the applicant. The complainant also explained to her mother that she was too scared, at the time, to say anything. The complainant, when asked, told her mother that he hurt her a little bit.

34After the foregoing conversation the mother left the child at school, went to her sister's place and told her sister what had happened. She did not stay long at her sister's house. Upon returning home, the mother found a note from the applicant saying that he had gone to help a friend with a car. The mother gathered the applicant's belongings and piled them at the front of the house. On the applicant's return, the mother told the applicant that she wanted him to take his things and get out of the house. She did not inform him as to the reason.

35A few days later, the complainant told her mother that the applicant had asked her not to tell her mother or anybody about what had happened. The complainant, in that conversation with her mother, said that the conversation with the applicant had occurred during the day following the alleged incident, when the two of them were at the pond. In that conversation, the complainant identified, after questioning, which finger the applicant had used to assault her.

36About a week after, the mother told the applicant to leave, she saw his car at a friend's house. She went in and asked to speak to the applicant. The applicant tried to cuddle the mother, who told him to take his hands off her. A conversation then occurred during which the mother was asked what was wrong and she told the applicant that he was ""gutless"" and that he knew what was wrong.

37The mother then told the applicant that she had a home movie that he could come over and watch with her. In fact, she had no such movie. In any event, the applicant replied that he could not go with her. The mother then said to the applicant: ""Well, I'll get it and come around and watch it with your friends. Maybe they'll understand. Because nobody seemed to know why we'd broken up.""

38The applicant informed the mother that he was catching a train to Sydney and that he would be back in two weeks to which the mother responded that they would sort it out then and, ""If I can't wait 'til then, I'll sort it out without you"". The mother then said to the applicant, as she was leaving in her car, ""You're fucked."" That was the last occasion that the mother saw the applicant.

The complainant's evidence

39The complainant's evidence was given by CCTV recording of her interview by police. During this interview, the complainant was in the presence of a Child Protection Case Worker. Her evidence in chief confirmed directly that which she had told her mother and which was repeated in the mother's evidence.

40After investigation by the trial judge, the complainant did not give evidence on oath. That evidence has been viewed for the purpose of these reasons. Further, the Court has examined the entire transcript of the proceedings. The complainant was cross-examined. That cross-examination did not significantly impact upon the complainant's version of the events; nor on the complainant's credit.

The applicant's evidence

41The applicant gave evidence denying the allegations of the complainant and maintained that denial in cross-examination.

42The applicant stated that he did not enter the complainant's room at any stage on the night in question. On the applicant's version, he went to the doorway, checked if there were mosquitoes on the ceiling and did not enter the room, go near the complainant or touch her.

43The applicant stated that the next day he stayed at the house because a contract painting job that he was to have performed, not too distant from the complainant's house, could not be done early in the day because it was too hot and the paint would have dried too quickly and peeled.

44While the applicant agreed with the evidence of the complainant's mother as to the break up in the relationship and the circumstances of his clothes being put in the front yard of the house, he maintained that the break was due to the complainant's mother wanting time out of the relationship. He also denied that he told the complainant's mother that he would be back in Stuart's Point in two weeks. In addition, the applicant asserted that the mother had left messages for him to come and help with renovations to her house.

Lack of ""supportive"" evidence

45As earlier stated there may be two aspects to this ground of appeal. The first of them is a repetition of the merits argument associated with the lack of corroboration. The second of them deals with the failure of the Crown to adduce evidence as to the weather and its effect on the applicant's capacity to complete his painting job. To the extent that this ground of appeal is the same as, or linked to, the lack of corroboration, it will be dealt with under that ground.

46The applicant was a painter. From time to time he undertook painting work. The fact, if it be a fact, that paint peels if applied in hot weather is neutral as to the occurrence of the events leading to the charge. The Court assumes that the assertion of the applicant in this regard is correct.

47Further, the Court can also assume that at least part of the motive for staying at the house on the day after the events leading to the charge was to be nearby the painting job so that he may complete it later in the day. Nevertheless, the applicant stayed at the house on the day in question; stayed over on the previous night; and that day had a conversation with the complainant on the bridge. Each of these independently corroborate the timing and circumstance, but not the content, of the conversation and the alleged events.

48The ""supportive"" evidence does not assist the applicant in his case and is marginally relevant to the charges before the Court. This ground of appeal fails.

Corroboration

49Formal corroboration is no longer essential in sexual assault matters or in relation to the evidence of children. If corroboration is being used in this technical sense, the lack of it is not a basis upon which a jury is not able to convict.

50Because the applicant is unrepresented, I will assume that corroboration is used not only in its technical sense but also in its ordinary meaning. As the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission makes clear significant research has been undertaken which discloses that, ""the evidence of children is not inherently less reliable than that of adults"" (ALRC Report 102 at [18.64]).

51The terms of s 165A of the Evidence Act 1995 prohibit a warning to a jury based on the unreliability of children's evidence as a class. In any event, an examination of the recording of the complainant's evidence does not suggest that the evidence is, in any sense, unreliable.

52Moreover, the complainant's relatively immediate complaint to her mother, while not corroborating, in the technical or common law sense, supported her version of the events. By that I refer to the fact that there has been no substantial or significant delay in the making of a complaint. In this case, there is no danger that the complainant's ""fantasy about sexual matters"" has become a ""conviction of reality"", because the complaint was made, in a very real sense, on the first opportunity so to do: compare Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 100-101, per Deane J and at 107, per McHugh J.

53No other matter raised under this ground is anything more than a submission that the verdict was unreasonable, with which I will now deal.

Unreasonable verdict

54The manner in which this Court approaches the task of determining whether a verdict is unreasonable is now well settled. The principles are embodied in the judgments of the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, and R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 85 ALJR 8. In M v R, at 493, the High Court said:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 


55At 494-495, the joint judgment also said:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt..."" 

56The focus must be on an examination of the evidence and the unreasonableness of the verdict. That task is not concluded by a determination that there is evidence upon which a jury could have convicted, but whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt. This will be answered in the affirmative if the appellate court has a reasonable doubt that cannot be answered by paying regard to the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence. The focus is on the expression ""beyond reasonable doubt"", and a reasonable doubt experienced by an appellate court will generally be a doubt which a jury ought to have experienced.

57Essentially, the applicant refers to 10 numbered parts of the transcript to submit that the complainant's evidence is unreliable and the jury should have had a reasonable doubt. I do not accept this submission. The evidence upon which the applicant relies at best, from his perspective, discloses imprecision in wording. It does not disclose doubt in the events that occurred.

58Further, the trial judge directed the jury, most appropriately, as to how to deal with any differences they perceived in her evidence. There is no complaint about the summing up or the directions to the jury.

59The burden of proof at trial remained with the Crown. It was the Crown's burden to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the offence of which the complainant gave evidence. In that regard, it was necessary for the jury to believe the evidence of the complainant and not to believe the evidence of the applicant.

60Many criminal cases depend upon which of two versions of events is accepted, often in circumstances where it is the word of the alleged victim against the word of the alleged offender. The choice by a jury of one witness's evidence as believable and another witness's evidence as unbelievable, of itself, and without independent evidence or some other factor affecting that assessment, cannot be a basis upon which a jury's verdict is necessarily rendered unreasonable.

61As earlier stated, I have viewed the evidence of the complainant. I have also read the evidence of the mother and the applicant, and the other evidence in the proceedings. I have no reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the verdict or the guilt of the applicant.

Conclusion

62Each of the grounds of appeal must fail. For the foregoing reasons, I propose the following orders:

1. Extension of time granted so as to allow the filing of the notice of appeal;
2. Leave to appeal granted;
3. Appeal dismissed.

		04 July 2012",2012-07-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707969,Richard Warren James CONNELLY v R [2012] NSWCCA 144,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Rothman J

3ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Richard Connelly, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court for the offence of recruiting another to carry out a criminal activity contrary to s 351A of the Crimes Act 1900. Mr Connelly had sought to procure someone to render the potential victim blind and deaf, because the victim had provided information to the police that led to Mr Connelly being charged with manufacturing drugs.

4The offence carried a maximum penalty of 7 years' imprisonment and may be prosecuted summarily: Schedule 1, Table 1 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Mr Connelly was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years, 2 months and 22 days as part of a head sentence of 2 years, 11 months and 21 days (hereinafter ""the non-parole period"" and ""the head sentence"" respectively, and overall as ""the sentence"").

5The District Court imposed the sentence on 16 March 2011 and the sentence commenced on 16 December 2010 (i.e. the sentence was backdated three months). At the time that he was sentenced, Mr Connelly was serving a sentence (hereinafter ""the earlier sentence"") imposed for an earlier offence (hereinafter ""the earlier offence""), being a sentence of imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months as part of a head sentence of 3 years, commencing on 17 June 2009.

6The offence that gave rise to the sentence was committed in June 2009 while Mr Connelly was on bail pending commencement of the earlier sentence. The non-parole period for the earlier sentence concluded on 16 December 2010 and Mr Connelly had been refused parole. Therefore, he was still imprisoned at 16 March 2011, when the sentence was imposed.

7The relevant sentences that had been imposed are best represented by the following table:

Ground of appeal

8The applicant raises only one ground of appeal:

""The sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances and imposed a sentence which failed to give proper effects [sic] to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""

9In reality, this ground of appeal raises some interlocking issues and, in particular, the principle of totality and the effect of accumulation of sentences on the fixing of an appropriate non-parole period.

Facts

10The applicant was engaged in manufacturing methylamphetamine and was arrested in relation to that offence in November 2006, due in part to information provided to the police by the prospective victim of the later offence.

11The applicant was released on bail on 19 January 2007. 

12On 11 June 2009, while the applicant was still on bail, information was provided to the police by two of the applicant's associates and a controlled operation began. 

13An undercover police operative, ""Sam"", met the applicant in the presence of the two associates. 

14""Sam"" was told by the applicant words to the effect that the applicant wanted ""Sam"" to make the prospective victim blind and deaf so that ""he'll suffer for a long time"" because ""you go crazy in your own head if you can't see and you can't hear"". 

15The applicant gave ""Sam"" the victim's name and the suburb in which he lived, and said he would try and get a photograph for him. ""Sam"" arranged to collect the applicant and go with him to a methadone clinic at St Marys so that the applicant could identify the victim. 

16The applicant agreed to pay ""Sam"" in methylamphetamine. 

17The following Tuesday, being 28 July 2009, ""Sam"" and the applicant drove to the methadone clinic at St Marys. While waiting for the victim, they had a further discussion about the applicant's desires for the victim to be blinded and deafened. They also discussed payment for ""Sam"" to do these acts. 

18The victim did not attend the clinic and so the two left. The applicant took no further steps in relation to this offence.

The submissions of the parties

19The applicant submits that the non-parole period imposed constituted 75 percent of the total term of sentence. However, the sentence, as already stated, was wholly cumulative on a previous sentence imposed, resulting in an overall non-parole period of approximately 83 percent. The applicant seeks a reduction in the non-parole period.

20The applicant submits that his Honour erred in not finding special circumstances (on the basis of the applicant's rehabilitation needs and the accumulation of the sentence) because:

(a)Where, as in this case, accumulation has taken place, the sentencing judge should provide reasons for an increase in the ratio of the non-parole period to the remainder of the sentence: R v Dunn [2007] NSWCCA 312.

(b)The absence of express reference by the sentencing judge to special circumstances indicates that his Honour may have overlooked giving appropriate focus to the statutory ratio: Briggs v R [2010] NSWCCA 250.

21Essentially, the Crown submits that it was within his Honour's discretion to decline to find special circumstances: see, for example, Ha v R [2010] NSWCCA 83.

22Further, in relation to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the Crown submits that the provision does not prohibit the imposition of a non-parole period exceeding the ratio of 3:1, whether in relation to a single sentence or accumulated sentences. Rather, the Crown suggests that s 44 strictly relates to the relationship between the period of full-time custody and the period on parole for each particular offence: Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49; Musgrove v R [2007] NSWCCA 21.

23The Crown submits that, even though accumulation is a recognised basis for finding special circumstances, it is not mandatory for a sentencing judge to make such a finding: Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213. In this case, the sentencing judge was not asked to find special circumstances based upon accumulation and thus, the Crown submits, the Court should not interfere with the outcome.

24Moreover, the Crown submits that, in the event that this Court finds error, no lesser sentence is warranted and, nevertheless, the appeal should be dismissed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Consideration

25As earlier stated, underpinning the criticism of the sentence imposed is the principle of totality, as it applies to the task of imposing a sentence at a time when an offender is already in custody.

26The more orthodox approach when sentencing an offender, who is already serving a sentence, is for the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that would have been likely to have been imposed if the offender had committed all of the offences in one jurisdiction and had been sentenced at one time. The requirement remains that each individual sentence reflects the criminality of the offence to which it relates and the overall sentence reflects the total criminality of the crimes committed: Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610.

27The charging of two or more offences that involve common elements requires the court to ensure that there is no double punishment for the one offending course of conduct: Pearce at [40]. A commonsense approach to the issue must be taken: Pearce at [42].

28Only after fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence, should a sentencing judge consider questions of accumulation and concurrency and questions of totality: Pearce at [45]. The foregoing principles apply even where there is a significant delay between the different sentencing exercises and even where there are different jurisdictions or judges involved: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59.

29The sentencing discretion must be exercised judicially and cannot be calculated arithmetically: Pearce at [46]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. There is, therefore, no single correct answer. It is always the task of the sentencing judge to apply the general sentencing principles to fix an appropriate head sentence and an appropriate period during which the offender is eligible for parole, bearing in mind the often disparate goals of punishment, protection of society, deterrence of the offender and others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and rehabilitation: s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476.

30Further, it is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge whether the judge considers there are special circumstances that warrant the fixing of a greater proportion of the sentence as the period for which an offender is eligible for parole and the proportion that the legislature has prescribed: s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

31The prescription in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relates to individual sentences and does not preclude the fixing of a ratio greater than 3:1: see Musgrove and Barrett.

32Accumulation of sentences has an arithmetic effect on the proportion. Where, as here, a sentencing judge has, by fixing a sentence that reflects the 3:1 ratio, implemented an overall sentence that reflects a greater than 3:1 ratio without otherwise indicating such an intention, the Court will be more astute in assuming that the issue has been overlooked. In my view, in this case, it has been overlooked or alternatively, the sentencing judge has not applied the totality principle.

33The offence is serious. The sentence needs to reflect that seriousness. Yet no complaint is made by the Crown that the head sentence is inadequate. In my view, the head sentence is adequate in all of the circumstances, but the length of potential parole is inadequate to enable, subject to the satisfaction of the NSW State Parole Authority, an appropriate period for rehabilitation and assimilation into the community.

34I do not propose to alter the head sentence, and I take the view that the overall potential parole period ought to reflect the ratio that the sentencing judge thought was appropriate, namely, 3:1. The sentencing judge for the earlier offence fixed a lower ratio, namely, 1:1.

35However, I do not consider it appropriate to fix a sentence by reference to a number of days. It is far better to round any sentence that may be imposed. Other than rounding the days, I would not interfere with the head sentence imposed and would implement a ratio for the non-parole period of 3:1.

36For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the Court make the following orders:

(1) Leave to appeal granted;
(2) The sentence imposed by the District Court on Richard Connelly on 16 March 2011 be quashed and, in lieu thereof, he be sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and nine months commencing 16 December 2010 and concluding 15 September 2012 with a remainder of term of 14 months, concluding 15 November 2013.

2707972,Satuala Nanai v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 141,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with McDougall J. 
2McDOUGALL J:   The applicant seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years, imposed by his Honour Judge Finnane QC on 12 September 2010.  
3The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (count 1) and one count of possessing an unauthorised pistol contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (count 2).  Section 25(1) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and s 7(1) carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  On each count his Honour took into consideration other ""Form 1"" offences (see s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).  In relation to count 1, his Honour took into consideration an offence of goods in custody, contrary to s 527C of the Crimes Act 1900.  This offence carries a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment.  In relation to count 2, his Honour took into account one offence of possess an unauthorised weapon, also contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, and one offence of possess unauthorised ammunition in contravention of s 65(3) of the Firearms Act.  The Form 1 offences on count 2 carry maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment and 50 penalty units respectively. 
4A sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years, to date from 6 December 2008, was imposed for count 1.  A sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, to date from 6 December 2011, was imposed for count 2.
5The grounds of appeal relied upon (or that would be relied upon if leave were granted) were stated as: 
(1)Ground 1: the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the Form 1 offences when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced; 
(2)Ground 2: the sentence for count 2 was manifestly excessive; 
(3)Ground 3: the total sentence was manifestly excessive; and 
(4)Ground 4: the sentencing judge erred in engaging in a two-stage approach when sentencing the applicant. 
6Ground 1 was not pressed on the hearing of the application for leave to appeal. The background facts
7The Crown and the applicant put before Finnane DCJ an agreed statement of facts.  The basic facts to be drawn from that document may be stated as follows: 
(1)In 2001, the applicant was convicted of the manslaughter of two men.  The applicant, together with a number of other men, had participated in an assault on the victims.  Each victim was shot a number of times.  The applicant was sentenced in aggregate to 9 years imprisonment, with an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years.  He was released on parole on 12 December 2005.  He was on parole when he committed the offences that are now in question.  He served the balance of his sentence, from 6 August 2008 to 12 March 2009, whilst he was remanded in custody for the present offences.  
(2)In May 2008, the applicant was stopped whilst driving a motor vehicle in Edgecliff.  He was searched.  Police found $6,475.00.  That is the subject of the charge of goods in custody on the Form 1 associated with count 1.  
(3)Between 15 and 17 July 2008, police lawfully intercepted telephone conversations in which the applicant arranged to supply some 3,000 pills containing an unspecified prohibited drug.  That is the conduct that gave rise to count 1.  
(4)On 17 July 2008, the applicant was lawfully recorded discussing the use of a firearm.  Later conversations, concerning ammunition and a test firing session, were also recorded.  The applicant was arrested on 6 August 2008.  His home was searched.  A .22 calibre Bersa pistol was located.  That is the subject of count 2.  There were also found a silencer fitting the pistol and some 44 rounds of ammunition.  Those are the Form 1 offences attaching to count 2. 
(5)The applicant pleaded guilty at Central Local Court, and asked for the Form 1 offences to be taken into account.  He was remanded in custody for sentence.  
The remarks on sentence
8The sentencing Judge set out the matters to which I have referred.  He noted that the applicant was entitled to the maximum discount on sentence, 25%, because of his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.  He then turned, in a way that is not the subject of criticism, to the facts underlying the two charges.  His Honour then turned to subjective factors, including the applicant's previous criminal record (which, his Honour said, ""apart from the manslaughter charges, is insignificant"") and other matters.  Again, that aspect of his Honour's remarks is not the subject of criticism. 
9His Honour then turned to the sentencing process.  He said (remarks on sentence, page 8):
Because both these offences carry a standard non-parole period, I am required to engage in a two-part process in evaluating each offence.  I have to determine whether the offence in each case is a mid-range offence, is less than mid range or is greater than mid range.  Because he has pleaded guilty I do not have to impose the standard non-parole period for the first count of ten years and the second of three, but I must continually keep both those standard non-parole periods in mind as a guidepost just as I must take into account the maximum penalty in each case as a guidepost. 
In relation to each matter I also have to take into account in determining the seriousness of the offence and whether it is mid range or not, the fact that he has asked me to take into account other matters on the Form 1. 
10It is what his Honour said in the first of those paragraphs that gives rise to ground 4.  It is what his Honour said in the second of those paragraphs that had given rise to the (now abandoned) ground 1.  All that need be said is that his Honour concluded (in my opinion, correctly) that in relation to count 2:
... the two Form 1 matters do add to the seriousness of the matter because they show that he had not only a pistol in his possession but he had a silencer, and he had ammunition. 
11As to count 1, the sentencing Judge concluded that it was a serious offence but not a midrange offence.  As to count 2, his Honour concluded that it was a midrange offence.  He said (remarks on sentence, page 10): 
... I think it is a very serious matter for someone to have a working pistol with ammunition and a silencer.  The only reason anyone would have such weapons in his possession is to use them for some criminal activity.  
12His Honour then referred to a submission that the applicant had the pistol, ammunition and silencer because he was paranoid, and because he wished to protect himself.  His Honour said, again in my view correctly, that that was ""not to the point"".  He continued (remarks on sentence, page 10): 
Our courts have to take action to demonstrate to the public at large that we do not accept the entitlement of people to have unauthorised weapons in their possession, particularly weapons like this that can be held only for one purpose, and that is for serious criminal activity.  
13In respect of count 1, his Honour, having referred to the Form 1 matter, said (remarks on sentence, pages 9-10): 
I intend to impose a four year non-parole period with a total sentence of 6 years.  That may appear to be very harsh, particularly on someone who seems to be making serious endeavours to do something for the future, but in determining that four years I have reduced the sentence that I might well have imposed by taking into account the fact that he is a drug addict and that he is making serious endeavours to rid himself of his addiction, and that he has been a person of good behaviour.  
14In respect of count 2, his Honour said (remarks on sentence, pages 10-11): 
Taking into account all the matters of a subjective nature in his favour - and I have referred to them already - taking into account the plea of guilty, and the maximum discount, I have decided nonetheless to impose on him the standard non-parole period of three years with a head sentence of seven years.  
15His Honour then considered the questions of from when the sentences should date, and of concurrency (or accumulation).  He decided that it would be too harsh on the applicant to date the sentences from 12 March 2009 (when the previous parole period expired), and instead backdated the sentence on count 1 to commence on 6 December 2008.  It followed that the non-parole period, of four years, would continue through to 5 December 2012.  In relation to term 2, his Honour determined that the sentence should commence from 6 December 2011.  The effect is that there was one year of concurrency and (as to the non-parole periods) two years of accumulation.  
Ground 2: the sentence for count 2 is manifestly excessive
16Counsel for the applicant accepted that the non-parole period of 3 years ""was open"".  (That was a wise position to adopt; in my view, it could be said that the non-parole period imposed was lenient in all the circumstances.)  However, counsel submitted, the overall term of 7 years was manifestly excessively.  
17Counsel submitted that the head sentence of 7 years, after a discount of 25% for the early plea of guilty, reflected a ""starting point"" of 9 years and 3 months.  That, he submitted, was too high.  He referred to: 
(1)decisions of this court, including Do v R [2010] NSWCCA 182; and 
(2)sentencing statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales.
18I start with the decision in Do.  The applicant Do was charged with possessing a prohibited pistol, and possessing an unregistered firearm.  The facts of that case were serious, and the subjective factors related to the applicant were not impressive.  I set out paras [7], [16] and [17] of the reasons of Hislop J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Barr AJ agreed) to make good that point: 
[7]A search of the vehicle and its occupants revealed the presence of a balaclava and three white gloves. One occupant (Nguyen) had a machete with a 50 cm blade secreted in his pants. A black Parabellum pistol containing a magazine with 10 live rounds of ammunition was located in the foot well where one occupant (Chompeay) had been sitting. A 32 calibre Beretta pistol was located in the foot well area on the driver's side where the applicant had been sitting. It contained a magazine with two live rounds of ammunition. A plastic bag containing 0.27 grams of methylamphetamine was located in his pocket. The occupant Tran had a Taser-type device, in working order, on his person and a copper coloured bullet in his pocket. A .25 calibre pistol with a magazine with six live rounds was found in the foot well area where Tran had been sitting. The pistols were prohibited and unregistered. The occupants had no licences or permits in respect of them. Numerous items of correspondence in the name of the applicant were located in the glovebox of the vehicle.
...
[16]The applicant's record showed that he had been convicted of a number of types of different offences including illegal use of a motor vehicle, self administer prohibited drug, break enter and steal, armed robbery, steal motor vehicle, possess firearm without licence, resist officer, enter inclosed lands, behave in an offensive manner, supply prohibited drug, possess unauthorised firearm, possess prohibited drug and goods in custody. He has served previous terms of imprisonment.
[17]At the time of the offence the applicant was on conditional liberty, being on parole, having been sentenced to four years imprisonment with a 15 month non parole period for drug supply, and a concurrent ten month fixed term for possession of an unauthorised firearm, with the sentences commencing on 25 June 2005. He was released to parole on 24 September 2006. As a result of the subject offences, the parole was revoked effective as of the date of his arrest, 10 June 2008, and he was ordered to serve the balance of parole of one year 15 days, which expired on 24 June 2009.
19Hislop J said at [23] that the objective circumstances of the offence was such as to place it significantly above the middle range of objective seriousness.  Thus, his Honour said, the standard non-parole period was of limited relevance, and the principal relevant factor in determining the sentence was the maximum penalty, 14 years imprisonment.  
20Counsel for the applicant submitted, correctly, that in this case, the sentencing Judge had concluded that count 2, viewed objectively, was ""a midrange offence"". 
21In my view, the sentencing Judge was correct when he described count 2 as objectively, ""a midrange offence"".  The applicant had possession of a pistol, a silencer adapted for it, and live ammunition.  He had been overheard arranging to buy more powerful ammunition, and to conduct a test firing.  It was open to the sentencing Judge to infer that these preparations were not being undertaken simply to while away the time between drug deals.  
22In my view, the circumstance of the present matter are distinguishable, in a very significant respect, from the circumstances in Do.  The applicant Do undoubtedly had a serious criminal history.  It involved, among many other things, the illegal possession of a firearm and armed robbery (whether or not that armed robbery was conducted using firearms is not disclosed).  Both the range and the quantity of weapons found, and the circumstances in which they were found, supported the inference that Do and his companions intended to use the weapons for criminal purposes.  But, so far as the facts show, Do had not been convicted of any offence of wounding or killing, whether involving the use of firearms or otherwise.  
23By contrast, in this case, that was the position of the applicant; and as I have now said several times, he was on parole, for those very offences, when he committed the present offences. 
24In my view, that distinction is fundamental.  It leads necessarily to the conclusion that the outcome in Do cannot be regarded as providing any useful guide to an appropriate outcome in the present case. 
25It is not necessary to go to the other decisions on which counsel for the applicant relied, since they were further remote from the facts in this case, and in my view offer nothing by way of relevant guidance. 
26I turn to the statistics.  They dealt with sentences from July 2004 to June 2011 in ""higher courts"".  The median term of imprisonment (including consecutive and non-consecutive terms) was 36 months, representing 37% of all the sentences collated in the statistics.  The figures showed what appears to be only one head sentence of 7 years, presumably that imposed on the applicant, and no head sentences of a longer duration.  
27As to non-parole periods (for non-consecutive terms only), the statistics showed a median term of 18 months, representing 40% of the sentences collated.  There appear to have been four cases in which a non-parole period of 3 years was specified, and 2 in which a higher non-parole period was specified.  
28It may be accepted that the statistics could be interpreted to show that the head sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge falls at the extreme range of severity for all the recorded sentences comprised in the statistics.  However, the statistics do not show, and this court has no way of knowing otherwise, the underlying facts of any of the other offences.  For example, there is no indication as to what (if any) other criminal activity the various offenders were engaged in at the time of their convictions on firearms offences.  Their previous criminal histories are not known.  In particular, and in my view of crucial significance, it is not known whether or not they had been involved in unlawful killings using firearms at some earlier time, nor whether they were, at the time of commission of the offence for which the sentence is recorded in the statistics, on parole for such a crime.  
29Thus, in my view, the statistics are of no utility in demonstrating that, in the present case and having regard to the facts of the present case, the sentence imposed was excessive, let alone manifestly so.     
30It is necessary to look at the sentences overall.  That overall view requires a recognition that, for the two offences and taking into account the form 1 offences, there was an aggregate head sentence of 10 years with an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years, and that the applicant received some leniency by the backdating of the commencement of the sentences to a time when the applicant was serving out the balance of his previous sentences.
31The sentencing Judge was required to take into account the need to mark the community's disapprobation of the serious crimes to which the applicant had pleaded guilty.  His Honour was required to have regard to the need (which his Honour stressed) to denounce firearms offences, and (another matter stressed by his Honour) to the importance of personal deterrence.  Both those factors have particular resonance in this case because of the offences for which the applicant was on parole at the time of commission of the subject offences.  
32The sentencing Judge was entitled to infer that the previous sentence imposed on and served by the applicant had not served any real rehabilitative function.  Nor had it appeared to deter him from engaging in further criminal behaviour, of a most serious kind.  
33The question is whether, in all the circumstances, the sentences are unreasonable or plainly unjust.  In my view, when all the circumstances are taken into account, they are not.  In addition to the factors to which I have referred, it is necessary to bear in mind (in particular) the two Form 1 offences associated with count 2.  The facts underlying count 2 show that the applicant possessed a pistol.  The facts underlying the offences give rise to the inference that he intended to use it, if necessary, in connection with the criminal enterprise disclosed by the facts underlying count 1. 
34Accepting, as the sentencing Judge did, the subjective circumstances disclosed (and as I have said, his Honour referred to them in detail), nonetheless, in my view, it cannot be said that the sentences, in aggregate, were unreasonable, or plainly unjust. 
Ground 3: accumulation 
35Effectively, the sentencing Judge accumulated the sentences by 3 years.  Counsel for the applicant accepted that some accumulation was necessary.  He postulated a range of 1 ½ to 2 years. 
36Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing Judge had not referred to the principle of totality, and, accordingly, that this court should conclude that his Honour had overlooked, or misapplied, that principle.  Thus, even accepting (as counsel did accept) that the decision to accumulate is discretionary, it was submitted that the discretion miscarried to a point where this court should intervene.  
37The sentencing Judge did not in terms refer to the principle of totality.  However, it is clear, from the way in which he considered the question of concurrency / accumulation, that his Honour had that principle in mind.  His Honour was very much aware, and indeed stated, the overall effect of the sentences that he proposed to impose and the extent to which he proposed to make them cumulative.  There was no other reason for his Honour to backdate the sentence on count 1 to the extent that he did, except to accommodate the concept of totality.  
38Each of the offences was serious.  Further, although there was an underlying factual relationship between them, they were discrete offences.  This was not a case where (for example) a sentence on count 1 would reflect the criminality both of that offence and of the conduct involved in count 2.  On the contrary, it was necessary, to reflect the discrete and differing criminality shown by the underlying facts, to impose a substantial cumulative period. 
39As Howie J said in Cahyadi v R (2006) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27], the issue is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence.  The extent of concurrency reflects the extend to which this question can be answered ""yes"".  
40The sentencing Judge did not in terms explain why it was that the sentence on count 1 could not properly comprehend and reflect the criminality for the offence in count 2.  Nonetheless, it is apparent from his Honour's careful recitation of the facts that he was well aware of this point.  Further, that recitation of the facts makes it plain why, as I have said, there was a need for accumulation.  
41The only relevant relationship between the underlying facts of the two offences was that, as I have said, it was clearly open to infer that the applicant had procured the pistol for use, should it prove necessary, in his business of supplying prohibited drugs.  But it is possible to supply prohibited drugs without arms; and a pistol may be used for many purposes other than that of illegitimate enforcement of an unlawful business activity.  In my view, the degree of relationship between the two offences is properly reflected in the extent to which the sentencing Judge made the sentences concurrent.   
42It follows, in my view, that the degree of accumulation imposed by the sentencing Judge was not excessive.  On the contrary, I think, the fact that his Honour was prepared to allow a year of concurrency was another instance of leniency towards the applicant: influenced, no doubt, by the subjective factors to which, clearly, his Honour paid careful regard.  
Ground 4: the two-stage approach 
43It is plain that the approach the sentencing Judge said he would take is inconsistent with the principles explained in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26] and following.  
44However, counsel for the applicant did not submit that this error of (stated) approach was of itself productive of error in the outcome.  Rather, his submission was that error in the outcome was demonstrated by reason of the matters addressed under grounds 2 and 3.  
45In my view, it is clear that, although the sentencing Judge stated that he proposed to engage in a two-stage process of assessment, what he did in fact was something else. As was emphasised in R v Zreika [2012] NSWCCA 44, it is necessary to read as a whole all the relevant comments of the sentencing Judge.  In this case, the remarks on sentence make it plain that on each count, the sentencing Judge had regard to the maximum sentence provided and to the standard non-parole period as guides available for the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  That is apparent from the first of the paragraphs quoted at [9] above.  That approach does not betray error.  On the contrary, in my view, it demonstrates that the sentencing Judge did engage in the process of instinctive synthesis for which the sentencing exercise called, guided (as properly he might be) by both the maximum available penalty and the standard non-parole period for each offence.  
46In undertaking that process, the sentencing Judge had regard to relevant matters including the objective seriousness of the offences charged, the objective circumstances, the subjective circumstances and the significant (in the case of count 2) Form 2 offences that were taken into account.  
47Counsel for the applicant submitted that it appears, from the paragraphs that I have quoted at [9] above, that, on each count, it was the standard non-parole period that was the ""driver"" of the sentencing decision.  I do not agree.  In my view, the summary given by the sentencing Judge, in relation to count 2, set out at [14] above, makes it clear that this was not the case.  
48In short, reading the remarks on sentence in their entirety, I do not accept that the apparent error of approach (as it has since been shown to be) was productive of any error in outcome.  On the contrary, in my view, the outcome was if anything favourable to the applicant, in the sense that it exhibited a degree of leniency over and above that which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, he was entitled to expect.  
49To put it another way: if the sentencing Judge did allow himself to be misled by undue focus on the standard non-parole period for count 2, the consequence was that he imposed a non-parole period which could not be regarded as reaching the outer limit of severity appropriate in a case such as this.   
Conclusion 
50In my view, each of the grounds of challenge to the sentences imposed by the sentencing Judge fails.  However, in my view, the question raised by ground 4 does raise a point of some significance.  Since my decision on ground 4 takes into account my conclusion on grounds 2 and 3, I think it appropriate to grant leave to appeal against sentence, but to dismiss the appeal. 
51Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
(1)grant leave to appeal.  
(2)Order that the appeal be dismissed. 52ADAMSON J:  I agree with McDougall J.

2707974,ROSS v R [2012] NSWCCA 161,"Judgment

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 

2PRICE J: David Ross seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him on 3 March 2011 in the District Court. He had entered a plea of guilty to a charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm to Kenneth Wheatley on 14 October 2009 contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900. After allowing a 10 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 6 months consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months with a balance of term of 1 year 2 months. 

3The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act is imprisonment for 10 years. A standard non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment has been prescribed. 

4The facts of the offence may be stated briefly. The applicant and Mr Wheatley, lived close by each other and had a disagreement over a kitten and a dog. During the disagreement, the applicant picked up a piece of wood about a metre long and hit Mr Wheatley, who had turned around to walk to his house, with the piece of wood on the left side of the back. As Mr Wheatley turned around, he was struck again with the piece of wood to the elbow. The applicant swung the piece of wood once more, but Mr Wheatley grabbed hold of it, a struggle ensued and the applicant was pushed away. As a result of the blow to the back, Mr Wheatley suffered internal injuries. He spent about a month in hospital and his spleen was removed. The operation to remove the spleen resulted in substantial scarring on the stomach area that caused discomfort. The sentencing judge observed (ROS p 7):

""The discomfort from the scarring is probably, I am sure, of minor consequence compared to the other ongoing difficulty of Mr Wheatley having to live for the rest of his life without a spleen and the consequences for him of that. I note the victim impact statement, that there is still some ongoing anxiety and trauma associated.""

5The applicant was 45 years old at the time of the commission of the offence. A Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report was before the sentencing judge that revealed that the applicant had a lengthy history of contact with the Probation and Parole Service dating back to 1981. He had used cannabis for some 30 years and commenced using heroin at the age of 22. He had been on the methadone program since 1996 and claimed to have not used heroin for the past 8 years. Drug Health Services confirmed that he was a compliant methadone patient. The applicant had been in receipt of sickness benefits since 2006. 

6The applicant's prior criminal history as an adult disclosed offences involving dishonesty and prohibited drugs, however, in May 2002 he was sentenced to imprisonment for common assault and two counts of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. 

7A report dated 3 October 2010 from Mr W John Taylor, clinical forensic psychologist, was tendered. Mr Taylor noted that the applicant continued to have a problem with heroin abuse. Although the applicant had been on the methadone program, he had used heroin about once a month. Mr Taylor considered that the results of actuarial analysis indicated that the applicant had ""a moderate to high-moderate risk of general recidivism and a moderate risk of violent recidivism."" 

8The sentencing judge accepted that any previous convictions that involved matters of violence were some time ago and there were ""no matters of a serious or worrying personal violence nature ... which would necessarily aggravate the seriousness of this matter"" (ROS p 8). Her Honour found that the offence was not pre-meditated and, notwithstanding that a substantial weapon was used, it was not a matter ""where one would necessarily think that a single blow would result in the substantial injuries..."" (ROS p 9). Her Honour was unable to find that the applicant had expressed remorse. As to prospects of rehabilitation, her Honour observed that the applicant did not appear to be properly motivated to address his substance abuse problem. 

9The sentencing judge determined that the objective seriousness of the offence was at the middle range. Her Honour said that there was nothing upon which she could find special circumstances. 

The appeal 

10The sole ground of appeal is that: 

""Her Honour the Sentencing Judge erred in her approach to Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and a lesser sentence is warranted in law."" 

11The sentence was imposed prior to the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The focus of the applicant's complaint of error are her Honour's remarks on sentence that (ROS p 9):

""This particular offence...carries with it a standard non-parole period. Way's case directs me how I must treat that matter and I will shortly assess the objective seriousness of the offence but in doing so the Court must take into account whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period and answering that question by considering firstly the objective seriousness of the offence considered in the light of the facts which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls in mid-range of seriousness for an offence of this kind. 

The Court must also take into account the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation as set out in the various subsections of s 21A. Whatever the case in that regard, the considerations referred to may similarly provide a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period.""

12In making those remarks, the sentencing judge was endeavouring to follow the approach mandated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, before the judgment in Muldrock, where the High Court said at [25]:

""The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the mid range of objective seriousness.""

13The Crown accepts that those passages of her Honour's remarks on sentence do not comply with the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock. 

14The applicant contends that the consequence of the error was that too much emphasis was placed by the sentencing judge on the standard non-parole period, rather than it being used as a guide or check, along with the maximum penalty. The applicant points out that the non-parole period imposed was 83 per cent of the standard non-parole period and argues that there was no warrant for a sentence that fell within that range. Although accepting that the injuries to Mr Wheatley were serious, the applicant submits that they were occasioned by a single (one handed) blow to the back with a blunt piece of wood that did not immediately disable Mr Wheatley. Furthermore, her Honour recognised that the injuries occasioned were not necessarily to have been expected from a single blow of the type in the present case. The applicant argues that his record was not such as to call for any additional element of specific deterrence. The sentence is said to be too high and a lesser sentence is warranted. 

15The Crown submits that although the sentencing judge's approach is now at odds with Muldrock, her conclusions with respect to the objective seriousness of the offence were open to her, as was the sentence imposed and no lesser sentence is warranted. 



Decision 

16Error by a sentencing judge in following the decision in Way before Muldrock will not necessarily lead to the intervention of this court: Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23. It is necessary to consider whether ""some other sentence...is warranted in law and should have been passed"": s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

17Both counsel referred in written submissions to a number of cases dealing with sentences imposed for offences contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act and submissions were made about matters of distinction. Whilst that material is useful, each case must be considered in light of its own facts. No two cases are the same and there is no single correct sentence: Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. 

18The applicant drew attention to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics which reveal that of the 76 offenders considered in the higher courts since the introduction of the standard non-parole period for offences contrary to s 35(2), only 15 per cent of offenders received a total term of more than 4 years. Only 50 per cent of all offenders (including those that pleaded not guilty) received a total term of more than 3 years. Furthermore, of the 66 offenders who received a non-consecutive non-parole period, only 3 offenders received a non-parole period in excess of 3 years. 73 per cent of offenders received a sentence of 2 years imprisonment or less. The applicant submitted that there was nothing about the present offence that would place it towards the top of the range established by the sentencing statistics.

19Although useful as a guide to establish sentencing practice, the limited use that might be made of Judicial Commission statistics is well recognised. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Lao [2003] NSWCCA 315 at [33]: 

""They reflect what was regarded as appropriate in the wide variety of circumstances in the cases reported in those statistics."" 

20The sentencing judge correctly acknowledged that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence under s 35(2) will significantly depend upon the harm suffered by the victim: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94; R v Thawer [2009] NSWCCA 158. Her Honour recognised that other factors such as the nature of the attack and the surrounding circumstances were also relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence: McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439. The nature of the injuries that Mr Wheatley, who was 54 years old, suffered was indeed serious. He was hospitalised for about a month and suffered the loss of his spleen, permanent operative scarring, continuing pain and psychological difficulties. The offence was not pre-meditated, but regrettably arose from a trivial argument. 

21The applicant accepts that the injuries were serious, but submits they were not so serious as to make the offence a middle of the range offence when the act causing the injury was a single one-handed blow to the torso. This submission appears to confuse the seriousness of the injury with the nature of the attack upon the victim. In any event, I do not think that the applicant is assisted by the manner in which he injured Mr Wheatley. When Mr Wheatley had turned around to walk to his house, the applicant picked up the piece of wood and struck Mr Wheatley with it on the left side of the back. The applicant continued the attack, striking Mr Wheatley once more with the piece of wood to the elbow and unsuccessfully attempted to strike him again. The piece of wood was about a metre long. 

22Nevertheless, I consider that the seriousness of the injuries and the manner in which they were inflicted do not justify a sentence of imprisonment with an undiscounted starting point of 5 years. The sentencing judge neither referred to the standard non-parole period as being simply a guideline or yardstick, nor that it did not directly apply as the applicant had pleaded guilty. In my respectful opinion, the sentencing judge placed too much significance on the standard non-parole period resulting in a sentence that is not warranted in law and some other sentence should have been passed. The sentence imposed should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. 

23No additional material relevant to sentencing has been filed on behalf of the applicant. He was allowed a discount of 10 per cent for his plea of guilty. It has not been submitted that that was an inappropriate discount. Furthermore, the applicant does not contend that the sentencing judge should have found special circumstances. 

24The maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 4 years. Bearing in mind these two guideposts, when the objective seriousness of the criminality involved and the subjective features of the applicant are considered and allowing a 10 per cent discount for the plea, the applicant should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years 8 months which consists of a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months and a balance of term of 11 months. I do not find special circumstances. 
















25Accordingly, the orders that I propose are:

1. Leave to appeal granted. 

2. Appeal upheld. 

3. The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. 

4. The applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a 
non-parole period of 2 years 9 months to commence on 26 September 2010 and to expire on 25 June 2013. The balance of term of 11 months is to commence on 26 June 2013 and to expire on 25 May 2014. 

26The earliest date that the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 25 June 2013. 

27BUTTON J: I agree with Price J.

2707975,R v DAJ [2012] NSWCCA 143,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hidden J.
2HIDDEN J:  This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed upon the respondent, DAJ, for a series of offences of sexual assault committed upon a child.  He was found guilty of these offences after a trial in the District Court by judge alone.  He was also sentenced for failing to appear, an offence under s 51(1) of the Bail Act 1978, but no appeal is brought against that sentence.  As to the sexual offences he was found guilty of four counts of aggravated indecent assault, an offence under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years, and two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, an offence under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
3The trial judge passed sentence for these offences in the escalating order of their gravity, as follows:
Failing to appear, a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months, dating from 15 October 2009;
Counts 1 and 2 (aggravated indecent assault): concurrent terms of imprisonment for 2 years, with a non-parole period of 18 months, dating from 14 April 2010;
Counts 5 and 6 (aggravated indecent assault): concurrent terms of imprisonment for 2 years, with a non-parole period of 18 months, dating from 14 July 2010;
Count 3 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent): imprisonment for 3 ½ years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, dating from 14 October 2010;
Count 4 (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent): imprisonment for 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, also dating from 14 October 2010.
4The aggregate sentence (including the fail to appear offence) was imprisonment for 4 ½ years, with an effective non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, dating from 15 October 2009.  It will be seen that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 were accumulated upon the sentence for failing to appear by 6 months, that the sentences for counts 5 and 6 were accumulated by a further 3 months, and the sentences on counts 3 and 4 by yet a further 3 months.  The aggregate sentence for the sexual offences was imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, dating from 14 April 2010.
5The victim of the offences was the daughter of a woman with whom the respondent was in a relationship.  They occurred over a period of years, beginning some time in 2003 or 2004 and concluding in the first half of 2007, the first when she was 9 or 10 years old and the last when she was 13.  The respondent was in his early 30s.  The offences charged were part of a wider pattern of abuse.  The trial judge announced his verdicts, after delivering lengthy reasons, on 16 January 2009.  There was considerable delay before the respondent was sentenced, partly due to fact that he failed to answer his bail on 20 February 2009, the day to which the matter was adjourned for sentence proceedings, and was not apprehended until October of that year.  It was this which gave rise to the charge of failing to appear.
Facts
6In the remarks on sentence his Honour set out his findings of fact, also at some length.  To understand the circumstances of the offences, and their gravity, it is appropriate to set out that part of the remarks:
""The background to these offences was that the prisoner met the complainant's mother SC, in late 1998. In March 1999, she and her four children moved to Sydney. In late 1999 [the] prisoner and she commenced to live together with the four children of the family. In October 2000 the prisoner, SC, and the children, moved from Sydney to a property at [property name suppressed - will refer to as Property W] on the central coast. It was at that location where the first two or three counts on the indictment were committed. 
The background was that the prisoner was routinely working long hours in Sydney and commuting. In early 2001 the prisoner's wife [SC] became pregnant with their first child, who was born in October 2001. In February 2003 a second child, a daughter, was born into that relationship. In March 2004 the prisoner commenced to work in [location suppressed - will refer to as Rural area A] for the National Australia Bank and in April 2004 the family moved to a property called [property name suppressed - will refer to as Property R] at [Rural area A]. It was at that location that the offence comprising the fourth count occurred. In July 2004 the family company, comprising the prisoner and his then wife, purchased a rural property near the township of [township suppressed - will refer to as Township B]. It was at that location that the last two offences on the indictment occurred. 
...
So far as count 1 [aggravated indecent assault] was concerned, the complainant said that she was in her own bed at [Property W] late at night. She said that the prisoner came in and started touching her stomach and upper thigh, and then touched her vagina. She thought that it was some months before the family left [Property W]. She woke up when she was touched. Thereafter she rolled over and tried to go back to sleep. She said that the accused touched her on the stomach gently, not doing her any harm, but that she was touched on the stomach and underneath her pyjamas. She was also touched on her vagina and stated in the interview that 'she had no clothes on underneath her pyjamas'. She described what occurred as the accused just rubbing over the top of her vagina. She said that she was scared. She did not know what to do because she understood that what happened was wrong. 
I should interpolate to say that at the time this offence occurred, the victim IC was between nine and ten years of age. It was her evidence that the incident went on for about half an hour or maybe fifteen minutes. She attempted to push his hand away and rolled over. She pushed him away and rolled over and said that the prisoner attempted to roll her back again and attempted to repeat his actions. However, no further activity took place at that stage. 
In relation to the second count [aggravated indecent assault] which occurred when the victim was ten years of age, she said this: That occurred at the premises at [Property W]. She said that at that stage she was sharing a bed with her younger sibling EC. The prisoner came into the room and she said just did the same thing, he felt all around her stomach and legs and then on her vagina again. She said that her younger sibling was then asleep. She said the offender came in and knelt beside the bed and just did the same thing, namely touched her stomach, legs and vagina, as well as her upper thigh. Again, she said she was touched underneath her clothing on her skin, and he, as he did previously, just attempted to rub it, referring to her vagina, with his hands and fingers. She said that she felt angry and was worried when this occurred. She tried to push him away and he just did it again. Once again, she considered that that incident took place in the space of fifteen or more minutes. 
The third count [aggravated sexual intercourse without consent] occurred at [Property W] at a time when the [victim] was a little over ten years of age. She said that on this occasion the incident occurred in a room downstairs. She said that the prisoner just came down and she stated that, 'He licked his finger and put it in my vagina'. She said initially that he did not touch or do anything else, but ultimately said that he also rubbed her near her vagina and around her stomach and legs. She said that the prisoner pushed on something and it hurt. The victim pushed his hand away and he was 'like a bit more gentle'. Apparently he stopped doing what he started and did not try and push further. She said that for a period of time he continued to have his finger inside her vagina and it appeared to her to be a lengthy period of time. For reasons which I will explain, I do not put much store on her estimate of time, given that she was then about ten years of age, and given that I consider that the trauma which would have attended this event would most likely have clouded any accurate assessment by her of the precise length of time over which these matters occurred. She confirmed that he did in fact push his finger 'like right inside' and when it really hurt she pushed him away. 
The fourth count, another count of aggravated sexual intercourse, occurred at [Rural area A]. The victim said that she was in a room with her sister EC and upstairs. She said that the prisoner came into the room and touched her on the same place, being a reference to her vagina, and said that she was touched around her legs and stomach. She stated that the prisoner touched her on both the inside and outside of her vagina, 'because I felt it'. She tried to push his hand away, she rolled over and went back to sleep. On this occasion she said she felt annoyed and she did not tell anybody what had happened. 
She gave evidence in cross-examination that such events occurred on a number of occasions, once at [Property W] and once at [Property R], which is the premises at [Rural area A]. She also said that on one of these occasions the prisoner told her that he loved her. It was her evidence that the events comprising count 4 took place in the space of fifteen or thirty minutes. She confirmed that he penetrated her on this occasion, although not to the extent which occurred in count 3. 
The fifth count [aggravated indecent assault] occurred at [Township B] between 2005 and 2007, and the victim said that she, by this stage, was boarding at a private school in [Rural area A], that she returned home on the weekends and on holidays, and on one such occasion she was watching television and/or videos when the offender came into the room. She described him as going a bit funny and attempting to kiss her. It was an open mouth kiss and the victim pulled away. She said that her mother had gone to bed and the prisoner attempted to touch her 'everywhere' on her upper body and on her 'boobs' as she described them, on her stomach and also attempted to touch her vagina. She said at this stage she would push him away. She stated that on most of the occasions that these things occurred he had been drinking and that he liked to drink 'like every night' she said. 
The final count [aggravated indecent assault] took place between March 2007 and May 2007. She said that she was home from boarding school on that occasion. She and the prisoner would stay up late. She said that he would say to her, 'You can come and sleep with us', referring to he and the victim's mother. She said that she would jump into bed next to her mother and he would come in and try and do it again. On a particular weekend, the subject of count 6, she stated that the prisoner 'just touched me on the vagina'. She said this was when she got in next to her mother, and once again she stated that the touching was underneath her clothes on her bare skin. 
She gave further evidence, which I permitted as context evidence, that on a number of occasions over the years between when these offences occurred he would often grab her hand and try and put it on his erect penis. I should say, as I did when handing down my reasons in January 2009, the context evidence does not make the objective seriousness of the six counts any more serious. It is impermissible to use that material as reflecting on the objective gravity of the six counts. What it does is put into context the fact that the events comprising the six counts did not happen in isolation but were part of a course of conduct. They reflect, therefore, on the objective seriousness of those individual matters as simply putting them into a context of not an isolated aberration, but something a little more than that. 
I noted in the judgment of January 2009 that these acts, if they occurred and I found that they did, clearly involved a betrayal of trust, but were not accompanied by any force or violence. The victim said she was scared of the accused. I accept that statement of what her feelings were at the time.""
7In summary, then, the first two counts (aggravated indecent assault) involved touching the complainant's vagina and the area around it, the third and fourth counts (aggravated sexual intercourse without consent) involved digital penetration, the fifth count (aggravated indecent assault) involved kissing and attempting to touch the complainant's breasts and vagina, and the sixth count (aggravated indecent assault) involved touching her vagina.  In each count the circumstance of aggravation was her age.  There were other incidents of a similar kind, and on occasions he tried to put her hand on his erect penis.
Subjective case
8The respondent is now 39 years old.  Apart from a traffic matter of no present significance, he had no previous convictions.  However, in 2007, after the sexual offences had come to an end, he was convicted in the Local Court of a number of charges of obtaining money by deception and received a 12 month suspended sentence.  
9There was extensive evidence on sentence, to which it is not necessary to refer in any detail.  The respondent is well educated, had been in consistent and responsible employment, and had enjoyed a good reputation in the community.  His relationship with SC broke down in 2007, at a time of financial stress because the [Township B] property had been affected by drought.  He attempted suicide after the separation, a fact which he attributed to the breakdown of the relationship and financial difficulties but which his Honour saw as also caused by his sexual offences coming to light.  In August 2008, he met his current partner.  He continued that relationship after he absconded on bail, and they have a young child.  At the time of sentence she was standing by him, a fact which his Honour respected.  
10Before his Honour were a number of psychological reports and a report of Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist.  Some of the reports were prepared for the proceedings relating to the charges of obtaining money by deception, concluding that the respondent had been through a major depressive episode at that time brought on by financial difficulties and the relationship breakdown.  Dr Nielssen, who prepared a report for the present sentence proceedings, diagnosed him as suffering from major depression, noting that he was in protective custody and experiencing a high level of stress and depression.  He had been assaulted while in custody, although it appears that this was unrelated to these offences.  
11His Honour found that the respondent's period in custody had ""affected him greatly"", and judged him to be ""a person who has probably felt the sting of prison much more severely than many others.""  His Honour approached the question of rehabilitation with some caution but, given his experience of prison and his prior good standing in the community, was ""inclined to accept"" that he was unlikely to re-offend provided he undertook sex offender courses which should be available to him.  
The appeal
12The Crown prosecutor argued five grounds of appeal, challenging aspects of the sentencing judge's reasons but also asserting that, in any event, the sentences were manifestly inadequate.  As I have decided that the ground of inadequacy is made out, it is unnecessary to decide the other more specific grounds.  However, it is appropriate to consider them briefly because they raise matters relevant to re-sentence.  
13The first two grounds can be considered together.  They are that his Honour erred in taking into account circumstances of hardship in respect of the respondent's custody in the absence of evidence supporting that finding, and by taking into account the prison assault as extra-curial punishment for his offences.  
14As to the first matter, his Honour noted the respondent's evidence that he was in protection, ""being locked up for some eighteen hours a day.""  He later said, ""... he is on protection and will by reason of that suffer harsher than usual conditions and I have taken that matter into account.""  The Crown prosecutor pointed to evidence that during the six hours that the respondent was allowed outside of his cell he had been able to undertake courses in anger and stress management and was on the waiting list for another course.  She submitted that there was no evidence of what the usual custodial conditions were, and nothing to suggest that his conditions would deteriorate after sentence.  She referred to authority that an offender must lead evidence to show that his or her conditions of imprisonment would be more onerous than normal: see, for example, Clinton v R [2009] NSWCCA 276 at [14] - [28].
15The Crown prosecutor also argued that his Honour appeared to take into account the prison assault as a form of extra-curial punishment, even though there was no nexus between that assault and the respondent's offences.  She referred to Silvano v R [2008] NSWCCA 118, 184 A Crim R 593, at [24] - [36].  However, there is force in the argument of counsel for the respondent, Mr Newton, that it is far from clear from his Honour's remarks that he was treating the evidence of the assault in that way.  His Honour was dealing with a submission by counsel then appearing for the respondent that a number of matters amounted to extra-curial punishment, a submission which he appears to have approached with some reservation.  It was immediately after that that he referred to the assault, but a fair reading of the remarks could convey that he was treating that as a discrete matter.  
16There appears to be more merit in the first ground.  Mr Newton did not address directly the question of the respondent's protected status, but relied upon his Honour's general observation about the effect of prison upon him and the finding that he probably felt the sting of prison more than many others.  In my view, that was an assessment open to his Honour and one to which the prison assault was relevant.  That is how I would approach the evidence for the purpose of re-sentence.  It is not necessary to express any concluded view about these two grounds.
17Grounds 3 and 4 assert that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences and that, in doing so, he was ""inappropriately guided"" by a Public Defenders' schedule of cases which had been supplied to him.  His Honour said in his remarks that he had ""carefully examined"" that schedule of cases.  The Crown prosecutor argued that the schedule was not a fair representation of the current pattern of sentence for the present offences.  Here again, as Mr Newton submitted, what his Honour said about that schedule has to be read in context.  His reference to it immediately preceded his assessment of the objective gravity of the respondent's offences, but it is by no means clear that he used it for that specific purpose.
18However that may be, there is more substance in the Crown prosecutor's challenge to what his Honour had to say about objective gravity.  He referred to a number of matters relevant to that assessment, including the age of the complainant at the time, the breach of trust by the respondent, whom she saw as her father, the period over which the offences were committed, the fact that they were not isolated incidents, and that they would ""no doubt have a significant impact upon the victim in the future.""  That said, his Honour expressed no finding about the objective gravity of the aggravated indecent assaults (counts 1, 2, 5 and 6).  As to the counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, counts 3 and 4, he found count 3 more serious than count 4 because it was a relatively lengthy episode, causing the victim pain.  Nevertheless, he concluded that count 3 was well below the mid-range of objective seriousness, in fact, at the lower end of the range.
19I appreciate that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent embraces a wide variety of behaviour, and that this court recognises that the characterisation of the objective seriousness of any offence is a matter of judgment ""classically within the role of the sentencing judge"": Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, per Spigelman CJ at [37].  Nevertheless, his Honour's conclusion seems difficult to support, particularly given that the victim was only 9 or 10 years old at the time of counts 3 and 4, that the respondent stood in loco parentis to her, and that these were not isolated incidents.  His Honour found that the offences were not accompanied by force, coercion or threats but, of course, the vulnerability of such a young victim is such that that is commonly the case.  
20No doubt, his Honour expressed an assessment of the objective gravity  of those offences in the way he did because they attract a standard non-parole period.  The respondent was sentenced before the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, 244 CLR 120.  In the light of that decision, an assessment of that kind was unnecessary.  Nevertheless, his Honour made it and it conveys to me that he underestimated the gravity of those two offences.  There is force in the Crown prosecutor's submission, also expressed in ground 4, that an erroneous assessment of the gravity of all the offences has led to an overall sentence which is manifestly inadequate.  
21Ground 5 is that his Honour erred in failing adequately to accumulate the sentences, providing another reason for the inadequacy of the overall sentence.  Certainly, the accumulation of the sentences for the sexual assaults was minimal, but again there is no need to decide this ground or to examine the now familiar authorities on accumulation of sentence to which the Crown prosecutor referred us.  As I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed and the respondent re-sentenced, it would be for this court to exercise its own discretion in determining the measure of accumulation.
Re-sentence
22I have referred to his Honour's guarded but basically favourable assessment of the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation.  The genesis of the offences, his Honour found, was in the long hours the respondent was working, the considerable distance he had to travel to and from work, and his likely use of alcohol to excess.  He described the offences as ""opportunistic"", and concluded that they were the product of stress and alcohol reducing his inhibitions.  This does provide some explanation for the respondent's behaviour but, of course, it is no excuse for it.
23On the question of re-sentence, a number of affidavits were read in this court.  They establish the stress and anxiety which imprisonment continues to engender in the respondent.  In February of this year, a close friend of his, to whom he had been a mentor, committed suicide in his cell.  He is on a course of medication for his depressive illness.  He has been undergoing a program directed to understanding sexual offending, and is willing to undertake any further program which becomes available to him.
24His partner remains supportive of him, as do his parents and his sister.  Regular contact with his partner and their child, who is now 2 years old, has been difficult because they reside in Brisbane.  When he is released, he plans to join them in Brisbane and obtain employment there.
25While taking those matters into account, the fact remains that justice demands a significant increase of the respondent's overall sentence.  The orders I propose would increase the aggregate sentence for the sexual offences to imprisonment for 6 ½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months.  I would confirm the sentences on the aggravated indecent assault counts, but direct that the sentences on counts 5 and 6 commence 6 months after those on counts 1 and 2.  I would increase the sentences on each of the counts of sexual intercourse without consent, counts 3 and 4.  I would accumulate the sentence on count 4 by a further 6 months, and the sentence on count 3 (which I accept to be somewhat more serious) by yet a further 6 months.  In setting the non-parole periods for counts 3 and 4, I would find special circumstances because of the accumulation of sentences.  
26Factoring in the 6 month sentence for failing to appear, the total sentence would be imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months.  This would give the respondent the benefit of eligibility for a significant period of supervised liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole.
27On counts 1 and 2, I would confirm the sentences of imprisonment for 2 years, comprising a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 6 months, dating from 14 April 2010.  On counts 5 and 6, I would also confirm the sentences of imprisonment for 2 years, comprising a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 6 months, but would direct those sentences to commence on 14 October 2010.  
28On count 4, I would quash the sentence passed in the District Court and re-sentence the respondent to imprisonment for 4 ½ years, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 14 April 2011 and expiring on 13 April 2014, and a balance of term of 18 months, commencing on 14 April 2014 and expiring on 13 October 2015.  On count 3, I would sentence the respondent to imprisonment for 5 years, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 14 October 2011 and expiring on 13 July 2014, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 14 July 2014 and expiring on 13 October 2016.
29The respondent would be eligible for release on parole on 13 July 2014.  
30HISLOP J:  I agree with Hidden J.

2707976,Spark v R [2012] NSWCCA 140,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court in May 2010 after pleading guilty to two counts of manslaughter in the Local Court in October 2009.  These offences were committed on 6 September 2008 when the applicant drove a stolen vehicle on the incorrect side of the road and collided head on with another vehicle killing the driver and the passenger. 
3Section 18(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 provides for a maximum of 25 years imprisonment on each count.  
4A non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months with an additional term of 3 years and 9 months was imposed on the second count.  This was partially accumulated on the first count where a non-parole period of 9 years and 9 months with an additional term of 3 years and 9 months was imposed after two offences on the Form 1 were taken into account in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The offences on the Form 1 consisted of an aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act and an offence of take and drive conveyance contrary to s 154A(1) of the Crimes Act.  In the result, an effective term of imprisonment of 15 years was imposed comprised of a non-parole period of 11 years and 3 months with a parole period of 3 years and 9 months.
The facts for sentencing purposes
5A statement of agreed facts was tendered on sentence.  An expert pharmacologist and a consultant physician in sleep and respiratory medicine gave evidence for the Crown.  What follows is a summary of the agreed facts and the evidence of the experts from which the sentencing judge made relevant factual findings.  
6At about 10.50pm on 5 September 2008, a residence at Glenmore Park was broken into in the course of which the car keys to a Mazda RX8, which was parked in the driveway, were stolen.  The owner saw the car being reversed down the driveway and driven away.  This conduct gave rise to the offences on the Form 1.  The applicant was under the combined influence of the drugs methylamphetamine and amphetamines at this time.  He has never held a drivers licence.  He informed police that over the preceding month he had used 3.5 grams of amphetamine daily.  
7He did not sleep that night by reason of the effects of the illicit drugs.  He also consumed alcohol.  
8The following morning, 6 September 2008, he drove the stolen Mazda around the Riverstone/Windsor area.  At about 8.05am police received notification of a failure to pay at a service station on Windsor Road involving a stolen Mazda RX8.  About 30 minutes later, highway patrol police observed the Mazda turning left onto Windsor Road from Bandon Road heading north.  At that point Windsor Road is a two lane roadway with a designated speed of 80 kilometres per hour.  Police activated the lights, sirens and in-car video and accelerated up behind the Mazda.  The applicant accelerated away from the highway patrol vehicle.  He crossed lanes without indicating, overtook a vehicle and accelerated away under increasing speed.  The police called a pursuit over the radio.
9The Court was given access to an aerial map tendered on sentence which was cross-referenced to various witness statements which tracked the police pursuit over 2.2 kilometres.  The applicant's path of travel was then tracked for a further 3.2 kilometres to the point of impact with the car in which the deceased were travelling.  We also viewed the in-car video of the police pursuit which showed, in graphic terms, the applicant's manner of driving under speed in the hazardous wet conditions as he changed lanes without indicating, on two occasions overtaking vehicles after moving onto the left hand shoulder area of the roadway and on one occasion on approach to the intersection with Blackwood Road.  Although the Blackwood Road intersection is not controlled by traffic lights, the applicant passed through three intersections before the collision which were controlled by traffic lights.   It was simply fortuitous that the applicant had the green lights in his favour as he proceeded through those three intersections as the speed at which he was travelling would not have enabled him to stop were they to have changed from amber to red. 
10On approaching a left hand bend in Windsor Road, the applicant cut across the centre marking before overtaking two vehicles.  At this time, the Highway Patrol vehicle was registering a speed of 186 kilometres per hour against the applicable speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour.
11At the intersection with Brennan's Dam Road a vehicle pulled out onto Windsor Road and stopped at the centre concrete divider.  The applicant continued to accelerate past that vehicle before driving in the centre of double lanes, straddling the centre dividing line before proceeding through the intersection of Windsor Road and Park Road. 
12Police terminated the pursuit at 8.33am, 54 seconds and 2.2 kilometres after activating the sirens.  The applicant was last seen by police travelling north along Windsor Road towards Windsor at an excessive speed.
13A driver preparing to turn from Windsor Road into the Mobil service station near the intersection of Pitt Town Road described the applicant as ""flashing"" past with water spraying everywhere ""like rooster tails from a speed boat"".  Another driver travelling south on Windsor Road and preparing to make a right turn into the Mobil service station became aware of the applicant coming towards him at speed.  He quickly changed lanes narrowly avoiding a collision.  The applicant sped past that vehicle on the incorrect side of the road overtaking two vehicles at the Pitt Town Road intersection on the incorrect side of the road.  
14At this point Windsor Road narrows to one northbound and one southbound lane.  The applicant moved back onto the correct side without indicating, travelling at a speed which was described by a witness as ""flat out"".  He then came up behind another vehicle and tailgated that vehicle causing the driver to fear imminent collision.  The applicant then edged his vehicle towards the centre of the road before crossing to the incorrect side of the road under speed. 
15Mrs Christine Paterson was driving south along Windsor Road at Windsor.  Her 18-year-old daughter, Christine Paterson, was seated in the front passenger seat.  Mrs Paterson was driving her daughter to work.  As Mrs Paterson's vehicle neared the crest of the Fitzroy Bridge, she was confronted with the applicant's vehicle on the incorrect side of the road occupying the southbound lane.  She attempted to take evasive action but the vehicles collided head on.
16Both vehicles left the road surface under the force of the collision.  Mrs Paterson's vehicle hit the protective railing rotating 180 degrees before it came to rest.  It sustained very heavy front-end damage.  The bonnet had been pushed inwards towards the dashboard.  Although both airbags were deployed Mrs Paterson and her daughter died instantly.
17The minimum average speed of the applicant's vehicle during the police pursuit was 146 kilometres per hour, with speeds up to 185 kilometres per hour being registered.  The distance from the commencement of the pursuit to the collision was 5.4 kilometres.  The total distance from the termination of the pursuit to the collision was 3.2 kilometres.  From the termination of the pursuit until the collision the applicant drove at an average speed of between 122.4 and 130.8 kilometres per hour.  The applicable speed limit at the site of the collision was 60 kilometres per hour.
18The damage to the front end of the Mazda was also extensive.  The applicant suffered injuries to his back and neck and internal abdominal injuries.  He was transported to Nepean Hospital where he remained for twelve days under police guard.  An order revoking his parole was served whilst he was in hospital.  Upon discharge he was taken into custody where he remained until sentence.  
19The applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview with police on 30 October 2008.  He told police: (a) The Thursday prior to the collision he had a couple of drinks and smoked approximately half a gram of ice (methylamphetamine).
(b) He did not sleep Thursday (4 September) or Friday (5 September) and was heading back to where he was staying on the Saturday morning (6 September) for a shower and some sleep.
(c) He had used ""speed"" every day from August until the day of the collision.  He was using about 3.5 grams per day.
(d) Due to his level of drug use the applicant told police that he was confused to the point where he did not know what day of the week it was.
(e) He admitted to driving the Mazda knowing it was stolen.
(f) He recalled driving the Mazda on a number of occasions leading up to the collision including along the M4 and, on the morning of the collision, along Windsor Road.  He said that he did not have any recollection of the police pursuit or the collision.
20Dr Judith Perl, pharmacologist, provided a report concerning the effect of the applicant's drug use on his driving ability, based on the history he provided to police.  Her opinion was that symptoms described by the applicant of being ""dead tired"" on the morning of the collision were consistent with the intense fatigue which is customarily experienced following heavy use of methylamphetamine.  She also gave evidence that, accepting that the applicant was in the drug withdrawal stage on the morning of the collision after heavy methylamphetamine use, his perception and judgment would have been impaired, as would his reaction skills.  This is in contrast with an increase in aggressive or risk taking behaviour whilst subject to the effect of the drug.  She also reported that in the withdrawal phase the applicant would have had an impaired ability to concentrate with decreased vigilance and alertness.  Dr Perl stated that these symptoms commonly manifest themselves in erratic driving or weaving, an inability to maintain lane position and an inability to maintain a vehicle at a consistent speed.  She did not consider that the applicant's alcohol intake leading up to the collision was a factor in the collision.
21Dr Peter Buchanan, a consultant physician in sleep and respiratory medicine, provided a report in relation to the level of alertness of the applicant at the time of the collision.  Again, based on the applicant's account to police, Dr Buchanan concluded that the applicant was driving with a total sleep deprivation of over 40 hours which likely led to his having marked sleepiness and severely impaired psychomotor performance.  Dr Buchanan agreed that the withdrawal state from major methylamphetamine abuse would also have contributed to the applicant's sleepiness and impaired driving ability.
22Police examined the Mazda.  No mechanical fault was detected.  On the day of the collision the weather was wet and overcast.  It was raining steadily throughout the police pursuit and at the time of the collision.
The applicant's case on sentence
23The applicant relied upon a psychological report from Dr Emma Collins dated 16 December 2009 and evidence from his stepfather, a letter from his mother and a letter the applicant forwarded to the husband and father of the deceased.  
Plea of guilty and remorse
24The sentencing judge accepted that his letter reflected genuine remorse and that his record of interview was also reflective of his having accepted responsibility for his conduct.  Together with his plea of guilty in the Local Court from which he was committed to the District Court for sentence she allowed a discount of 25 per cent on each count.  (This is the subject of the fourth ground of appeal.)
The applicant's subjective circumstances 
25At the time of the offence the applicant was aged 23 and 25 at the time of sentence.  The sentencing judge noted that he had a significant criminal record, commencing in the Children's Court, which not only included repeated offences involving the taking and driving of motor vehicles whilst unlicensed but also offences of violence including robbery in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and various offences of dishonesty.  Her Honour also noted that the applicant had been the recipient of almost every form of custodial and non-custodial supervision since 2000 including, most recently, a period of full-time imprisonment for a take and drive offence and that he was subject to parole for this offence at the time of committing the subject offences.
26On 27 May 2008 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months (back dated to January 2008) for breach of a s 12 bond imposed for a take and drive vehicle offence in July 2007 and using a stolen vehicle in May 2008.  His criminal antecedents, which are otherwise extensive, record four take and drive offences between 2000 and 2008.  He was released on parole on 11 July 2008 - just short of two months prior to the offending the subject of this appeal.  
27His criminal offending as a juvenile was coincident with and consequent upon the Department of Community Services assuming responsibility for his welfare at age 13 after his persistent refusal to accept supervision in the family home.  He lived in various forms of hostel care with little supervision from that time where he continued to commit offences.  At the time of sentence he had a long-term girlfriend and a young child and enjoyed ongoing support from his mother, stepfather and sisters. 
28His primary school education was interrupted by changes in schools.  The greater part of his secondary school education was provided in custodial settings.  He had a limited employment history having admitted to Dr Collins that he financed his lifestyle by committing criminal offences.
29His medical and psychological history included a diagnosis for ADHD in his early teenage years for which he was medicated.  This regime was complicated by drug abuse with various failed attempts by community-based services to assist him to address his substance abuse issues.  In her remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge noted that his attempts to cease drug use in the past had invariably failed upon his release from custody despite access to a custody-based methadone program.  She also noted that evidence was tendered in respect of the injuries he sustained in the collision and his ongoing medical difficulties. 
Special circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation
30The sentencing judge quoted at some length from Dr Collins' report when considering the question of rehabilitation.  Although she was urged to make a finding that that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were good and that his risk of reoffending was low, she was unable to reach that concluded view.  She noted that while the applicant is in a custodial setting and not using drugs he was able to develop some degree of empathy and insight into his offending behaviour, and that although his claim of wanting to make some positive changes to his life could be genuine it remained untested.  That said, she also found that he may have reached a stage where offending is a less attractive proposition than it has been in the past.  The sentencing judge also observed that the applicant appeared to already be institutionalised to some extent in that he appeared to cope better inside the prison environment than in the community.  She concluded that the seriousness of the offending and the need for a significant custodial sentence outweighed the need for rehabilitative treatment in the short term.
31The sentencing judge was however satisfied that the various matters mentioned in Dr Collins' report, including the applicant's age, health and his personal circumstances, supported what she described as a ""limited"" finding of special circumstances.  In this context she again made reference to the applicant's failed attempts at rehabilitation in the past and his chronic drug addiction.  Neither the fact that she was satisfied that the applicant was already to an extent institutionalised nor the need for partial accumulation of the individual sentences were identified by her Honour as material to her finding of special circumstances. 
The grounds of appeal
32The applicant relies on five grounds of appeal. 
The first ground of appeal 
33There was no challenge to the accumulation of 18 months between the first and second counts, or to the statutory ratio on the first count being moderated to 70 per cent and on the second count to 72 per cent by reason of her Honour's finding that special circumstances justified disturbing the statutory ratio of 75 per cent fixed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The applicant contended that the sentencing judge was in error in failing to give effect to that finding after the order for partial accumulation.  The statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total term was preserved in the aggregated sentence. 
34The degree of variation to the ratio between non-parole period and total term following a finding of special circumstances is discretionary.  As Allsop P observed in Kalache v R [2011] NSWCCA 210 at [2], the concept of special circumstances in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is a reflection of the rehabilitative purposes of sentence and for that reason affects the justice and appropriateness of the overall sentence.  
35While the factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion obviously differ from case to case, in a given case the same factors are frequently relied upon both to attract a finding of special circumstances and the degree to which the statutory ratio should be varied so as to provide for extended supervision on parole.  When sentences for multiple counts are imposed, and when it is clear that some accumulation is necessary between individual counts, the relative weight to be afforded these discretionary considerations will be important.  The exercise of the discretion may however be productive of different results at different phases of the sentencing process as occurred in this case.  To the extent that the applicant contends that because of the finding of special circumstances he was entitled to the same or a similar degree of variation in the statutory ratio after partial accumulation as that provided for in the calculation of the individual sentences, that submission must be rejected (R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252).  The sentencing judge retains a wide discretion as to whether the accumulation of sentences itself qualifies as a special circumstance.  In this case the sentencing judge made no such finding.  On the appeal this was not said to constitute error.  In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [36] Spigelman CJ said subject to the non-parole period being either manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive, this Court should be very slow to intervene to alter the ratio ultimately determined by the sentencing judge as an appropriate reflection of the minimum period which should be served in custody and what is required by way of extended supervision, even after a finding of special circumstances.
36In Kalache at [37] Buddin J cited a large number of cases where applications for leave to appeal against sentence have been mounted on the basis that the sentencing judge had failed to give effect to a finding of special circumstances when structuring the overall sentencing outcome, and where this Court has intervened as a result.  As Howie J observed in Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 (noted with approval by Allsop P in Kalache), where a finding of special circumstances is made it is crucial that the intention of the sentencing judge in producing the sentencing outcome is discernible lest there be a suggestion that the structure of a particular sentence or sentences is the result of inadvertence in the failure to give effect to a finding of special circumstances.  In Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 RA Hulme J observed at [36] that:There was no inadvertence or miscalculation in the present case. The sentence judge explicitly stated that she was satisfied that there should be some increase in the parole period on the sentence for the ecstasy offence because a longer period of supervision following release from custody was required. However, she also specifically stated that the increase she proposed would not be ""much"".
37When dealing with the issue of special circumstances the sentencing judge said: ...The statutory ratio does provide significant supervision time when a lengthy sentence is proposed.  It will be appropriate to adjust it slightly, but as accumulation is anticipated, the major adjustment will be made on the second sentence imposed, to reflect a proper ratio on the accumulated sentences. 
Later in her sentencing remarks her Honour described the finding of special circumstances as ""limited"".
38The Crown submitted her Honour made an express finding that the impact of special circumstances would be limited to an alteration in the statutory ratio of the individual sentences, and that the length of the aggregate non-parole period, fixed in accordance with the statutory ratio, reflected her intention.  The Crown also submitted that her Honour was clearly mindful of the principle that the non-parole period should reflect the criminality involved in an offence, including the need for general deterrence, and that in this case those considerations weighed heavily in the fixing of the aggregate non-parole period of 11 years and 3 months, particularly where she had made only guarded findings on the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.
39The applicant relied upon the same extract in support of the submission that her Honour intended some minor adjustment to the statutory ratio after accumulation, and that the reference to the ""proper ratio on the accumulated sentence"" was not the statutory ratio but of a variation of the ratio to the same degree as that which was applied to the individual sentences but that in the result she failed to carry that intention into effect.    
40While both constructions may be arguably open, when her Honour imposed the aggregate sentence it is difficult to conclude otherwise than that she intended to provide for a period of supervision on parole in the order of 3 years and 9 months and to provide for further rehabilitative support in that period.  While it would have been open to her Honour to have varied the ratio to provide for a slightly longer non-parole period, either because she had made a finding that the applicant was at the time of sentence to some extent institutionalised (Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162) or because of the fact that the sentences were to be partially accumulated, it was not submitted on the appeal that her Honour's discretion miscarried for that reason.  It is not for this Court to substitute its own view.
41In Kalache Buddin J observed that in Caristo, RA Hulme J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) reviewed the principles that underpin the discretionary finding of special circumstances at [41]:... the focus should not be solely upon the percentage proportions that the non-parole and parole periods bear to the total term. The actual periods involved are equally, and probably more, important. In the present case the judge's sentencing order allows for a potential period on parole of 2 years 6 months. There was no evidence before the judge that required a conclusion that this was insufficient to meet the purposes for which the judge found special circumstances. 
42I would dismiss the first ground of appeal.
The second and fifth grounds of appeal
43Grounds 2 and 5 are related.  Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge was in error in finding that the offending conduct reflected ""a higher and more serious criminality"" than other cases of motor vehicle manslaughter to which she was referred by counsel.  Ground 5 contends that the sentences imposed on both counts were otherwise manifestly excessive.  
44In assessing the level of objective seriousness as towards what the sentencing judge described as ""the higher end"" (of seriousness) falling short of the worst category of case comprehended by s 18(1) of the Crimes Act, her Honour took into account a number of features of aggravation about which there is no complaint.  In her sentencing remarks she said:[47]  When considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the court considers the following features as aggravating for matters of this type:(i)Driving a stolen car in the circumstances to which I have already referred.  There is some evidence of premeditation in the taking for driving and in the type of car taken.
(ii)Not stopping when called upon by police to do so.  In fact the offender took evasive action to stop police pursuing him, by increasing his speed, thus forcing in effect the police to abandon any hope of stopping him.
(iii)A continuation of excessive speed, even after the police stopped the pursuit, reinforces the finding that the manner of driving and total criminality had little to do with the pursuit by a police vehicle.
(iv)The manner of driving in wet road conditions.
(v)The fact that the offender had never been judged as competent to hold a driver's licence and drove nonetheless.
(vi)The number of road users in the vicinity of the immediate collision.  All of these road users were in potential danger and at least one was successful in taking evasive action.  However, in addition were the presumably many more road users, whom we do not see in the video and road users before the police actually saw the offender driving.  This and previous considerations are further evidence of the offender's lack of regard for rules and societal norms that relate to public safety.  The degree of criminality and potential danger to the public is compounded by the length of use of this vehicle by the offender, remembering at all times he was unlicensed and under the influence to some extent of illicit drugs.
(vii)The manner of driving for the short snapshot of time the police have evidence of is extraordinarily dangerous.  The offender drove at speed more than double the speed limit, 146 to 186 in an 80 kph zone and 120 to 130 in a 60 zone.  He drove on the wrong side of the road, not just at the time of the collision, but also at other times, when passing other cars at speed.  In general there was a flagrant breach of many road rules and a total and criminal disregard for public safety.
[48]  The level of recklessness is extreme.  The criminality of the offending behaviour as a whole is high.
45Her Honour also took into account as an aggravating feature the fact that the offences were committed while the applicant was on conditional release for similar offending as reflected in the offence on the Form 1. 
46In another part of her Honour's sentencing reasons, again not the subject of challenge, her Honour referred to the fact that the applicant's actions from the time of stealing the car until the collision (including 40 hours when he was deprived of sleep through his ingestion of illicit drugs and his determination to continue driving notwithstanding) were relevant to sentence as constituting a course of conduct which culminated in the offences for which he was to be sentenced.  She went on to say:...the course of criminality is not just the 5.4 km travelled from when he was first seen by police but from the time he first drove the car, and the focus of the criminal recklessness for this offence concentrated at least from the time he left Riverstone, some time before 7.55am [on the morning of the offences].  The collision was an almost inevitable result of the applicant's series of criminal decisions, commencing with taking and driving the motor vehicle.
47Her Honour was well aware of the range of sentences imposed in a number of motor vehicle manslaughter cases.  In her sentencing remarks she accurately and succinctly summarised the same body of case law to which the applicant referred on the appeal (R v Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324; 110 A Crim R 198; R v Falzon [2000] NSWCCA 530; R v Cameron [2005] NSWCCA 359; 157 A Crim R 70; Lawler v R [2007] NSWCCA 85; 169 A Crim R 415; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1; R v Young [2009] NSWCCA 298).  It is unnecessary to repeat that summary or undertake a summary of my own.  Unsurprisingly, there are both similarities and differences in the objective features of the offending in each case, and differences in the range and type of both aggravating factors and mitigating factors influencing the ultimate imposition of sentence.  It is also significant that some of the cases in this Court which attracted re-sentence involved considerations of double jeopardy (Cameron) and parity (Borkowski), and one where a different maximum penalty was involved (Cramp).
48The sentencing judge's finding that the level of objective criminality was worse or more serious (words she used interchangeably) than any of the cases to which she was referred was in part in response to the Crown's submission that this was a case in the worst category of manslaughter cases.  Although she did not ultimately find that the offending was in the worst category (determining instead to locate the offences towards the higher end of seriousness), given the range and extent of aggravating features identified by her Honour and the weight she was entitled to afford them, it was open to her to make the comparative assessment that the offending overall displayed a higher, or more serious criminality than any of the cases to which she had been referred.  The fact that some of the objective features of this applicant's offending appear in some of the cases, in particular drug use, speed, a police pursuit and reckless driving, did not oblige her Honour to assess the relative weight of the same features in the same way that other judges in other cases have assessed (or might have assessed) those features.  Neither am I of the view that her finding of a comparative high level of seriousness operated to impermissibly inflate the sentences that were ultimately imposed given the necessity for the sentence to reflect the need for general deterrence, and in this case to provide for personal deterrence given the applicant's criminal record, and the need for the sentence on the second count to reflect the separate and serious offences on the Form 1.
49Moreover, there are well recognised limitations on the utility of referring to sentences imposed in other cases to support an argument that a particular sentence is manifestly excessive.  In Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [48] the High Court had occasion to emphasise again that consistency in sentencing is not demonstrated by numerical equivalence and does not require it in order for the objective of reasonable consistency in sentencing to be achieved.  In Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1; 205 A Crim R 1 at [303]-[305], Simpson J identified the use to which information about other cases might legitimately be put.  In Hili the High Court regarded her Honour's remarks as accurate.  They said at [54]:...As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed.  That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits.  As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.""  But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"".  Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past.  They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added).  When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".
50In order to make good the submission that the individual sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, it is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate that the sentences were unreasonable or plainly unjust, and in that sense are outside the range of sentences open to be imposed in the exercise of a sentencing discretion, such as to demonstrate error (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).  In Windle v R [2011] NSWCCA 277 at [55], Hoeben JA endorsed that as the principled test to be applied where a sentence is said to be manifestly excessive.  It is not enough simply to show that the sentencing judge could have imposed a lesser sentence or that this Court might have done so (see House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505).
51The cases to which the sentencing judge was referred, and to which we were referred on the appeal, doubtless provided her Honour with some guidance as to the features of the offending which might impact upon the ultimate imposition of sentence, in particular the use of a high-performance stolen vehicle and driving under the influence of drugs and at high speed in heavily trafficked areas in hazardous conditions after refusing to respond to police direction to stop.  They did not however fix any upper limit of sentence inhibiting the exercise of her sentencing discretion.
52Although the individual sentences of respectively 12 years and 6 months on the second count and 13 years and 6 months on the first count (after taking into account the matters on the Form 1) are higher than any sentence imposed either in this Court or at first instance in a case of motor vehicle manslaughter, I am not persuaded, by that fact alone, that the sentences were beyond her Honour's legitimate sentencing discretion such as to constitute error.    
53Accordingly, I am not persuaded that either Ground 2 or Ground 5 of the appeal are made out.
The third ground of appeal
54The third ground of appeal concerned what is said to be error in the failure of the sentencing judge to take into account as a mitigating factor that the applicant sustained injuries in the collision.  The applicant's legal representative on sentence disclaimed any reliance on his injuries operating in mitigation of sentence independently of them forming part of the applicant's overall subjective circumstances and attracting such weight in the calculation of sentence as was appropriate having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending.  In my view that concession was properly made.  
55In R v Daetz; R v Wilson [2003] NSWCCA 216; 139 A Crim R 398 this Court held at [62]:... while it is the function of the courts to punish persons who have committed crimes, a sentencing court, in determining what sentence it should impose on an offender, can properly take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence. This is so, even where the detriment the offender has suffered has taken the form of extra-curial punishment by private persons exacting retribution or revenge for the commission of the offence. In sentencing the offender the court takes into account what extra-curial punishment the offender has suffered, because the court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure that the punishment the offender receives is what in all the circumstances is an appropriate punishment and not an excessive punishment. How much weight a sentencing judge should give any extra-curial punishment will, of course, depend on all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, there may well be many cases where extra-judicial punishment attracts little or no significant weight.
56From the materials tendered on sentence, including the discharge summary from the Nepean Hospital and some accompanying medical records, it must be assumed that her Honour was aware that the applicant's physical injuries included minimally displaced fractures in the vertebrae of his neck, a moderately comminuted fracture in the mid spine which required a laminectomy, and a bowel resection which was also surgically treated over the course of twelve days hospitalisation immediately following the collision.  Although she accepted that the applicant experienced physical pain during the course of his hospitalisation, she was not satisfied that this amounted to extra-curial punishment there being no evidence that the applicant suffered any ongoing disability as a result of the injuries aside from some discomfort which was treated with physiotherapy and pain relief as reflected in the Justice Health Progress Notes and as reported upon by Dr Collins.
57Although her Honour did not refer to the authorities which have recently considered the basis upon which injuries sustained in the commission of an offence may amount to extra-curial punishment (including in particular Whybrow v R [2008] NSWCCA 270 where the authorities including Daetz were considered), it is clear that she approached the question in a principled way.  While it is true that when considering the question of special circumstances her Honour noted that the applicant had enjoyed good health until, as she described it, he was ""seriously injured"" and that he had ""provided information of his ongoing medical difficulties"", there was no evidence to support the further and what I consider to be the necessary finding that his injuries constituted a serious loss or detriment as might amount to extra-curial punishment in mitigation of sentence.  The injuries suffered by the applicant and their sequelae can be readily distinguished from the injuries and associated ongoing disabilities recognised in Whybrow at [19] and [25] as being capable of being taken into account in mitigation of sentence.
58The third ground of appeal has not been made out.
The fourth ground of appeal
59The applicant submitted that her Honour was in error in allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the early pleas of guilty which, it was submitted, also incorporated ""a discount"" for remorse contrary to Borkowski where at [32] that approach was held to be reflective of error. 
60The applicant relied upon a discrete passage in the sentencing remarks where error of that precise kind is said to be patent.  After referring to the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008,which would have applied had the matter been dealt with in a Sydney trial court rather than at Penrith and where, by operation of section s 17(1)(a) the applicant would have been entitled to a 25 per cent discount as a matter of statute, her Honour said:I have taken into account that the offender made some admissions in his record of interview, and at that time expressed remorse.  He has expressed remorse since then and continues to do so.  It is in all of those circumstances the combination of all of those factors justify a 25 per cent discount on the sentences that would have otherwise been appropriate, had the matters proceeded to trial and verdict.
61When her Honour refers to ""the combination of all those factors justify a 25 per cent discount"" there can be no other interpretation open than that she erroneously included remorse in the quantification of the discount for the plea.  
62In R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [44] this Court held that the correct approach to evidence of remorse in the sentencing exercise is not to provide any separate quantified discount but to afford evidence of remorse appropriate weight a mitigating factor as provided for in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in accordance with the principled approach to sentence the High Court identified in Markarian v R.  
63When her Honour came to consider the various factors relied upon in mitigation of sentence she made express reference again to the issue of remorse where she repeated her finding that the applicant's expressions of remorse were genuine reinforcing what she described as ""the position where he has reached a stage of his life where offending behaviour may become less attractive proposition than has been the case in the past"" (emphasis added).  The applicant submitted that this was a powerful indicator of the applicant's positive prospects of rehabilitation and because of error in her Honour's approach to the quantification of the discount for the plea of guilty this Court would readily conclude that insufficient weight was given to it in the calculation of sentence as a feature of mitigation and that for that reason we should move to re-sentence as a more lenient sentence is warranted as provided for in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
64In Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [21] I observed that:...The limitations on the jurisdiction of this court when entertaining an application for leave to appeal against sentence have been recently restated in Jones v R [2009] NSWCCA 169 at [33]-[34]:
[33] The Court of Criminal Appeal functions within well-established jurisdictional boundaries and is concerned, on an application for leave to appeal against sentence, primarily to ascertain whether the decision of the first-instance Judge was in error: R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353. An appeal to this court is not by way of rehearing, and error must be established before the court may intervene: R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401. This court is bound by findings of fact of the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v R (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504; Kardoulias v R (2005) 159 A Crim R 252 at 265 [56].
[34] To the extent that some of the Applicant's submissions assert that ""insufficient weight"" was given to a factor or that ""appropriate weight"" had not been given to another factor, it is timely to refer to the observation of Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] that ""questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge"" and that ""the circumstances in which matters of 'weight' will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined"".
65The Crown submitted that remorse would only operate as a mitigating factor to the extent that it is coincident with a positive finding that the offender is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation and that her Honour made no such finding in this case having expressed herself in qualified terms at best.  For this reason, so it was submitted, even if error is made out because of her Honour's treatment of issue of remorse when calculating the discount to the plea of guilty, no other sentence is warranted in law.  The Crown submitted that the evidence relied upon for the purposes of re-sentence would not permit this Court to come to any different view than that reached by the sentencing judge as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and that the need for the sentence to reflect the need for punishment, deterrence and denunciation led inevitably to the conclusion that no more lenient sentence in all the circumstances is warranted.  I accept the Crown's submission. 
66The orders I propose are:1.  Leave to appeal against sentence granted.2.  Appeal dismissed.
67GROVE AJ:  I agree with Fullerton J.

		05 July 2012",2012-07-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2707981,R v Pratten (No 10) [2012] NSWSC 1673,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Pratten was judged and found guilty of seven counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception, contrary to the provisions of s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).
	
	
	The verdict of the jury was returned on 13 June 2012. At the time of the trial, which lasted approximately 52 days, and for a significant period prior thereto, Mr Pratten was on bail. On 13 June, following return of the verdict by the jury, I continued the bail pending the outcome of the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	The Crown approaches the court in its jurisdiction under the Bail Act 1978 and, as part of its continuing inherent jurisdiction to deal with orders made by it, to vary the orders in relation to bail by revoking it, because of conduct of Mr Pratten which, the Crown submits, would lead to the conclusion that Mr Pratten is a flight risk and/or otherwise in disregard of the orders of the Court otherwise made, and on that basis ought be refused bail.
	
	
	The further conduct of Mr Pratten is conduct which occurred in or about May 2012 and June 2012, before and after the return of the verdict to which I have referred.
	
	
	The conduct alleged by the Crown is that the accused sought to arrange for a vessel called ""Los Lobos"" to be transported out of the jurisdiction, namely, to Vanuatu, a location which, on the material adduced in the trial, is one to which Mr Pratten has some connection. That conduct, it is said, was a contravention of orders made by this Court on 21 November 2011 to the effect that the vessel Los Lobos, being the property of Astrolabe Services Limited, not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with pursuant to the terms of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).
	
	
	It is a criminal offence under s 37 of the aforesaid Act for a person to dispose or otherwise deal with property in respect of which there is an order of that kind. Mr Pratten has been charged with that contravention. The Crown, being the Commonwealth DPP, does not seek at this point in time to punish Mr Pratten for the contravention of the restraining order, which is a matter currently before the Local Court, and returning to the Local Court on 27 August 2012 but, rather, points to the contravention as indicating a disregard, if not contumelious disregard, of the orders of the Court and, more importantly, given the nature of the contravention, pointing to a capacity to or a willingness to, or evidence of a willingness to flee the jurisdiction himself.
	
	
	The grant of bail pending sentence in circumstances where the sentence involves usually the imposition of a custodial sentence is unusual but was granted in these circumstances because I anticipated that there would be significant debate as to the degree to which Mr Pratten obtained a financial advantage from the Commonwealth for which he was found guilty.
	
	
	Ultimately, none of the parties here, including the Court as presently constituted, are privy to the deliberations of the jury, and those disputed aspects are matters that are highly relevant to the question as to whether a custodial sentence would be appropriate.
	
	
	Whether or not bail is granted, even at this point, is a matter upon which the Court is mandated to consider those matters contained in s 32 of the Bail Act. The two most important aspects, or overriding aspects, of the criteria in s 32 are the risk of flight, as I will call it, and the protection of the community and witnesses in the proceedings.
	
	
	The risk of flight is particularised in a number of ways. It is referred to in s 32(1)(a) of the Bail Act as the probability of whether or not the person will appear in court in respect of the offence for which bail has been considered, and includes the person's background and community ties, any previous failure to appear, the circumstances of the offence, and any evidence of a probability that he will not appear, and includes such factors as the likelihood that there will be a substantial period of imprisonment imposed, the need to be free to prepare a case, et cetera. I do not read all of the sections or provisions.
	
	
	The conduct in seeking to arrange for the boat to leave the jurisdiction, if true, is conduct that is, and should be, of great concern to the Court, because it reflects a disregard to the orders of the Court and a willingness to engage in conduct known to be unlawful. I have accepted for the purpose of these proceedings that organising for the property to be transported out of the jurisdiction is to deal with the property and, therefore, constrained by the terms of the order issued by the Court under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
	
	
	Other factors going to the question of the grant or refusal of bail or its revocation are the other legitimate interests that Mr Pratten has in being at liberty, and they include the fact that he has care of his older daughter, who is sixteen years of age, and the fact that he has a number of other communal ties. Certainly he is required to assist in the preparation of his sentencing proceedings, which will not be uncomplicated because no special verdict is available, and some of the facts adduced at trial may give rise to quite complicated aspects with which the Court will need to deal during the course of the sentencing procedure.
	
	
	The other aspect with which the Court is required to deal is the question of the protection of the community and the protection and welfare of the community. To the extent that one confines oneself to the contravention of the Proceeds of Crime order it is noteworthy that the property that was sought to be dealt with has since been transferred to the public trustee, by order of Schmidt J made on 28 June 2012, which was executed on 29 June 2012. All of the other property to which restraining order relates is property that is fixed or registered in Australia, being real property or shares in Australian companies.
	
	
	As a consequence, the likelihood of a repetition of this particular offence is limited.
	
	
	As to the offences for which Mr Pratten was convicted, the likelihood of them being repeated is, one would think, extremely limited, in the circumstances that they were offences associated with the non-declaration of income.
	
	
	It seems to me that there is no serious risk relating to the protection of the community or its welfare with Mr Pratten being on conditional liberty. It also seems, and I am satisfied that, there are interests of Mr Pratten which inform a view that he should remain on conditional liberty and the only - and I do not use the word ""only"" to minimise it - but the only remaining consideration is the risk of flight.
	
	
	As to the risk of flight, it seems to me that there are two or three aspects. The first is, as I said, the care of his older child. The second is his financial ties to the community generally. The third is the history that Mr Pratten has displayed in terms of his behaviour on conditional liberty.
	
	
	We have had two offences, or two breaches of the bail conditions. The first is a breach of bail condition by altering residential address without earlier informing the law enforcement authorities and seeking an alteration to the bail conditions, for which breach Mr Pratten spent, it seems, one day in custody. And now we have had the alleged contravention of the restraining order, which would be a breach of the condition to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	Against that it has to be said Mr Pratten has been under a charge for serious offences since 2010, over two years. He has been in the trial, as I said, for fifty-two days, and attended on each occasion that was necessary, and upon which he was before the Court. He is here today. Each of those attendances speaks in favour of his ability to turn up for proceedings when they occur.
	
	
	Mr Pratten's passport is currently in possession of the law enforcement authorities, and he has daily reporting conditions. It seems to me it is a very fine issue. On the one hand we have the disregard of orders of the Court. It seems to me, however, that the disregard of the orders of the Court is a matter that is the subject of current criminal proceedings, and to the extent that they require punishment, will be punished in those proceedings.
	
	
	To the extent that they are relevant to the question of flight risk it seems to me that the countervailing factors outweigh that factor and, subject to two matters, I am prepared to continue bail.
	
	
	The two matters are that the conduct seems to me to raise the risk of flight, albeit not to a level that I would refuse bail, but I will vary the bail conditions that are necessary in order for Mr Pratten to continue to be on conditional liberty in the following way:

		29 April 2016",2012-07-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708004,"WHELAN, Heath Andrew v R [2012] NSWCCA 147","Judgment

1ALLSOP P: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons in draft of Schmidt J. I agree with the orders that her Honour proposes and with her reasons. I would only add the following.

2Causation is an issue that has been the subject of much debate and some legislation in the civil sphere. In crime, it remains, in many contexts, a jury question and is governed by the test in Royall v R [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378. The question is one of fact, dealt with by commonsense, appreciating that the purpose of the enquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter, and so the causal connection must be sufficiently substantial to permit a conclusion of criminal responsibility. The trial judge so directed the jury. The section (s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) requires a causal connection between the vehicle (driven in the required way) and an impact, and the death of a person. Here, the person who died was an infant, who at the time of the impact could not be the victim of a crime of violence: Co. Inst, Pt III, Ch 7, p 50, cited in Attorney-General's Reference (No 3 of 1994) [1998] AC 245 at 254. Nevertheless, the impact that causes the premature birth of the foetus as the living child who, after a passage of time alive, dies because of an inability to withstand the rigours of his or her environment, can be said to have occasioned the death of a person, even though that person was not alive at the time of the impact. The causal connection is a factual one for the assessment of the jury. Here, no argument was put that the conclusion drawn by the jury was not reasonably and properly open beyond reasonable doubt.

3As to the sentence imposed, it was not vitiated by any error. No rule of law, or principle, or precept required the imprisonment of this man. An intensive correctional order was available. The lack of likely repetition of the offence did not deny the relevance of two aspects of the order: the degree of denunciation implicit in the order to a person of Mr Whelan's character; and, secondly, the utility expressed in the assessment report of Mr Whelan undergoing a driving programme and a counselling programme.

4The consideration and choice of a sentence for an offence contrary to s 52A(1) may be one of extraordinary difficulty. A sentencing judge may well be faced with an offender of otherwise good character who faces the potentially catastrophic consequences of imprisonment. Yet, that offender has taken the life of another by the kind of misconduct in paragraph (a), (b) or (c). The views expressed in many cases such as R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 reflect the fact that the charge of a motor vehicle is one that is of great responsibility. The community expects such instruments of danger to be controlled responsibly. General and specific deterrence are important as is the statement of the sentencing court of the public denunciation of dangerous driving. That does not, however, require that every error of judgment, tragic in its consequences, demands incarceration. If it be necessary to state it for any judicial officer, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 5(1) requires that a court not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. The evaluation, here, by the sentencing judge, of an appropriate non-custodial sentence was, in my view, both reasonable and just.

5DAVIES J:I agree with Schmidt J and with the additional remarks of Allsop P. 

6SCHMIDT J: In May 2009, the appellant, Heath Andrew Whelan, was driving home from work at about 4.30am. He encountered a convoy of four 4 wheel drive vehicles, each towing a boat, heading in the same direction. After pulling out to overtake, he collided head on with a vehicle being driven in the opposite direction, by Mr Naresh Kumar. With Mr Kumar were his pregnant wife, Shweta Kapur, their 12 year old son and Mr Kumar's mother, Ms Rampyari. Ms Kapur was injured, suffering amongst other injuries, a placental abruption. Her baby, Samanvaya, was born prematurely about 4 days after the accident. He died on 23 June 2009. 

7The appellant was charged with two offences under s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, one under s 52A(3) in respect of Ms Kapur and the other under s 52A(1)(c) in respect of Samanvaya. Sections 52A(1) and (3) provide:

""52A Dangerous driving: substantive matters

(1) Dangerous driving occasioning death
A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:
(a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug, or
(b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or
(c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.
A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.

...

(3) Dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm
A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:
(a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug, or
(b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or
(c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.""


8The trial judge gave a directed verdict in relation to the offence concerning Ms Kapur, taking the view that the evidence that Ms Kapur had suffered placental abruption and bruising, was not evidence upon which the jury could conclude that she had suffered grievous bodily harm, as that term is defined in s 4 of the Crimes Act. That definition is:

""Grievous bodily harm includes:

(a) the destruction (other than in the course of a medical procedure) of the foetus of a pregnant woman, whether or not the woman suffers any other harm, and

(b) any permanent or serious disfiguring of the person, and

(c) any grievous bodily disease (in which case a reference to the infliction of grievous bodily harm includes a reference to causing a person to contract a grievous bodily disease).""


9Her Honour refused to give such a direction in relation to the charge concerning Samanvaya, rejecting the case advanced for the appellant, that in order for an offence under s 52A(1)(c) to be established, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt, that his death was the result of injuries inflicted during the accident, while he was still a foetus in the womb. 

10On 12 August 2011, the accused was convicted by a jury of the charge concerning Samanvaya. On 11 November 2011, Quick DCJ sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, to be served by way of an intensive correction order.

11The appellant appeals this conviction under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and the Crown appeals the sentence imposed under s 5D. The grounds of the conviction appeal are:

""The learned trial Judge erred in law by holding that the Indictment presented against the Appellant was capable of sustaining a verdict of guilty upon a count of driving a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to other persons whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Samanvaya Kumar (""Samanvaya"") was occasioned and, in holding there was a case for the Appellant to answer, misdirected herself as to the necessary elements of proof of that count.

Particulars:

1.Her Honour erred in holding that it was not necessary for an injury to be sustained by Samanvaya while a foetus in utero;

2.Alternatively, her Honour erred in holding that it was not necessary for an intentional act causing Samanvaya to be born in a state much less capable of living, being a situation in which he could not live, and afterwards dying in consequence of its exposure to the external world.""


12The grounds of the sentence appeal are:

""1.UPON THE GROUND that the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.

2.Her Honour erred in determining the degree of moral culpability for this offence as being at a low level.""


The evidence

13The appellant did not give evidence at the trial, but admitted that he had driven in a manner dangerous to other persons. His admissions became exhibit A in the proceedings, which provided that:

""In respect of these criminal proceedings, on 8 August 2011 the abovenamed Accused makes the following admissions as to matters of fact pursuant to section 184/191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):

1.That, on 17 May 2009 at Oran Park in the state of New South Wales, Heath Andrew Whelan did drive a motor vehicle, namely a black Ford utility, registration AQ59YN in a manner dangerous to other persons whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact with a motor vehicle, namely a green Mitsubishi Magna, registration YJA177 in which Shweta Kapur was a passenger.

2.At the time of the impact Shweta Kapur was approximately 24 weeks pregnant.

3.On 21 May 2009 Shweta Kapur gave birth to a baby Samanvaya Kumar, who died on 23 June 2009.""



14Ms Kapur gave evidence, as did Mr Kumar and Ms Rampyari. The occupants of the vehicle which the appellant overtook, the driver Mr Piirlaid and his passengers, Mr Lucas Rosman and Mr Nicholas Rosman, were also called. The Crown also called evidence from Dr Ahmed, a senior registrar of obstetrics, who examined Ms Kapur at Liverpool Hospital after her admission; Dr Tobiansky, a neonatologist; Dr D'Cruz, who treated Samanvaya in hospital; Dr Evans, a neonatal paediatrician, head of the Department of Neonatal Medicine at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney. Senior Constable Jenkins, the officer in charge of the investigation also gave evidence.

15Samanvaya's birth was due in September 2009. Ms Kapur had been in India between 18 February and 24 March. While there she had an ultrasound, which did not detect any complications with the pregnancy. After her return she was referred by her doctor to Blacktown Hospital, where she saw a midwife for an ante natal check up, which was also normal.

16On 17 May, Ms Kapur was in the front passenger seat, wearing a seatbelt, when the accident occurred. It was still dark at the time and the conditions were dry. She said that the car was travelling at between 60 and 65 km per hour, when she saw a ute crossing into their lane. Her husband blew his horn and swerved to the left to avoid a collision, but the vehicles hit. Ms Kapur then felt pain in the right side of her abdomen. Their car halted near a tree, blocking the passenger door, so that she could not get out. Her husband was also trapped, but people assisted Ms Rampyari and her son get out of the car. 

17Emergency service workers cut the tree and removed panels from the car, to get Ms Kapur out and she was taken by ambulance to Liverpool hospital between 6.00am and 6.30am. She had bruising on the right side of her abdomen, but the baby was found to be alive and she was given various medical treatment. 

18Samanvaya was born on 21 May, weighing only 750 grams. He went into neonatal intensive care, where initially he progressed well, being fed breast milk through a tube and putting on weight. After 33 days, he suddenly became ill and died. Because of the family's religious beliefs, no autopsy was performed.

19Mr Kumar's evidence was that the appellant's car came suddenly across the unbroken line into his lane and he tried to avoid the accident, but they hit on the left side of the road. He was trapped in the car by the legs. His wife was not able to get out and was crying in pain in her stomach, but his son was able to get out. 

20Mr Piirlaid was in his car with Lucas and Nicholas Rosman. His evidence was that he was towing a 19 foot half cabin boat, travelling at the speed limit of 80 km, about 60 metres behind the car in front. He was on a sweeping right hand bend when he noticed the ute which the appellant was driving coming up behind him, quite quickly. They were about one quarter of the way through the bend, with the ute travelling at substantial speed, a lot faster than him, when the ute raced past him on the inside, and then passed him on double white lines around a blind corner, where there was only one lane in either direction. The next vehicle was still 60 metres in front. As the ute came up to the back of the boat of the car in front of him, he noticed a set of headlights coming the other way. 

21Mr Pirrlaid's evidence as to what then occurred should be quoted. He said:
""A. I saw the ute speed up as he was going past the boat and car and then tried to pull in between the cars, well just slightly tried to pull in, not a proper go and then get back into the wrong side of the lane and try and speed up again.

Q.And did it stay travelling in a straight line in the lane on the opposite side of the road or did you see it change direction at all?
A.No, only just when he tried to pull in. [STRIKE OUT BEGINS] I'm sure he would have observed the car coming the other way --[STRIKE OUT ENDS]""


22Mr Piirlaid said that the ute spun around and ended up sideways in the middle of the road and the other car was on the side down an embankment. Mr Piirlaid stopped and went to that car.

23Mr Lucas Rosman's evidence was to very different effect. He said that he was with Mr Piirlaid and his brother. The car was travelling 70-80km, doing the speed limit. His evidence about the appellant's car was that:
""A.He come around us, we noticed he went past, he put his foot down, he kept going around past the next car with boat and then kept going again and tried to overtake the third car with the boat and that's when the accident happened.

Q.And can you describe what you saw in terms of the two cars, colliding?
A.I seen the other car coming, I seen the headlights and then I've seen the tail lights and he was next to the car with the boat and then I seen the headlights veer off from the car coming towards us and then they both veered the same way and hit.""


24 Mr Lucas Rosman then went to assist. The woman in the front seat said that she had pains in her stomach. In cross-examination, as to the speed of the car he was in, Mr Lucas Rosman said that it was 70, 80, 75 km. 

25Mr Nicholas Rosman's evidence was that the car which overtook them was going a lot quicker than they were and that;
""A.... and then all I remember is seeing the car ahead of us trying to veer to the left but he was next to another car and boat and then because he veered to the lift(sic) there were comes(sic) coming the other way, without headlights on the other car and then I just remember them quickly seeing them both veer to the right hand side of the road and then yeah they had the accident.""



26Mr Nicholas Rosman said that the accident happened in the right hand lane. He also explained why he could not go to the assistance of those involved. 

27Dr Ahmed's evidence was that on admission Ms Kapur was complaining of abdominal pain and was found to have bruising in her lower abdomen, but was not contracting and there was then no vaginal bleeding. On ultrasound examination, however, the placenta was found to have separated from the wall of the uterus. He explained that it was usual for pregnant patients in a motor vehicle accident to be observed for signs of placenta abruption. The baby was otherwise fine and blood flow was good, but given the significant placental separation, preterm delivery was anticipated. Considering the baby's extreme prematurity, steroid treatment was given to enhance the baby's lung maturity. 

28Dr Ahmed explained that Ms Kapur wanted everything done for her baby, but she progressed to preterm labour on 22 May.

29It was Dr Ahmed's opinion that Ms Kapur suffered significant abdominal trauma from the accident, which resulted in the separation of a large area of the placenta from its attachment to the wall of the uterus, which led to preterm labour and delivery. 

30Dr Tobiansky gave evidence about the treatment which Samanvaya received during his 33 days in neonatal intensive care. He explained that a 25 week foetus is not well adapted to life outside the womb; their lungs and organs are not adapted, their brains are often immature and their eyes can get damaged from oxygen. It is difficult to feed them; they can get brain haemorrhages; they don't absorb milk readily and quickly; the bacteria in their bowels is not the same as that of full-term infants; and they have mucosa very susceptible to damage from infection and lack of oxygen,

31Dr Tobiansky explained that it is usual for such babies to have immature lungs which require breathing support, which is provided by continuous positive airway pressure. This helps the lungs stay open, otherwise the lungs would collapse. This is a lesser form of support than ventilation. Samanvaya was treated for respiratory disease, jaundice and patent ductus arteriosus, all common problems of babies born at 25 weeks gestation. 

32Jaundice is a common condition in preterm babies, because of the immaturity of their liver, but it is a condition which even full-term babies suffer. It was treated with photo therapy. Patent ductus arteriosus is a condition where the connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta does not close in the usual way when the baby is exposed to oxygen and the placenta is taken away, with the result, circulation changes which close the ductus. This was treated with medication. Samanvaya also contracted a staph aureus infection in his blood on 31 May 2009, which was treated with antibiotics. 

33At day 33, Samanvaya developed a less common complication of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis ('NEC'), the result of a perforated intestine. Despite treatment, he died that day. In Dr Tobiansky's opinion, the cause of death was not the motor vehicle accident, but the NEC, which Dr Tonbiansky explained could be of differing severity. In this case, it was fulminant NEC, the very worst kind, resulting in a dead or perforated bowel, which requires surgery. That was not possible in Samanvaya's case. Blood cultures did not show that this NEC was caused by bacteria. X ray established that there was a hole in the bowel. 

34Even though there had been no post-mortem undertaken, so that another cause of death could not be excluded, Dr Tobiansky's opinion was that there was no other substantial or significant cause of death than NEC. The clinical and radiological picture, as well as Samanvaya's symptoms, rapid deterioration and failure to respond to resuscitative treatment, all indicated the cause to have been NEC. Dr Tobiansky explained that preterm babies such as Samanvaya were at high risk of developing NEC because of the immaturity of key functions such as gastrointestinal motility, digestive ability, circulatory regulation, intestinal barrier function and immune defence. In his opinion NEC was the cause of death. Any other cause was unlikely. A possible cause such as fungal infection would not present in such a rapid manner as occurred here. In his opinion other causes were academic.

35Dr Tobiansky also said that in his view the accident caused the placental abruption. There were other possible causes, but there was no evidence that they were present here. The likely contributing factors to the development of Samanvaya's NEC were lack of oxygen, blood supply to the gut, and maturity of the gut. The treatment of the duct into the pulmonary artery, could also cause decreased blood supply to the renal arties. Dr Tobiansky explained that the immaturity of the gut at 25 weeks made such babies more susceptible to such problems. The other difficulty for preterm babies was that prior to birth, they did not get the good bacteria which they required in their gut, which left them vulnerable to bad bacteria. This was why NEC was a disease of preterm infants, especially those with very low birth weights below 1500 grams. In term babies NEC was associated with different complications.

36Dr Evan's evidence was that a baby born at 25 weeks gestation would die without intensive support. Support in the neonatal intensive care unit was directed to supporting the baby's life sustaining systems to allow them to grow to such a time that they could live independently. In a baby in Samanvaya's circumstances, that would often take several months. 

37Dr Evan's opinion was that this pregnancy was uncomplicated until the time of the accident. The baby was delivered in good condition, with various normal measures taken at birth. His sudden deterioration and death occurred, despite extensive resuscitative efforts, such as intubation, ventilation, adrenaline and alkaline treatment to improve blood circulation, drug treatment to help the heart and attempts at draining the peritoneal cavity. 

38Dr D'Cruz signed the death certificate identifying the cause of Samanvaya's death to be NEC 'due to extreme prematurity'. Dr D'Cruz explained the treatment he was given and his rapid deterioration, despite extensive resuscitative measures. It was Dr D'Cruz's opinion that the motor vehicle accident did not cause Samanvaya's death, it was caused by NEC, which was a well known complication of extreme prematurity. She agreed, in cross-examination, however, that because there was no autopsy or post mortem, some other cause of death could not be ruled out.

39Ms Kapur's symptoms and the findings of ultrasound examination suggested that the likely cause of the placental abruption was the collision. Trauma was a well recognised cause of such abruption. While there could not be one hundred per cent certainty, the evidence made another cause unlikely in the extreme. It was highly unlikely that there would have been a premature birth, had Ms Kapur not been involved in this accident. NEC was predominantly a disease of babies born before 30 weeks, which occurred rarely in late preterm or term babies. NEC was a rare but well recognised condition. In Dr Evan's opinion in this case another cause of death was very unlikely. The symptoms pointed to infection. He explained that none of the body systems of a baby born this early, are ready for the outside world, including their immune systems. They are particularly vulnerable to infections, including NEC.

40In cross-examination, Dr Evans explained that even if Samanvaya had survived the NEC, there were still other problems caused by his prematurity, but the odds would then have been in his favour. While there had been cases where a cluster of NEC cases had occurred in a prenatal ward, that was seen less nowadays than in the 1970s and 1980s. Dr Evans also described treatment of NEC by removal of a section of bowel, which depended on the baby's stability, the rate of onset of the NEC and the baby's ability to tolerate surgery. In the case of rapid onset of NEC, as here, an operation such as this was not possible. 

41Senior Constable Jenkins gave evidence about the scene of the accident, which she attended, where she found Ms Kapur and Mr Kumar trapped in their car and the appellant trapped in his. They were all extracted and taken to hospital. Video footage was taken from a police vehicle driven along the road, during daylight hours, at the scene of the accident. This video was played to the jury and to this Court on appeal. The video showed where the vehicles came to rest after the accident and the nature of the road, which at some points had double lines and at others, broken lines. Senior Constable Jenkins, in her evidence, explained what this footage showed. She had also prepared a map of the accident site, with various measurements there depicted, which was tendered. 

42The appellant gave evidence on sentencing. He was then aged 36 years. His evidence was that the accident occurred while he was driving home to Camden, from Penrith Panthers Leagues Club where he worked as a security guard. He was himself injured in the accident, suffering a fractured right femur and a pulmonary embolism. His vehicle, which was not comprehensively insured, was written off. 

43The appellant said that the accident occurred after he decided to overtake a vehicle towing a boat on a stretch of the road where there was a broken white line and he had a clear vision ahead, to the point of a corner ahead. After pulling out he found that the first car and trailer had closed up to the next car and trailer, so that there was no gap between them. He decided to continue overtaking, because he found that he could not move in between the last and second last vehicles. At that point he had not seen the oncoming car and thought he had time to overtake the second vehicle. When he saw the oncoming vehicle, he checked to see if he could move left, but did not have enough room and felt that he did not have enough time to brake and pull behind the car he had already overtaken. He decided to swerve off the road on the right side, to avoid the oncoming vehicle. The oncoming vehicle also swerved left and they then collided. He estimated that the time from when he went to overtake until the collision occurred, was approximately 20 seconds.

44The appellant was hospitalised for some time and then on 20 June 2009 participated in an ERISP interview with police in which he admitted that he had overtaken the vehicle. He also made admissions as to his manner of driving and that he had made a bad decision to overtake. He said that he had apologised to Mr Kumar at the scene of the collision. He explained that he felt very bad about the baby's death and with the assistance of his family, had later provided financial support and other assistance to the Kumar family, when they encountered financial difficulties after the accident. This included lending them a car for some four months; later providing them money to purchase another car; paying their son's school fees; and assisting with the cost of an airfare for Ms Rampyari travel home to India. There was documentary material tendered which supported this evidence. 

45Evidence as to the appellant's army service record was also tendered. He had trained as a paratrooper; had served some 11 years; had twice been on active duty in East Timor and once in the Solomon Islands; and had been awarded a number of medals for his conduct. He was injured during training and as a consequence of his resulting incapacity, he could no longer meet the physical requirements of his job and had retired. 

46The applicant had a driving record, including most recently a license suspension in September 2005 for loss of points. There had also been an assault charge when he was aged 19.

47The appellant was cross examined. He had seen the plan prepared by Senior Constable Jenkins and agreed as to the accuracy of the measurements she had made, but not her assessment of the distance from the corner, to where the accident occurred. His recollection was that it occurred before the corner. He had also seen the video which identified the tree where the vehicle came to rest, but believed that it was not the same tree. The appellant was questioned about the place that he commenced overtaking the vehicle ahead of him, which he said was as soon as the line became broken; the distance between him and the vehicle which he overtook, which he said was about 10 metres; the speed that the vehicle in front was travelling, which he said was not the speed limit of 80 when he began to overtake. He explained that the speed of Mr Pirrlaid's vehicle had earlier varied, slowing down and speeding up, depending on the road. 

48The appellant was also cross-examined as to his own speed. He said that was 80 or 85 km per hour; he said he did not recall travelling at 110 km; he insisted that he had only attempted to overtake one vehicle before he had become aware that the distance between it and the next vehicle had narrowed. The appellant agreed that he had often driven that road when he was younger and during the three weeks that he had worked at Penrith Panthers Leagues Club and that he was aware that there were regular overtaking lanes a couple of kilometres ahead. He agreed that he had visibility of some 330 metres, when he went to overtake, up to the corner and that he could not see what was around the bend. He was certain that from the time he pulled out to the time of the collision was about 20 seconds, explaining that it happened very fast and so could not have been more than that and not as long as 30 seconds. He did not agree that he had travelled in excess of 400 metres, before the accident occurred. He insisted that he was attempting to overtake one boat and vehicle, not three.

49The appellant was also cross-examined about his driving record of about a dozen speeding offences and one disqualification. He agreed that he was on notice that this record would get him into trouble, if he drove above the speed limit.

50It should be observed that various aspects of the appellant's evidence was corroborated by the evidence of Ms Kapur and Mr Kumar, Mr Piirlaid and Mr Lucas Rosman.

The sentencing judgment

51Her Honour noted that she was obliged to form her own view of the facts, so long as they did not conflict with that of the jury, its verdict not identifying the precise facts which it must have accepted, in order to convict the appellant. 

52Her Honour began by observing that while there was some conflicting evidence as to the speed at which the appellant was driving, the Crown explained in its submissions on sentencing, that it was the manner of the appellant's driving and not his speed, which was relied on. Her Honour explained that she understood from those submissions, that it was the overtaking of a vehicle or vehicles in the way alleged by some of the Crown witnesses, which constituted the dangerous driving.

53Her Honour explained the circumstances in which the accident occurred, in terms which were not challenged. She then referred to the appellant's evidence as to the circumstances in which the accident occurred and his admissions as to dangerous driving, which had the result that the Crown had not called expert or scientific evidence to prove the dangerous driving in question. Her Honour noted the evidence called from Constable Jenkins, but observed that 'there is no scientific evidence before me to establish a number of propositions put by the Crown, including the location of the collision. 

54Her Honour then turned to the evidence of Mr Piirlaid and Lucas and Nicholas Rosman, Mr Kumar and Ms Kapur. She observed that:

""Although the Crown contends that the offender continued driving on the wrong side of the road a distance of some 450 metres before the collision occurred, this version appears to be inconsistent with the evidence of Shweta Kapur and her husband Naresh Kumar, namely that the ute suddenly moved onto their side of the road. Their version is more consistent with the offender's version, that he tried to regain his correct side of the road but was unable to do so because of lack of space and decided to overtake the second vehicle when he thought he had time to do so. Clearly he was in error when he made that decision.

Although the three men travelling in the last car of the convoy gave evidence of a significant gap between their vehicle and the vehicle in front of them, they were not particularly impressive witnesses. Mr Pirrlaid in particular was keen to volunteer evidence that he thought would discredit the offender. He had an interest in denying travelling too close to the vehicle ahead of him and thus avoiding any blame for the accident.

I accept the offender's version that he had intended to overtake only one vehicle, and did so at a time when he had a clear vision and an unbroken centre line in his direction but was unable to regain his correct side of the road because of insufficient room between that vehicle and the vehicle in front of it. I accept the estimate of speed given by the offender, which was around eighty to eighty-five kilometres per hour. As I have said, there is no scientific or expert evidence called because of the admission by the offender and evidence. This is not meant as a criticism of the Crown, as it was not an issue which needed determination by a jury.



55 Her Honour then turned to the evidence as to the injuries which Ms Kapur suffered; and the baby's birth, treatment and death. She then dealt with the appellant's subjective features, noting the contents of a presentence report and the evidence which the appellant had given, including his acceptance of his responsibly for his actions and the assistance which he had provided the Kumar family. Her Honour said that:

""When giving evidence before me, the offender impressed me as genuine, straightforward and someone who is sincerely deeply remorseful for his offending behaviour.""


56Her Honour then noted authorities which bound her, quoting from R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209; (1998) 101 A Crim R 259 and R v Whyte [2002] 55 NSWLR 252. She noted the guidance there provided, in the context of the appellant's circumstances, as well as the Chief Justice's observations in Whyte, that in the case of an offence such as here in question, a custodial sentence will usually be appropriate 'unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement' (at [214]. Her Honour also referred to Simpson J's explanation in R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32 at [31] of the shades and grades of moral culpability in different instances of a s 52A offence and the need to recognise a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, when assessing moral culpability.

57Her Honour noted that the Crown's case was that the appellant's moral culpability was high, amounting to an abandonment of his responsibility, which over a period of approximately 30 seconds exposed the occupants of at least four other vehicles to significant danger. The Crown relied on three aggravating factors to advance this case, namely the number of people put at risk, the erratic nature of the driving and the length of time that others were exposed to risk. 

58Her Honour did not accept that it had been established that the time in question was 30 seconds, that figure resting on calculations made by Senior Constable Jenkins; or that the occupants of four other vehicles were put at risk; or that there was erratic or aggressive driving. Her Honour concluded that the evidence established that the occupants of two other vehicles had been put at risk by the appellant's dangerous driving.

59Her Honour referred to the appellant's driving record, in determining the appropriate sentence, and also had regard to issues of personal and general deterrence and retribution. She also noted the Crown submission that a minor reduction in sentence should result from the admissions made prior to trial, which had obviated the need to called extensive expert evidence, which had shortened the trial markedly.

60Her Honour then noted the case advanced for the appellant and concluded that the evidence had established that in the course of lawfully overtaking, the appellant had found himself in a situation where there were motor vehicles ahead and he was unable to regain his correct side of the road, because of lack of space. As to his record, her Honour noted an offence in May 2010 of driving with a hand held mobile, which led her to the view that his pattern of committing traffic offences on a regular basis appeared to have come to an end in 2005 when he achieved some maturity, but that this latter offence did not permit the view that the appellant was unlikely to re-offend in any way. Her Honour concluded, nevertheless, that the evidence did leave open a finding that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.

61Her Honour also accepted that the evidence established that the appellant was profoundly remorseful for the death he had caused and that his acceptance of his responsibility and his remorse had been demonstrated in a number of ways, which she described. Her Honour noted the importance of general deterrence and retribution featuring in the sentence imposed, but also noted that there was in this case no drugs, alcohol or of the other aggravating factors discussed in Whyte present. In the result her Honour came to the view that the appellant's offending involved a low level of moral culpability.

62Her Honour then turned to the JIRS statistics, noting that 45% of some 182 offenders had received a full-time custodial sentence, for a s 52A(1) offence, 19% had received periodic detention, 18% a suspended sentence and the remainder bonds, community service or home detention.

63Having in mind the low level of moral culpability which she had found, the mitigating matters she had outlined and the appellant's strong subjective circumstances, her Honour came to the view that the appellant's sentence should be served by way of an intensive correction order under s 7(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The appellant had been assessed as suitable for such an order. Various conditions were imposed by her Honour, including as to reporting and surveillance, community service, undertaking activities to address his offending, as defined in the assessment report. Her Honour also imposed an 18 month license disqualification. 

The conviction appeal

1.Her Honour erred in holding that it was not necessary for an injury to be sustained by Samanvaya while a foetus in utero;

2.Alternatively, her Honour erred in holding that it was not necessary for an intentional act causing Samanvaya to be born in a state much less capable of living, being a situation in which he could not live, and afterwards dying in consequence of its exposure to the external world.""

64Both grounds of appeal may conveniently be dealt with together. In my view neither ground was established.

65In written submissions the case advanced for the appellant accepted that a child injured in utero, during an impact with a motor vehicle in which the child in utero was being conveyed, who was subsequently born alive, lived independently and dies as the result of the injuries sustained in the accident, is a person for the purposes of s 52A of the Crimes Act (see R v F (1996) 40 NSWLR 245). 

66Relying on R v F and Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1994) [1996] QB 581 at 583, it was submitted, however, that her Honour had erred in not accepting that the occasioning of an actual injury to the foetus in utero was fundamental to the question of criminal liability, in the case of a charge under s 52A. In the alternative, it was submitted that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the state of the child was such that when born, it was unlikely or unable to survive. 

67It was also submitted that the elements essential to be established on the Crown case were:

""a.an intentional act causing the child to be born in a state much less capable of living,

b.being a situation in which it cannot live, and 

c.the child afterwards dying in consequence of its exposure to the external world.""



68In the result, it was argued, in this case her Honour erred in not directing the jury to find the accused not guilty of the s 52A(1) charge relating to Samanvaya, given that he had not been injured in the accident and had lived and thrived for 33 days, before his death. This submission rested on R v West [1848] 175 ER 329; 2 Car & P 784, Attorney General's Reference (No 3); various texts, as well as R v Iby [2005] NSWCCA 178; (2005) 154 A Crim R 55 at 64. 

69The Crown's case was that both grounds of appeal raised aspects of causation. In oral submissions, it was accepted for the appellant that the Crown's submissions as to causation, resting as they did on the test for causation discussed in Royall v R [1991] 172 CLR 378, had force. That must be accepted. There the High Court was concerned with the directions given a jury in a murder trial, including the directions as to the particular acts, any one of which the jury might regard as the cause of the deceased's death in that case. Causation was put to the jury as a matter of fact, which they had to decide. At 387 it was observed by Mason CJ:

""The issue of causation was left to the jury to decide as one of fact. In this respect I agree with the statement made by Burt C.J. in Campbell v. The Queen, at p 290; (1980) 2 A Crim R 157, at p 161, that it is ""enough if juries (are) told that the question of cause for them to decide is not a philosophical or a scientific question, but a question to be determined by them applying their common sense to the facts as they find them, they appreciating that the purpose of the enquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter""; see also Timbu Kolian v. The Queen [1968] HCA 66; (1968) 119 CLR 47, per Windeyer J. at p 69. That is the test that has been applied in negligence cases by this Court: see March v. E and M.H. Stramare Pty. Ltd. [1991] HCA 12; (1991) 65 ALJR 334; 99 ALR 423. Although the trial judge's direction was not so explicit, the jury would have plainly understood it in the sense expressed in the statement just quoted.""


70Dawson and Dean JJ also referred to Burt CJ's observation in Campbell v the Queen, adding at 412:

""It may not be possible to take the matter usefully much beyond that. No doubt in some cases of murder it may assist the jury if the trial judge points out not only that there must be a causal connection between the acts (or, more rarely, omissions) of the accused and the death of the deceased, but that the causal connection must be sufficiently substantial to enable responsibility for the crime to be attributed to the accused. However, in many cases of murder, particularly where a single act such as shooting or stabbing is alleged, it may be unnecessary to elaborate the requirement that the death should have been caused by the accused. In other cases it may be appropriate to point out that the causal chain must not be broken by some intervening event which operates to relieve the accused of responsibility, but such a direction would ordinarily be better put by reference to the actual facts of the case than couched in abstract terms.""


71In this case, at trial the defence case was that while the appellant had admitted dangerous driving, the jury would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that causation had been proven, given the evidence that the baby had been healthy at birth, but had later died after developing NEC. It was submitted that the evidence was that the accident had caused the premature birth, but not the baby's death. It was also argued that the Crown had not shown that the appellant occasioned or caused the baby's death, because on the evidence, another substantial or significant cause of death could not be excluded. 

72Whether or not the causal chain on which the Crown relied was established on the evidence, was a matter for the jury. The trial judge directed the jury that:
""As to ""occasioned or caused the death"" the law is, as the Crown opened to you, and the question you are to determine, applying your commonsense, understanding that you are deciding legal responsibility in a criminal trial, is whether the motor vehicle accident was a substantial or significant cause of the death of Samanvaya Kumar. That is basically what the Crown said to you yesterday.

Another way to put the question is whether the motor vehicle accident is so connected with the death of Samanvaya that it must be regarded as having sufficiently substantive casual effect, which continued up to the time of his death or the happening of his death, without being spent or sufficiently interrupted by another act or another event. If you find beyond reasonable doubt that the impact of the motor vehicle collision significantly or substantially contributed to the death of Samanvaya, then the appropriate verdict is guilty. If you have a reasonable doubt that the impact made a significant or substantial contribution uninterrupted by some other event or act then the appropriate verdict is not guilty.""


73Her Honour also directed that the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accident resulted in the placental separation; that it was the cause of the premature labour, another link in the chain of causation; and that the baby who was born alive prematurely, died of a complication of prematurity some 5 weeks later, NEC being a rare condition, primarily a disease of preterm infants, which can also occur in full term babies. Her Honour also explained that the accident did not have to be the sole or direct and immediate cause of death, but that it must make a substantial or significant contribution.

74Her Honour also explained the Crown case and the appellant's case. As to the Crown case she directed:

""The Crown case is that the links in the chain are made out and that you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that following the impact the mother, Shweta Kapur, had a ""placenta abrupta"" at that time, and not at any other time - that it was occasioned by the motor accident, and that was followed by the premature birth, and that the FNEC was a complication of his prematurity rather than anything else.


'''
The Crown submission to you is that the act of the accused in these circumstances, when you consider all of what occurred following the impact in commonsense way, you would find that the motor accident, which was caused by an act of the accused, significantly contributed or substantially contributed to the death of Samanvaya.""


75As to the appellant's case she directed:

""Mr Greenhill, on the other hand, said the baby was doing very well, he was a healthy premature neonate, he was progressing well, he had had complication but he was getting through those.""



76After dealing with other matters, her Honour directed:

""In summary then, the Crown argues that the condition developed by the baby Samanvaya was an ultimate consequence of the motor accident and that the motor accident was a substantial or significant cause of the death and that you would be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt.

Mr Greenhill's argument is that another substantial or significant cause of death can not be excluded. If one cannot be excluded then there must be a verdict of not guilty. 

If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the motor accident was a significant or substantial cause of the death of Samanvaya then the appropriate verdict is guilty'. P 23""


77On appeal it was not suggested that there was any error in these directions. They accorded with the High Court's approach in Royall v R. Causation was a question of fact to be determined by the jury on the evidence. 

78As discussed in Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1994) at 591 in the context of a murder charge, 'In law the foetus is treated as a part of the mother until it has a separate existence of its own. Thus to cause injury to the foetus is just as unlawful as any assault upon any other part of the mother.' Consistently with this approach, in s 52A of the Crimes Act a distinction has been drawn between an impact which results in the death of a foetus in utero, which, if the other elements of the offence are established, will result in an offence under s 52A(3); and an impact which results in a baby who is born alive, but who dies later as the result of the impact, which will result in a s 52A(1) offence. If the evidence establishes that the impact was a substantial cause of the death of the foetus after birth, the s 52A(1) offence will be established, whether the death is caused by pre-birth injury, or by the prematurity of the child at birth itself.

79It must not be overlooked that in the case of an impact which results in the death of a foetus in utero, it is a s 52A(3) offence in respect of the mother which will arise, if the other elements of the offence are present. That is an offence concerned with dangerous driving which results in grievous bodily harm. Importantly, the definition of 'grievous bodily harm' includes in paragraph (a) 'the destruction (other than in the course of a medical procedure) of the foetus of a pregnant woman, whether or not the woman suffers any other harm'.

80The appellant argued that in order for an offender to be convicted of an offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act, in circumstances where a child is born preterm but later dies, the evidence must establish that there was an actual injury to the foetus in utero, prior to its birth. Given the elements of the dangerous driving offences created by s 52A, this submission may not be accepted. 

81Contrary to the submissions advanced for the appellant, the elements of a s 52A(1) offence do not alter in a case where the death in question is that of a baby who is born alive after an impact. No matter the age of the victim, such an offence will be proven if the evidence establishes that:

1 a person drove a vehicle 

2 the vehicle was involved in an impact

3 the impact occasioned the death of another person 

4 the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:

(a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug, or
(b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons, or
(c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.


82As to the third element of a s 52A(1) offence, in the case of a child delivered alive after an impact, the evidence will establish that the impact caused its death, if it is shown beyond reasonable doubt:

firstly, that the child was in utero at the time of the impact; 

secondly, that as the result of the impact it was born alive; and 

thirdly, that its later death was the result of that impact. That is, that the impact was a substantial or significant cause of its death. 


83Such a substantial or significant cause of death may be shown in one of two ways, or by a combination of the two. The first is by evidence which establishes that the impact injured the foetus in such a way that those injuries were a substantial or significant cause of its death, after its birth. The second is by evidence which establishes that the impact caused the baby's birth preterm and that its prematurity at birth was a substantial or significant cause of its death, after birth.

84When the authorities on which the appellant relied are considered, it can be seen that they support this approach to the operation of s 52A. R v F (1996) 40 NSWLR 245; 89 A Crim R 250, was concerned with a particular question of law, namely:


""Is a child in utero who is injured through impact with a motor vehicle or through impact with any object of a motor vehicle in or on which that child in utero was being conveyed, is subsequently born, lives independently and then dies as a result of the injuries sustained, a person for the purposes of s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900?"" ""



85There it was concluded that a baby who is born alive, is a person within the meaning of s 52A. Grove J observed at 253, that subject to the condition of being born alive, a baby was capable of being the victim of homicide and at common law, a claimant for damages for injuries sustained in utero (see Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1994) at 589-90). In R v F, the baby had suffered injuries in utero as a result of the accident, had been born alive, but had later died of those injuries. That was not this case. Here, there was no injury in utero caused by the accident, rather, the impact caused Samavaya's extremely premature birth, at only 24 weeks gestation. That was at a time when his organs were not sufficiently developed to enable him to survive outside the womb, without successful medical intervention. 

86On the evidence, in the case of a pregnancy which would have continued to full-term, but for the impact, a premature birth may involve a very considerable injury to a foetus. Even if born alive, such a birth can itself involve an injury, just as serious as other injuries caused to a baby in utero by an impact, which may result in its death after birth. 

87In this case, consistently with common sense, the expert evidence was that a premature birth can make a baby vulnerable, not only to illness and injury, but also to death, given its immaturity at preterm birth. The extent of such a baby's vulnerability at birth depends on the degree of its prematurity and the extent to which its organs and systems have developed in utero prior to birth. Even nowadays, when sophisticated means of medical intervention may be available to support such infants after they are born, some premature babies are still incapable of living independently, given the time of their birth. In the case of extremely premature babies, such as those born at 24 weeks, even with such medical intervention and significant treatment when conditions which result from their prematurity develop, they succumb to the risk of death which their premature birth has subjected them to. 

88In terms of causation, it follows that even if premature birth is not itself considered to be an injury to a foetus, if the child is born alive as the result of the impact, but later dies because of the immaturity of its organs and systems at the birth which the impact caused, such a death may be treated as if it were the result of the impact. Such a child is capable of being the victim of a s 52A(1) offence. Evidence that the death was the result of the prematurity of the baby at the birth caused by the impact will establish that an offence under s 52A(1) was committed, if the other elements of the offence are proven. 

89As discussed in R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; (2003) 59 NSWLR 472, the offence created by s 52A does not contain intention as an element. It is concerned only with the question of whether a particular death was caused by an impact. In a case where the evidence establishes that rather than a particular injury to the foetus in utero, the impact caused a premature birth, which resulted in a baby who was born alive, but who later died as the result of the prematurity of the birth caused by the impact, the offence will be committed.

90This approach to s 52A(1) accords with the common law position on which the appellant relied, resting on the headnote in The Queen v West, referred to In Archbold, 43rd edition at 20-11, where it was said:
""... Thus, if a person, intending to procure abortion, does an act which causes a child to be born so much earlier than the natural time, that it is born in a state much less capable of living, and afterwards dies in consequence of its exposure to the external world; the person who, by this misconduct, so brings the child into the world; and puts it thereby in a situation in which it cannot live, is guilty of murder; and the mere existence of a possibility that something might have been done to prevent the death would not render it the less murder: R v West (1848) 2 C. & K. 784.""


91It was accepted that if the appellant's submissions on the law failed, on the evidence it was open to the jury to conclude that the s 52A(1)(c) offence had been proven. It is accordingly unnecessary to consider the evidence any further, other than to observe that it was the commonly held view of the experts that the accident caused the premature birth and that the baby's death was the result of it succumbing to NEC, because of the immaturity of its organs and systems on birth, at a time of extreme prematurity. While another cause of death could not be completely excluded, it was entirely unlikely. NEC is a life threatening condition to which extremely premature babies are vulnerable, because of the immaturity of their organs and immune systems at birth. In this case, because of his prematurity, Samanvaya died as the result of the sudden onset of a condition to which premature babies such as he are vulnerable, despite considerable medical endeavours to save his life. 

92On that evidence there could, in my view, be no question that the appellant was guilty of the offence of which he was convicted (see SKA v R [2011] HCA 13).

The sentence appeal

""1.UPON THE GROUND that the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.
2.Her Honour erred in determining the degree of moral culpability for this offence as being at a low level.""

93Again, both grounds of appeal may conveniently be dealt with together.

94The Crown accepted that this was a difficult sentencing task. It was not disputed that the appellant had not only expressed, but had shown genuine remorse by his actions and that he had a strong subjective case, even though his driving record was not good. The Crown's case was however, that a lenient sentence was not available, merely because of the presence of strong subjective factors and that on the objective facts, there was a need for general deterrence, given her Honour's error as to the appellant's moral culpability. Nevertheless, the Court's residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence, even if it was erroneously lenient, was acknowledged. 

95It was also accepted that to establish either ground, the Crown had to show that her Honour's findings were not open, or that error in the sense referred to in House v R was established (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321). This required the Crown to establish that there had been some misapplication of principle (see Hili v R [2010] HCA 45). In particular, it was submitted that her Honour had erred in imposing an intensive correction order, inconsistently with the approach to such orders discussed by Simpson J in R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17. 

96In my view, neither ground of this appeal was made out.

97Her Honour was obliged to come to a view as to the appellant's moral culpability. There was an issue between the parties as to that characterisation, which rested in part on a conflict in the evidence. That conflict was resolved by her Honour, who accepted the appellant's evidence as to how the accident had come to occur, namely that he had lawfully overtaken the first of the vehicles towing a boat that he encountered; that when he then attempted to return to his side of the road, he found that the gap between that vehicle and the one in front of it had closed; he then decided to overtake the second vehicle; that when he first noticed the oncoming vehicle, he did not have time to brake and fall behind the first vehicle; and that he then decided to steer onto the shoulder, on the right side of the road where the collision occurred.

98The appellant's evidence as to his unsuccessful attempt to regain his side of the road was supported in various respects by evidence given by Mr Kumar, Ms Kapur and Mr Piirlaid. His evidence as to the speed that the vehicle he was overtaking had been travelling, was supported by that given Mr Lucas Rosman. His evidence conflicted with that of Mr Piirlaid and Mr Lucas Rosman in other respects. 

99Her Honour was in the best position to come to a conclusion as to what findings should be reached on the conflicting evidence. She was clearly impressed by the evidence given by the appellant. He had not only made admissions in relation to dangerous driving, he had accepted that he had made a serious error of judgment in deciding to overtake as he did, and in cross examination, he also made various other concessions, although disagreeing with certain matters put to him, including in relation to the speed of the vehicles, the place of the collision, and the time and distance over which he was on the incorrect side of the road before the impact occurred. By way of contrast, her Honour was not at all satisfied with the evidence given by Mr Piirlaid. His evidence was inconsistent in certain relevant respects with the evidence of the appellant, Mr Kumar and Mr Lucas Rosman. Her Honour resolved the conflicts in evidence, as to how the collision occurred, in favour of the appellant, as she was entitled to do, in the circumstances.

100No error has been shown in the factual findings which her Honour made. The submission that her Honour ought to have accepted the Crown case as to the speed at which the appellant must have been driving, rested on certain mathematical calculations which had regard to measurements made by Senior Constable Jenkins. In my view that submission should not be accepted. The calculations rested not only on measurements which she had made and which the appellant accepted, but also on certain assumptions, including as to the place of the collision and the speed at which the vehicles were travelling, which he disputed and which her Honour concluded had not been established. The appellant's evidence was in part supported by other evidence. On that evidence her Honour was clearly entitled to come to the view which she reached, as to the case which the Crown had advanced.

101Nor does the evidence leave open the conclusion that her Honour's view, that the level of the appellant's moral culpability was low, was not one reasonably open. As the Crown accepted, this was a discretionary conclusion which her Honour reached, having in mind the factors discussed in the authorities which bound her. 

102The conclusion that the accident was the result of an error of judgment, in the course of a lawful attempt to overtake one vehicle towing a boat was clearly open. No error was shown in that regard. In reaching a conclusion as to the appellant's moral culpability, as the Crown submitted, her Honour also had to consider that this collision occurred early in the morning, in the dark, before a curve in the road. The appellant accepted that his decision to overtake the second vehicle, when he could not move back onto his side of the road, because the gap between the vehicles had closed, involved a serious error of judgment. 

103It must be accepted on the evidence that it was a decision made quickly. Also to be considered was that it had very serious consequences, namely a head-on collision, which the appellant and Mr Kumar both unsuccessfully sought to avoid, with the result not only serious injuries for the appellant and Ms Kapur, but the eventual premature birth and death of a baby, who otherwise would have lived to full term. 

104Her Honour did not overlook any of the relevant considerations. Her conclusion as to the appellant's moral culpability rested on the view to which she came as to what had contributed to the collision, as well as her consideration of the matters discussed in Jurisic and R v Whyte. No error was shown in her Honour's approach. It must be considered that in Whyte Spigelman CJ said at [228] - [230] that:

""228 In the above list of aggravating factors, items (iii)-(xi) are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion.

229 The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 

Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.

230 In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate.""


105The aggravating factors to which the Chief Justice referred, were factors directed to the two limbs identified in Jurisic. As to this the Chief Justice said:

""213 Since the decision of this Court in Jurisic the Parliament has enacted s5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides:

""5(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

(2) A court that sentences an offender to imprisonment for 6 months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, including its reasons for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.""

This statutory directive requires an amendment to the first limb of the Jurisic guideline.

214 The guideline this Court should give pursuant to s37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 with respect to the typical case identified above is: 

A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment.


The Numerical Guideline

215 The second limb of the guideline in Jurisic at 231 was as follows: 

""With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.""

216 I had earlier set out a list of aggravating factors which had been established in the authorities as follows:

""(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted.
(ii) Number of people put at risk.
(iii) Degree of speed.
(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse.
(v) Erratic driving.
(vi) Competitive driving or showing off.
(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk.
(viii) Ignoring of warnings.
(ix) Escaping police pursuit.""

217 Further consideration of the authorities would cause me to amend this list by changing (v) to read ""erratic or aggressive driving"" and adding: 

(x) Degree of sleep deprivation. 
(xi) Failing to stop. 

218 I went on to say at 231: 

""Paragraph (i) and par (ii) focus on the occurrence, whereas pars (iii)-(ix) refer to the conduct of the offender. The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence.""

219 It was after this passage that the two limbs of the guideline in Jurisic were set out.

220 I said at 231 that the formulation of whether ""the relevant aggravating factor manifest[s] in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct"" involves an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ.""


106On appeal the Crown relied on Latham J's discussion in Mitreski v R; R v Mitreski [2008] NSWCCA 301 at [53] - [54]:

""53 It is important to return to what was said by the Chief Justice in Jurisic in order to understand the ambit of ""momentary inattention"". The first reference to ""momentary inattention or misjudgement"" in Jurisic at 223 derives from R v Guilfoyle (1973) 57 Cr App R 549 at 552. There, the distinction was drawn between cases falling into two broad categories, namely, momentary inattention and ""those in which the accused has driven in a manner which has shown a selfish disregard for the safety of other road users.""

54 The Chief Justice in Jurisic also referred to R v Musumeci (unreported) NSWCCA 30 October 1997, which was ""in many respects .. a guideline judgment"". Following the introduction of s 52A, which almost tripled the maximum penalty formerly applying to this offence, Hunt CJ at CL in Musumeci summarised the considerations to be taken into account on sentence. In the course of that summary, his Honour said that where ""the offence is committed even though the offender has had no more than a momentary or casual lapse of attention, there must always be room for a non-custodial sentence,..... but the case in which a sentence other than one involving full-time custody is appropriate must be rarer for this new offence."" (bold not in original) 

55 Consistent with this formulation, the guideline promulgated by Jurisic characterised non-custodial sentences for an offence against s 52A as ""exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement"". Whilst the Chief Justice did not say ""no more than momentary inattention"", it is implicit, in my opinion, from the references to Guilfoyle and Musumeci. (See also R v Howland [1999] NSWCCA 10 at [39] ""mere momentary inattention"" ; R v Dunlop [2001] NSWCCA 435 at [42] ""more than momentary inattention"") Next, and most importantly, the guideline went on to state that ""with a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence of less than three years [in cases of death] ... should be exceptional.""


107In my view no error was shown in her Honour's conclusions about these matters. The evidence established that this was a serious misjudgement, putting a number of people at risk and resulting in a death. She also concluded that this had occurred in circumstances where it was not only the appellant who had contributed to what had occurred and that the circumstances were not such that the view could properly be taken that the appellant had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. Her Honour's view as to the absence of other aggravating fact was, in my view, also open.

108I am not persuaded that her Honour erred in the conclusions which she reached, having in mind what was discussed in DPP v Samadi [2006] NSWCCA 308 at [16] - [19]:
""16 The promulgation of the guideline was in the following terms, namely that where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full-time custodial head sentence of less than three years in the case of death would not generally be appropriate. However, in the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will be appropriate. It should also be noted that the guideline was predicated on a plea of guilty, so that the proposed sentencing range assumes a 10% discount of the sentences that might otherwise apply. 
17 Since Whyte, a number of decisions of this Court have explored the above formulation. In R v Errington [2005] NSWCCA 348, Mason P commented that :- 
There is a wide spectrum of behaviour indicative of differing levels of moral culpability, indeed differing degrees of abandonment [of responsibility]. It is not required that cases be assigned to one or other of two pigeon holes marked respectively ""momentary inattention or misjudgment"" and ""abandoned responsibility"". In R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32, Simpson J (dissenting) held (at [31]: 
Offences under s52A are not divided into those of momentary inattention and those of abandonment of responsibility. Those are the two extremes. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offence and it is proper for the courts to recognise a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, when assessing moral culpability.
Sully J (Carruthers AJ concurring) agreed with these remarks, while differing from her Honour in the disposition of the appeal. 
18 In R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186, Simpson and Howie JJ (at par 37) said:- 
It is clear that the Chief Justice in both Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and Whyte was not attempting to identify all the matters that might impact upon the assessment of the moral culpability of an offender in any particular case. For example, the type of vehicle being driven might be an aggravating factor that goes to the moral culpability or the abandonment of responsibility of the driver in a particular case.
19 To similar effect is the following passage from the judgment of Howie J in Gonzalez v R [2006] NSWCCA 4 (at par 13) :- 
There is a high degree of moral culpability displayed where there is present to a material degree one or more of the aggravating factors numbered (iii) to (ix) set out in Whyte. However, there may be other factors that reflect on the degree of moral culpability involved in a particular case and the factors identified in Whyte can vary in intensity: R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274 at [25]. The list of factors is illustrative only and not definitive: Errington at [36].""


109 It was also submitted for the Crown that there were marked disparities with the sentences imposed in other cases, where similar offences arose for consideration, such as Hedges v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 263, although it was acknowledged that there had been unsuccessful crown Appeals in R v Radley [2010] NSWCCA 64, where a periodic detention sentence had been imposed and R v Townsend [2010] NSWCCA 336, where a community service order had been imposed.

110As to the imposition of an intensive correctional order, the Crown relied on the observations of Simpson J in R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 at [110] - [111], a case concerning Commonwealth tax offences. Simpson J, with whom Hislop and Latham JJ agreed, discussed the purpose of intensive correction orders at [109]:

""109First, the use of Intensive Correction orders in these circumstances demonstrates a misconception of the nature of this, relatively new, form of punishment. Section 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act was inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Legislation) Amendment (Intensive Correction Orders) Act 2010, with effect from 1 October 2010. It is apparent that there has not been time for any significant judicial consideration of the circumstances in which its application is appropriate, certainly not at appellate level. However, it is clear that the principal focus of this sentencing option is rehabilitation. In the second reading speech the Attorney-General said: 
""The Bill introduces a new sentencing option - the intensive correction order - designed to reduce the offender's risk of re-offending through the provision of intensive rehabilitation and supervision in the community. 
It also abolishes the sentence of periodic detention, giving effect to recommendations from the NSW Sentencing Council and calls from the victims of crime representatives. 
Essentially, an intensive correction order is a sentence of imprisonment for up to 2 years which is ordered to be served in the community, where offenders can be subject to a range of stringent conditions including 24 hour monitoring, regular community work and a combination of tailored educational, rehabilitative and other related activities. 

... 

While it is not intended to be a direct replacement of periodic detention, the power of the courts to make a periodic detention order will cease upon the commencement of the new intensive correction order. 
... 
The restriction of the court setting a non-parole period for an ICO was an essential feature of the model recommended by the Sentencing Council, on the basis that the offender should be subject to supervision and conditions of the order for its full term. This would ensure that the rehabilitative focus of the order is maintained from beginning to end."" (Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), Legislative Council, 22 June 2010, P 24426 and following.)""


111In that case Simpson J was of the view that rehabilitation was an irrelevant consideration, there being no, or minimal, prospect of either of the respondents re-offending. In her Honour's view that rendered the use of the intensive correction order inappropriate, it being an order which should not be used as a substitute for the now unavailable option of periodic detention. In the circumstances, which concerned tax evasion, her Honour also took the view that such an order, which has inherent in it a high degree of leniency, was unwarranted. On the evidence and her Honour's findings, it is apparent that this was a different case.

112In this case her Honour was bound by s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides:

""5 Penalties of imprisonment

(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.""


113The possible alternatives available on sentencing, included that provided by s 7, which provides:

""7 Intensive correction orders

(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 2 years may make an intensive correction order directing that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community.

(2) If a court makes an intensive correction order directing that a sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, the court is not to set a non-parole period for the sentence.

(3) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 5.""


114An order under s 7 is not restricted to any particular class of offending. Her Honour was also obliged to observe the provisions of s 69 in Part 5 of he Act, which provides:

""69 Referral of offender for assessment

(1) Before imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community.

(2) A court is not to refer an offender for such an assessment unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years.""


115Her Honour made such a reference, having been addressed by the parties on the nature of the appellant's moral culpability and whether a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate. In that respect s 67 provides:
""67 Suitability of offender for intensive correction order
(1) An intensive correction order may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied:
(a) that the offender is of or above the age of 18 years, and
(b) that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, and
(c) that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, and
(d) that the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligations under the intensive correction order.
(2) In deciding whether or not to make an intensive correction order, the court is to have regard to:
(a) the contents of the assessment report on the offender (prepared under section 70), and
(b) such evidence from the Commissioner of Corrective Services as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order.
(3) A court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make an intensive correction order despite the contents of the assessment report.
(4) A court may make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment only if the assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community.
(5) If a court declines to make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment despite an assessment report that states that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, the court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so.
(6) A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with subsection (5).""


116The appellant was assessed to be suitable for an intensive correction order. The report was later tendered. In that respect s 70 provided:

""70 Assessment of suitability
(1) When an offender is referred for assessment, the Commissioner of Corrective Services is to investigate and report to the court on the matters referred to in section 67 (1) and such other matters as the regulations may require.
(2) An offender's assessment report:
(a) must take into account, and specifically address, the matters prescribed by the regulations, and
(b) may indicate the nature of any conditions that it would be appropriate for the court to impose on an intensive correction order if such an order is made.
(3) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the conduct of investigations and the preparation of reports for the purposes of this Part.""


117The report was governed by Regulation 14 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010, which provides:

""14 Assessment reports
(1) An offender's assessment report must take into account, and specifically address, the following matters:
(a) any criminal record of the offender, and the likelihood that the offender will re-offend,
(b) any risks associated with managing the offender in the community (taking into account the offender's response to supervision in the community on previous occasions),
(c) the likelihood that the offender will commit a domestic violence offence,
(d) whether the offender will have suitable residential accommodation for the duration of an intensive correction order,
(e) whether any circumstances of the offender's residence, employment, study or other activities would inhibit effective implementation of an intensive correction order,
(f) whether the persons with whom it is likely the offender would reside, or continue or resume a relationship, understand the requirements of an intensive correction order and are prepared to live in conformity with them, so far as may be necessary,
(g) whether the making of an intensive correction order would place at risk of harm any person who would be living with or in the vicinity of the offender,
(h) any dependency of the offender on alcohol or drugs, or other substance abuse, that would affect the offender's ability to comply with the offender's obligations under an intensive correction order,
(i) any physical or mental health conditions of the offender that would affect the offender's ability to comply with the offender's obligations under an intensive correction order,
(j) the existence and extent of any self-harm risk, including the likely impact of an intensive correction order on that risk, and the availability in the community of the support and treatment services necessary to manage the risk.
(2) If a child under the age of 18 years would be living with an offender serving a sentence of imprisonment by way of intensive correction, the assessment report must take into account, and specifically address, the effect on the child of that fact.
(3) If it appears to the officer preparing the assessment report that the offender is homeless:
(a) all reasonable efforts must be made by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, in consultation with the offender, to find suitable accommodation for the offender, and
(b) the report is not to be finalised until those efforts have been made.
(4) An offender's assessment report must also include an assessment of:
(a) factors associated with his or her offending that would be able to be addressed by targeted interventions under an intensive correction order, and
(b) the availability of resources to address those factors by targeted interventions under an intensive correction order, and
(c) any issues relevant to the administration of an intensive correction order in respect of the offender that may be relevant to the court's determination of an appropriate date to be fixed for the commencement of the sentence.""


118The report identified that the appellant had been assessed as suitable for an intensive correction order; that he had signed the necessary undertaking; and that the factors to be targeted if the order was made were a driving programme and a counselling programme. The parties then made further submissions as to the appropriate sentence, before her Honour sentenced the appellant. 

119In R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643 Buddin J also discussed intensive correction orders in the context of Commonwealth offences, there observing at [67] to [75]:

""67It is common ground that an ICO has been available as a sentencing option for Commonwealth offences since 29 October 2010: Crimes Amendment Regulations 2010 (Cth) (No.4). 

68To assist my understanding of the operation of such orders, the parties provided me with a considerable amount of background information. Material provided by Corrective Services NSW suggests that a curfew may be imposed upon the offender in addition to the other conditions to which I have referred. As I understand the situation, the ICO consists of 4 stages, commencing with the most restrictive conditions and progressively working towards fewer restrictions. 

69Because ICOs have been available in Victoria for some time, and particularly as there appears to be little difference between the two schemes, the parties drew my attention to some aspects of the scheme which operates in that State. Section 19 of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) enables a court, in the circumstances set out in ss (1), to impose a sentence of imprisonment of not more than one year and order that it be served by way of intensive correction in the community. Section 20(1) sets out the core conditions of an ICO and ss (2) provides that an ICO must have all the core conditions attached to it. 

70Core condition (d) requires that the offender attend at a specified community corrections centre, or as otherwise directed by a community corrections officer, for twelve hours during each week of the period of the order or a shorter period specified in the order for the purpose of - 

(i) performing unpaid community work as directed by the Regional Manager for not less than eight of those hours; and 

(ii) spending the balance (if any) of those hours undergoing counselling or treatment for a specified psychological, psychiatric, drug or alcohol problem as directed by the Regional Manager. 

71In DPP v Nikolic [2008] VSCA 226, Warren CJ, with whom Vincent JA agreed, said that 

[a]n intensive correction order is not a light sentence. It is intended to be, and ordinarily will be, burdensome and will substantially contribute to the punishment of an offender, including where condign punishment is warranted. [at para 21]. 

72In DPP v Karazisis & others [2010] VSCA 350, in the context of dismissing Crown appeals against the inadequacy of sentences in which ICOs had been imposed at first instance, a majority of the Court of Appeal in Victoria said: 

In any case, it is well established that an Intensive Correction Order must be regarded as a significantly punitive disposition. The conditions of any such order are extremely onerous. Any breach is likely to have dire consequences. [at para 184] 

73In R v Lanteri [2006] VSC 225, Gillard J said: 

An Intensive Correction Order seeks to meet the objects of sentencing. There is no doubt that it is a form of penalty in that it will intrude into your life for the next 12 months. It will require you to provide your services to the community on an unpaid basis, and further will constantly remind you over the next 12 months of the evils of criminal conduct. It will be an appropriate adjunct to your rehabilitation and a constant reminder to you to never again involve yourself in criminal conduct. [at para 116]. 

74In Aitken v Moten-Connor (Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported, 9 February 1995) Smith J said: 

It becomes necessary then to identify the important features of an Intensive Correction Order. It might be argued that major features of the Intensive Correction Order are the imposition of the term of imprisonment and the treating of the order as a sentence of imprisonment. From the legal point of view that is a very significant aspect of the order. Plainly, however, it is the requirement that the sentence of imprisonment be served by intensive correction that gives an Intensive Correction Order its identity. To remove the latter is to change the character of the Order so that it ceases to be an Intensive Correction Order. [at p 5] 

75In Dimitrovski v Jones (Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported 23 August 1994) Mandie J said: 

In his Second Reading Speech relating to the Sentencing Bill in the Legislative Assembly on 19 th March 1991, the then Attorney-General said this: ""The Bill introduces a new sanction - the intensive correction order. This measure is designed to provide a severe punishment just short of imprisonment but more severe than a community-based order."" [at p4]""


120It seems to me that the Crown's submission that an intensive correction order reflects a significant degree of leniency may be accepted, but that still it may not be overlooked that such an order involves a substantial punishment, properly available to be imposed in a case such as this, where her Honour came to the view that the appellant's offending was at the lower end of moral culpability. As discussed in the authorities, there will be cases where an error of judgment occurs in circumstances where the evidence establishes that an offender's moral culpability is low, even when a death has occurred. The authorities to which the Crown referred demonstrate that in some such cases, the imposition of a non-custodial sentence will not involve error. 

121In this case, having come to the view dealt with in s 69(2) of the Act, namely that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate and that the term of such a sentence was likely to be less than 2 years, her Honour referred the appellant for an assessment in relation to an intensive correction order. He was assessed to be suitable. Her Honour was thus obliged to give consideration to the factors specified in s 67. She was required to consider the assessment report and to consider whether the applicant was a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction order and whether in the circumstances, service of the sentence in the community by way of such an intensive correction order was appropriate. 

122I am not persuaded that her Honour erred in coming to the conclusion which she reached. Her Honour's view was that in circumstances where she had assessed the appellant's moral culpability to be low, it was appropriate for the appellant to serve his sentence by way of an intensive correction order, for which he had been assessed as being suitable, on terms which were crafted by her Honour not only to have regard to appropriate and stringent conditions in relation to, for example, supervision, surveillance and community service, but also as to participation in programmes designed to address his serious offending in relation to the operation of motor vehicles. It seems to me that view was well open to her Honour as a matter of discretion, in the circumstances of this offender.

123It follows that this appeal must also be dismissed.

Order

124I would order:

1.That the conviction appeal be dismissed.
2.That the sentence appeal be dismissed.

		04 July 2012",2012-07-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708005,R v Blake Geoffrey ELLIS [2012] NSWDC 170,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Blake Geoffrey Ellis appears today for sentence in relation to an offence alleging that he, between 24 November 2010 and 15 December 2010 at Werris Creek in the state of New South Wales did manufacture an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 19.275 kilograms of 3,4methylenedioxyamphetamine, otherwise known as MDA, which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. The standard nonparole period for this offence is fifteen years imprisonment. A large commercial quantity of the drug MDA is a quantity not less than 500 grams. The prisoner has been in custody, as I understand it, since 10 May 2011 and any sentence to be imposed will date from that date. 

2In this matter the Crown tendered a fourteenpage statement of facts which was not an ""agreed statement of facts"", in that it was signed by the prisoner and/or his legal representative. However, the Crown submitted, without specific dispute from learned counsel for the accused, save for matters I will deal with in my judgment, that essentially the facts to a large extent were not in dispute. The matters the Crown submitted were in dispute, however, were:

(i) the offender's involvement in the actual process of manufacture that commenced after 24 November 2010 and had finished by 15 December 2010;

(ii) the offender's role in the joint enterprise to manufacture MDA; and

(iii) the amount of time the prisoner was present at the Werris Creek property between 23 November and 16 December 2010. That is, the date that was typed in the facts, but in fact the dates are not exactly accurate in that respect. 

3As can be seen from the facts presented and the facts as I find them, the three matters identified very much overlap and are intimately bound together. 

4The statement of facts that was tendered, however, transpired to be somewhat misleading. For instance, it was found to be materially incorrect in particular respects and required amendment during the course of the proceedings. It was difficult to work out where some of the information within the statement of facts had come from. It would appear that it was based upon a range of sources, a number of which are not identified. Only in the course of discussing the matter with the parties, particularly the Crown, was it revealed to the Court clearly that part of the material was based upon information provided by AD, the person who has provided information to the authorities as an associate of the person described as ""the financier"" referred to in the facts as SY. Some of the representations within the facts were based upon surveillance material, some were from police investigations and observations, some were from phone records, statements and other sources. 

5The learned solicitor for the prisoner gave an indication that the critical issue for determination was the role of the prisoner in the context of an admission of involvement in the joint criminal enterprise. In order to assist the Court in relation to the fact finding, particularly in relation to the matters identified specifically by the Crown, the prisoner commenced to give evidence in relation to the matter. However, within a very short period of time he indicated that he would not answer questions which identified particular people with whom he was associated. This situation was somewhat absurd, given that the particular people in question were already identified in the facts.

6Perhaps the prisoner feared that by giving evidence about matters referred to in the facts, he might provide material that may be used in proceedings in relation to the co-accused. There are a number of people referred to in the statement of facts who are still to be dealt with by the Courts in one way or another.

7He also said, in circumstances where I was on the verge of directing him to answer questions, that he had fears for his safety. The reason for this was not made clear to me, save for the fact that, no doubt in associating with others in this joint criminal enterprise, he was associating with a number of unsavoury, perhaps dangerous, people. The extent of their danger to him was not made known to me by any evidence. 

8A cynical response to the prisoner's plight, simply to state the obvious, was that in choosing to associate with the people that he associated with up until the time of the commission of this offence, he ought to have been more discerning. 

9I am mindful of the fact that in January 2012 whilst he was in custody, an unknown person caused damage to a motor vehicle belonging to one of his parents. In the information contained within police documentation the damage was valued at $4,000. This matter was reported to the police, as was the fact that two days later a piece of paper was found in the letter box of the home of the parents of the prisoner upon which was written, ""If B talks your(sic) next bitch"". The note was produced to the Court as an exhibit. The author of the note of course is unknown. There is the suspicion by the prisoner's parents that it is related to the accused's co-accused, and the likelihood is that it has some connection with people that are awaiting appearance in Court.

10Although acknowledging there are difficulties for the prisoner in giving evidence, it must be said that it was totally unrealistic to call the prisoner to give evidence that would have been relied upon to establish facts in the case, when the witness, either on advice or of his own motion, was not prepared to give full particulars to enable his version of events to be either challenged, verified or even properly understood. In any event, the choice by him not to continue his evidence - he was granted leave to have his evidence withdrawn the following day - was his, taken on the advice of his counsel. It should be noted that I indicated to his counsel that, short of directing the prisoner to answer the questions, there were various other alternatives. I can compel the witness to answer questions. Or I could close the Court, or I could direct no publication of the evidence, or any one of those combinations.

11I appreciate that his unwillingness to continue with his evidence was no sign of disrespect for the Court. On the other hand, I do not understand why the way in which the sentence proceedings of his coaccused were conducted could in any way inform the manner in which this prisoner would be allowed to give evidence in these proceedings. That MH could give evidence without disclosing any relevant details or any particular details is a matter for that sentencing judge, not a matter that assist me in any way in conducting these current proceedings. I was not given the benefit of a transcript of what occurred in the sentencing of MH, to whom I will refer shortly. In any event, ultimately, I draw no inference adverse to the prisoner by his failure to complete his evidence.

12The essence of the charge to which the prisoner pleaded guilty arises from the fact that at 2pm on 15 December 2010 a white Hiace van that had been rented was stopped at Quirindi by a Highway Patrol officer and the driver submitted to a random breath test. In the vehicle were two men, MH who had been sentenced by her Honour Judge Payne on 27 January 2012 and AM. The police officer was told by the occupants of the Hiace van that they had come from Werris Creek. Their conduct raised the officer's suspicions. The occupants of the motor vehicle made admissions that they had been at a property near Werris Creek for approximately three weeks, the van had been rented for $500 a week. 

13A subsequent search of the van revealed glassware, including a condenser tube and a reaction flask, clearly associated with the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The two men were arrested, as I understand it, in relation to their possession of implements that may be used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs, and were subsequently taken to the police station at Tamworth. Investigations continued. They apparently were released on bail to be arrested a short time later when other finds were made in the van.

14The statement of facts sets out the detail of the search of the vehicle, which need not be dilated upon, beyond noting a range of glassware was found, as well as other items consistent with the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The glassware was subsequently tested and proved positive to the prohibited drug, which might shortly be called MDP2P, and other substances. A number of the substances that were identified in the glassware, or traces of which were found in the glassware, were precursors in the manufacture of the prohibited drug which the prisoner has been charged with, that is, manufacturing MDA. 

15In addition to precursors for the manufacture of MDMA, which is otherwise known as 'ecstasy', a mobile phone and a Blackberry phone were found. Ultimately, the police found sixteen vacuum-sealed plastic bags containing beigecoloured powder in each. The powder contained within it, on analysis, the prohibited drug MDA, and the net weight of the powder was 19.275 kilograms. 

16I have the analyst's certificate and a schedule of the purity of the various bags of the prohibited drug. The average estimated purity ranged between 8.8 and 10.3 per cent, generally in the low nine per cent range, and the table presented by the Crown shows the presence in the powder of other substances which might be described as cutting agents, such as caffeine and lactose. The presentation of the powder indicated that it was ready for pressing as pills. 

17The drugs, as it transpired, but unknown to the police at that stage, had been manufactured at a property situated at Lot 1, 410 Perlwar(?) Road near Werris Creek in what were described in the facts and the photographs as shearing quarters. I have evidence that the wholesale value of the prohibited drug seized, if each pill manufactured weighed an average of 0.31 grams at ten dollars per pill, was $621,690. At ten dollars per pill, with each pill weighing 0.37 grams, the wholesale value was $520,880. This would seem to be the amount of the wholesale value of the drugs settled upon by her Honour Judge Payne.

18MH and AM were, as I said initially, released on bail. MH, as I understood it, was arrested at the airport about to fly home, he believed, at that time. AM was arrested a short time later. Their arrests followed upon the finding of the prohibited drugs which, as I said, occurred apparently after they were granted bail.

19Subsequent to the van being stopped, the prisoner and a person called AF, who is alleged to be a principal in the manufacture of the prohibited drug, met up with SY and AD at the Ibis Hotel in Darling Harbour, having returned from Werris Creek to Sydney during the period of time that AM and MH were dealing with the police. The evidence reveals that AF, AM, the prisoner and MH were residents of the Cronulla/Sutherland area and had known each other for a number of years before the commission of this offence. AD states that the accused and AF were agitated on meeting with SY. AF and the prisoner requested money, according to the informer, to depart from Australia. The following day AF and the prisoner were observed by members of the Crime Commission, who had installed covert cameras and listening devices at a property at Elizabeth Bay associated with SY.

20The facts state, based upon the information provided by AD, that AF and the prisoner were given money by SY. AF and the prisoner travelled to the airport, it would seem directly, bought open tickets to Hong Kong, paying in cash, and immediately departed for Hong Kong without any luggage, obviously to avoid apprehension. In fact, they ultimately ended up in Bangkok, Thailand. The offender returned to Australia of his own volition on 18 January 2011, and I will deal with that aspect of the matter, which nobody placed much emphasis on in submissions, later in my findings of fact. He was not arrested until 10 May 2011. AF was the subject of an arrest warrant issued on 5 April 2011 and was arrested on a warrant in June 2011, to be ultimately extradited back to Australia in August 2011. I note that the prisoner is not alleged to be involved in any criminal conduct on his return.

21On the evidence available to this Court, the earliest contact between the prisoner and SY was when he attended a meeting in company with AF, also attended by AD, in the eastern suburbs. AD was not present when there were conversations that occurred between SY, AF and the prisoner. This meeting was on 31 October 2010. From evidence obtained from a receipt from Bunnings at Caringbah, recovered by police in their investigations, the prisoner and another person, initially, I hasten to say, identified as MH, but because of the findings of fact by Judge Payne, now a person unknown, attended upon Bunnings and purchased various goods in the sum of $1,663.36, out of a sum of $1,700 in cash proffered by the purchasers. The various items that were purchased were associated in various ways with the subsequent manufacture of MDA or other prohibited drugs, or were capable of being so used.

22On or about 2 November 2010, the prisoner and another person attended upon Burson Auto Parts in Cawarra Road, Caringbah, and ordered amounts of hosing, which apparently were collected the following day or the day after. From what I can work out, the prisoner paid $133 of the $400-odd dollars cost by an EFTPOS transaction. A police investigation which ran parallel with the impending manufacture of MDA at Werris Creek, which commenced in November 2010 from information from a member of the public, led to the search of the property at Coolumburra near Nowra on or about 22 November 2010. That search revealed various items associated with the clandestine laboratory, although no laboratory had been set up at that point. Amongst the items found was some of the hosing that had been purchased from Burson Auto parts by the prisoner in early November. As I understand the evidence, there is no evidence of any physical connection, other than the hosing, by the prisoner with that property.

23On 21 November 2010, two people, AD and RG, left a business called Lab Supply with glassware and other equipment that had been ordered by others for the manufacture of prohibited drugs. This was taken to a cul de sac in the suburb of Yowie Bay, which is in the Cronulla/Sutherland area, close to the home of AF, formerly the home of his father. The prisoner, AM and AF met the delivery and the glassware was transferred into a plain white van consistent with one of the white vans seen at the Werris Creek property where the manufacture of MDA subsequently took place. 

24Police investigations revealed that a man called GR lived at, or had control of, the property at Werris Creek, earlier mentioned. GR had an association with a person called EB up until 24 November 2010. On that date, EB met with GR and EB told GR that there were, ""three vans on the way up to Sydney"" and the occupants wished to use a shed on GR's property, on GR receiving a payment of $50,000. Not surprisingly, GR found the offer ""too good to refuse"". 

25After a meeting between GR and EB at a hotel in Werris Creek, GR met up with the vans near the town and guided MH, AF, the prisoner, as well as other males including, it is believed, AM to the property. The prisoner, AF, MH and AM unpacked the vans of the equipment which was placed in the shearers' quarters and ultimately set up to comprise a laboratory. Obviously chemicals and other substances were brought to the property to be used in the manufacture of the prohibited drug.

26EB returned to Sydney the following day, 25 November. After the unloading of the various vans, one van left and at least one van remained, as did the prisoner, AF and MH at least. The evidence reveals that the prisoner returned to Sydney by plane on the 3rd and returned to Tamworth on 4 December. He was seen at the Werris Creek property on 14 December 2010 when he spoke to GR and asked GR to provide a phone number so GR could be contacted to receive his payment. This conversation in fact took place in the early hours of 15 December 2010. On that date, GR saw two white vans and another van he described as an electrician's van, with letters on the roof. This van is said to be the prisoner's father's van, the prisoner's father being an electrical contractor. There is no dispute, as I understand it, that the prisoner's father owned a van of a similar description at that time.

27On 15 December 2010 the prisoner, AF, MH and AM packed the manufactured prohibited drug seized by the police in one of the vans and the various chemicals and equipment into each of the van that were available and ultimately left the property. I note the van of the prisoner's father was debited at 4.30am on an E-tag travelling on the eastern distributor on a northbound motorway on 15 December. Later, at 7.07pm, it was debited travelling across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on the southbound road. This is consistent with the van being driven north on 15 December from Sydney and returning that evening from Werris Creek. It is possible that the prisoner was the person driving the van north, likely one would have thought given that the van belonged to his father, and is consistent with the prisoner not necessarily having been at the property at Werris Creek continuously from 4 December until the laboratory was packed up.

28As it turned out, GR received no money for permitting his property to be used. He received an electricity bill for $800 for the period of the manufacture which was triple the normal usage rate. When he inspected the quarters he smelled a smell consistent with the use of chemicals that lingered for months, as well as other indicia of the manufacture of prohibited drugs, including various stains on the floor and on the walls.

29The white Hiace van intercepted by the highway patrol at Quirindi, when examined by police subsequently, rendered fingerprints of the offender, MH and AF on flasks and other equipment used for the manufacture of MDA. DNA testing of the sixteen bags for the prohibited drug was unsuccessful in matching any DNA profiles with the prisoner. Experts formed the view that some of the glassware and equipment located in the van was used in the preparation of the 19.275 kilograms of MDA that was found.

30One of the vans was rented from the Hertz organisation at Arncliffe on 17 November 2010. A person by the name of Thomas Rose was used to hire the motor vehicle. He declined to cooperate with police and now lives in England. AM rented a Hiace van on 24 November 2010, which vehicle was returned to the rental company the following day. The mileage on the vehicle returned was consistent with a round trip from Sydney to Werris Creek. 

31Another white van was rented by a ""dummy"", as I would understand it, on 18 November 2010 and returned on 17 December 2010. It had travelled 2,423 kilometres. The renter, a man called Andrew Truscott, left Australia afterwards for Dubai. He has not returned as I understand the position.

32A search of the property where the laboratory was set up was conducted on 22 March 2011 with the execution of a search warrant. Fingerprints identification was made of AF, MH and the prisoner on a toaster, the DNA of the prisoner and others was found on separate cigarette butts throughout the shearing quarters, the cigarette butt with the accused's DNA profile was found in a room where the manufacturing process took place. Other DNA evidence linking the prisoner to the property was located. The prohibited drug MDA was found on the walls of the quarters and on items that were used in the manufacture of MDA that were left in the premises.

33I should point out that, as I understand it, MDA is a prohibited drug which is sometimes passed off as MDMA or ecstasy. It has a very similar chemical constituency to ecstasy without the methyl component (as in methylamphetamine). From information made available to the Court, out of various quantities of MDMA or thought to be so by a purchase, approximately 1.4% of submitted samples are in fact MDA. GR does not assert that he saw the prisoner AF or MH every day. As I said, in relation to the prisoner's presence on the property, apart from his travel back and forth to Tamworth on 3 and 4 December, the major evidence concerning his movements is evidence that his mobile phone was effectively off the system, not operating or turned off between approximately 24 November and 3 December and between 4 December and the time that the parties left the Werris Creek property in mid December.

34Noting all that has been put and noting the difficulty in ascertaining the course of what is claimed to be the evidence within the statement of facts, the prosecution has clearly established that the prisoner was part of a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The earliest involvement of the prisoner would appear to stem from his meeting with SY in company with AF on 31 October 2010. His first active involvement was the purchase of items from Bunnings on 1 November 2010 in company with another person. The process of manufacture was clearly conducted between approximately 24 November and 15 December. The prisoner was obviously present at various times through that period of time, although it cannot be established that he was there the entire period of time. Certainly he was not there between 3 and 4 December. He may well have returned to Sydney from time-to-time by road transport before 15 December, particularly in order to drive his father's van back to Werris Creek. Apparently, it would seem, because the group needed three vans to pack up.

35I am informed in the fact there were more than seven people involved in the relevant joint criminal enterprise. The prisoner's presence at the delivery of the glassware, the delivery of items to Werris Creek, the packing up of Werris Creek, being within the place of manufacture, his discussion with Reynolds about obtaining a contact number, amongst other matters, show that he clearly knew of the process of manufacture taking place. He knew or would have understood what the product of the process was, or the processes of manufacture were that occurred over the period of time that the clandestine laboratory was set up. He was present for a number of days to contribute to the process of manufacture, either by directly involving himself in that process of manufacture or assisting those he did. 

36His asthma, which is well documented, may have inhibited him in his presence within the laboratory when particular chemicals were being used. Some chemicals used in the process - as I learned from a trial I have just concluded which was exclusively about the manufacture of methylamphetamine - can create a sensation similar to the effect of ammonia. But, on the other hand, there were respirators present to assist with breathing. Anybody, even somebody without asthma, would have had difficulty breathing from time-to-time throughout the process, and the processes involved in the manufacture of MDA, like methylamphetamine, take a number of stages which do not necessarily all involve difficulties with breathing.

37He had assisted in the packing up of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug manufactured, the glassware, the related chemicals and other equipment. The Crown has submitted that the prisoner was a principal in the enterprise, asserting that the prisoner was an important member of the enterprise and was a person who could be described as ""upper management"", having a more significant role than that of MH and not less than AF. In support of these submissions, the Crown points to these matters.

(i)The prisoner's involvement in purchasing items at Bunnings.

(ii)The purchase of the heater hoses.

(iii)The transportation of equipment to Werris Creek.

(iv)Unloading the equipment and setting it up, albeit that his exact role at the Werris Creek property is not clear but he was certainly present as part of the joint criminal enterprise.

(v)Although he left the property he returned.

(vi)He packed up the equipment and was involved in transporting equipment and unused items from the Werris Creek site.

(vii)He expected financial benefit.

(viii)He was involved at a ""early stage"" having regard to the chronology of the purchase of relevant items as can be ascertained by the prosecution.

(ix)He had direct contact with the principal of the operation, SY, who as I said, was described as the financier.

(x)He received money from SY to leave the country.

(xi)The prisoner discussed with GR, matters concerning a contact number to arrange payment for Reynolds.

38On the other hand it should be pointed out these matters are reflected in the evidence:

(i)There is no evidence that the prisoner financed any aspect of the operation, except for paying or being present, when the payment was made of $1700 at Bunnings, for the purchase of the hoses and contributing a modest amount in that regard.

(ii)There is no evidence the prisoner had any financial resources to properly finance any aspect of the operation. The evidence unchallenged is that at the time that he was seeking to flee the country, he borrowed nearly $3000 from his sister before he went overseas. No banking records have been produced to show that he had any substantial assets at that particular time.

(iii)There is no evidence that the prisoner was involved in hiring vans, choosing the location for manufacture or financing the purchase of equipment such as glassware, chemicals or paying rent for any particular location.

(iv)There is no evidence that the prisoner had any chemical or drug manufacturing skills, any past involvement in the manufacture of prohibited drugs, or any specialist knowledge in relation to the manufacture and distribution of prohibited drugs, in fact, apart from some cannabis use. There is no history of significant drug use on his part at all, according to the histories he has given others. 

(v)The Crown's facts and considerable detail reflect upon the information provided AD, the close associate of SY, and they reveal that the prisoner was not known to AD until the prisoner met with SY in company with AF. He had little to do with AD and SY, save for what I have outlined.

(vi)AD does not provide any information of first hand knowledge of the prisoner's involvement in any arrangements or preparations, relating to the matter beyond his observations of meetings with the prisoner. Whilst AD met the prisoner when equipment was delivered on or about 21 November, it is to be noted that AD had meetings with others, including AM, to provide him with equipment when the prisoner was not present. 

39Evidence was given by a police officer that SY was the financier of the criminal enterprise and that AF held a senior position. There were opinions expressed by the officer in charge of the matter, but I was not taken to any particular evidence to support of the analysis he gave. More importantly for my purposes, the prisoner was described as a ""long time"" associate of AF and was either at the same level or a little lower in the order of seniority of the enterprise. I asked the officer if in fact he had a signed organisation chart from SY, AF and/or the prisoner and he replied, that he did not. No such organisation in fact, was relevantly identified in any meaningful way, beyond as I have outlined it. I note in relation to the evidence that officer gave, that it was not alleged that the prisoner had access to or used one of the alleged encrypted Blackberries, that were used by members of the enterprise. As I understand it, there are no relevant intercepted telephone calls suggesting any particular relationship with the prisoner with any other members of the enterprise relevant to the furtherance of the criminal enterprise.

40I also note notwithstanding Judge Payne's findings regarding the role of MH, that MH and AM were entrusted with the transport of the manufactured drug. This was not the subject of any particular submission by either the Crown or the defence. I note that neither man co-operated with the initial police investigation and that is revealed by the fact that the prohibited drug was not found until after they were granted bail, having to be arrested a short time later. 

41If I may turn to the sentencing of MH and the relevance of its outcome to the sentencing here, as I said, MH was sentenced by her Honour Judge Payne on 27 January 2012. Her Honour's analysis of the evidence does not provide a great deal of detail, although she gives her reasons for concluding as she has, the role of MH and the objective seriousness of his criminality. This is not a criticism. But is relevant to the regard I should give to her findings for current purposes. It is to be noted that MH pleaded guilty to the same charge to which this prisoner has pleaded guilty. The learned trial judge imposed a sentence comprising a non parole period of six years, with a balance of sentence of three years and four months, making a total of nine year's and four month's imprisonment. There was a finding of special circumstances as is self evident. MH was given a discount of fifteen per cent, to represent the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. The plea was entered on 10 December 2011 as I understand it, prior to trial but the intention to plead having been communicated in late October. It should be noted the trial of that prisoner was first listed in the Tamworth District Court on 24 October 2011, and for various reasons transferred to Sydney. There was no committal proceedings. There was a waiver of committal. In relation to MH there was a finding that the prisoner had taken responsibility for his offending behaviour and otherwise demonstrated his contrition, as required pursuant to s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

42So far as his role in the criminal enterprise like the current prisoner, he had an association with a number of the co-offenders through the Cronulla area. He was sentenced as being part of a joint criminal enterprise. In his case there was no evidence linking him to: 

(i)the purchase of the chemicals used in the manufacture of the prohibited drugs 

(ii)the purchase of the glassware used for the Werris Creek manufacture 

(iii)the finding of the joint criminal enterprise 

(iv)the renting of the vehicles 

(v)nor any involvement with the affair at Nowra. 

43There is no evidence that showed that he had been involved in the selection of the Werris Creek property. 

44All of these observations could equally be made of the prisoner. As I said the prisoner did buy the hosing from Bursons and the items from Bunnings. Those items I point out included respirators, masking tape, various tools, petrol cans and other items including clothes pegs, related to the manufacture or supporting the presence of people at the shearer's quarters for the purposes of the manufacture of MDA. MH was sentenced on the basis of his involvement in taking items to Werris Creek, setting up the laboratory, remaining on the property during the course of the manufacturing process, building benches in the shearer's quarters so the glassware could be assembled upon it, purchasing food, beverages and fuel when necessary. Such details are not available for positive conclusion in relation to the prisoner appearing today. It was also pointed out by her Honour that MH was involved in the disassembly of the laboratory and the clearing, with AM, of the premises. As I have pointed out, he was entrusted with the custody of the product of the manufacturing process. 

45The learned sentencing judge accepted that MH was invited to participate in the joint criminal enterprise on Monday 23 November. This was not what was first asserted before me until the facts were amended. He was given little time to consider whether or not to participate. He was at the property working in the role that was described, between 24 and 29 November. He flew back to Sydney on 20 November to attend a probation and parole officer's appointment, returning on 1 December 2010, and remained at the Werris Creek property between 2 and 5 December inclusive. He drove back to Sydney in one of the vans, came back to Werris Creek on 15 December. She calculated the prisoner had been on the property nine and a half days and the prisoner was to receive a trip to Bali for his efforts, to the value of $4,000 to $5,000. 

46It was accepted that he performed fairly menial tasks. He was a ""step and fetch support service"". His participation was spontaneous. He had a low level of involvement. He was to receive little by reward, and had little time to consider participation. It might be added, as her Honour must have found, that he did participate, not over a matter of hours but over a matter of weeks. She concluded that the offence fell in the middle range but in the lower end of that range. His role was ""not insignificant"", nor was it fleeting or over a very short period, and he was a, ""trusted and important assistant to the principals, particularly so during the critical stage of manufacture"". He clearly had a ""very good idea"" of what was going on. 

47I note MH was two year's older than the prisoner. He was first convicted in 2001 for driving with high range PCA. He had convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assaulting police officers, damage to property and stealing property in a dwelling by 2004. In 2005 he was convicted of failing or refusing to undergo a breath analysis. In 2006 he was convicted of offensive manner and common assault. In 2008 he was convicted of destroying or damaging property for which he was fined and for behaving in an offensive manner as well as assaulting a police officer in the execution of this duty. For that last offence he received a good behaviour bond for a period of two years, on and from 15 October 2009. He was in breach of that bond when he committed the offence with which I am concerned. 

48In October 2010 he also received a bond for eighteen months to be of good behaviour for destroying or damaging property. He was also in breach of that bond at the commission of the subject offence. When sentenced he had a matter taken into account, on a Form 1 relating to the possession of the glassware but that was a matter of no moment, because it was inadvertently bound up with the facts relating to the principal offence. Of course, the sentencing of MH the only person thus far sentenced as far as I am aware, is highly relevant to the sentencing of this offender. The two men were convicted of the same offence, and were involved in the same criminal enterprise. Determining their respective roles as best one can from the available evidence, is one aspect of the extent to which there should be parity or disparity in their sentencing. 

49Noting differences in discounts to be applied, bearing in mind, as I will point out later, the prisoner receives a discount of twentyfive per cent. In noting the differences in subjective circumstances, is another matter to be taken into account. Equal justice requires like to be treated alike and the appropriate distinction drawn to the extent of the ""unalikeness"" of the offenders, their offending and their backgrounds. Equal justice is the fundamental principle from which party derives (see Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295, particularly, at 301-302 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ). As to the treatment of co-offenders and making due allowance for their ""un-alikeness"", see the discussion on ""equal justice"" by Justice Rothman in R v Jimmy (2010) 77 NSWLR 540, particularly at 597-598. 

50This matter, of course, does not give rise to consideration of significant and fundamental differences that arise for example, where cooffenders are convicted of different charges, discussed in Jimmy. Nor here are the issues that arise the same as those considered in Green v R (2001) 86 ALJR 36. Disparity between offenders may be justified by differences between co-offenders as to their role and culpability and as well, as to other matters such as differences in age, background, criminal history, general character and relevant mitigating and aggravating factors that arise under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

51I also note Green in relation to the issue of the notion of equal justice and its role in the sentencing of co-offenders. I note particularly the observations of Dawson J in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606, and Mason J in Lowe v R, (at 610). 

52Justice Mason said:

""The notion of equal justice is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice. Inconsistency in punishment because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence and the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for this reason that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community.""

53If I can turn to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner for the moment. He was born in August 1985. I note he was almost two years younger than MH. He has a number of convictions in the Local Court for crimes of violence including a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was fined $1,000 and placed on a good behaviour bond for twelve months in 2006. This in fact was his first major conviction. He breached that bond and the bond was replaced by a hundred hours community service. He was convicted of behaving in an offensive for which he was ordered to perform more community service. At the time of the breach of the bond in March 2007, he was convicted of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty on 22 June 2007 and fined $750 and ordered to pay court costs. 

54On 1 July 2010 he was convicted of ""affray"" for which he was fined $600 and ordered to pay court costs. That matter seems to arise out of what was claimed to be an attempt to defend a friend. For a conviction for common assault dealt with at the same time as the breach of the bond for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm matter, in early 2007, he was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended pursuant to s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and placed on supervision. 

55He has also been convicted of driving whilst suspended for which he was fined and disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver's licence for twelve months. He has no convictions for drug supply nor use. He was not subject to any form of conditional liberty at the time of the offence. He did manage to perform the requirements of the suspended sentence. I have a reasonably detailed Probation and Parole Service report. It relevantly notes the background of supervision. It states in relation to the period of supervision, which in fairness did occur some five years ago, when the prisoner would have been approximately twenty-two:

""During this supervision period, Mr Ellis' attempts to address his offending behaviour was short lived as he failed to attend the recommended ongoing psychological counselling, although his supervision was terminated early on 31 October 2007, Mr Ellis struggled to complete his CSO hours until March 2008.""

56The report sets out his background. The prisoner is the second of three children. He is said to have had a happy childhood. His father advised that Mr Ellis and his siblings upbringing was subject to ongoing parental conflict in relation this mother's health issues. Although there was no domestic violence and the parents remained married the supposed conflict between them was most severe when Mr Ellis was aged between eleven and fifteen years.

57During his teenage years and his early twenties he experienced behavioural problems associated with anger and aggression as his record makes clear. His mother declined to discuss the prisoner with the Service. His father stated that the extent of Mr Ellis' poor impulse control, poor decision and his inability to consider the consequences of his actions have been the contributing factors in his belief to the prisoner's offending behaviour. 

58He is supported by his family, but a relationship he had a with woman prior to coming into custody has not survived his incarceration. He was an unspectacular student at school. He left school at sixteen years of age, but he completed an apprenticeship as either an electrician or an electrical mechanic in his father's business. He continued in his employment with his father until May 2010. According the Probation and Parole Service references made in that report to his father's financial circumstances which I will deal with in a moment.

59The report notes as other documents available to the Court show that the prisoner was an Australian champion in various extreme sports and games and represented Australia in 1999 and 2000 particularly in the area of skateboarding. Being a champion athlete, in particular so many years before the commission of this offence, is little mitigation. There is reference in this report to a background of anxiety and ""depression"" and the provision of medication for that condition. There was recommendation by a psychologist back in 2007 for the prisoner to address his anger management issues. It is clear that he did not take any advice from the psychologist, preferring to hang around with people that clearly were of criminal propensity. Whether the prisoner was being hired as a bodyguard, or not, it is impossible to conclude. He certainly showed little interest in addressing the issues that brought him to Court in 2007.

60The prisoner admitted to social use of cannabis and claims that this is where he came to know his co-offenders. He told the Probation and Parole Service that his behaviour was ""motivated by stresses and worries associated with the financial problems of his father's business that had affected the whole family"". He claimed that these stresses contributed to poor decision making to obtain financial proceeds from drug manufacturing. The prisoner according to the Probation and Parole Service did not try to minimise his offence, although he did not agree with the ""police facts in entirety"". In fairness to the prisoner I have got absolutely no idea what piece of paper with writing on it was given to him to consider as being the supposed facts in relation to this matter and whether the facts that were provided to the Probation and Parole Service were in fact the same facts presented in this Court. 

61The prisoner said that he did not think of the consequences during his involvement in this crime. He was looking for an ""easy fix"". He has had no behavioural issues in custody. He has undertaken various programs to deal with sleep difficulties and is employed as a sweeper. He was cooperative with the Probation and Parole Service. The Probation and Parole Service stated:

""As reflected in his criminal history making poor decisions and taking inappropriate risks that have resulted in his offending behaviours would indicate that Mr Ellis appears to lack cognitive ability to consider consequences for his actions. Mr Ellis acknowledged that he lacks foresight and the ability to cope with challenging or stressful situations. Given this M Ellis may benefit from having a comprehensive psychiatric or psychological assessment with cognitive behavioural therapy and further intervention by this service to address his cannabis use and offending behaviour.""

62He is thought to require a medium level of intervention by the service.

63There was some medical evidence, which was very thin indeed. Discharge summaries were tendered from Sutherland Hospital which do confirm that the prisoner has suffered from asthma for a number of years, including an admission to an emergency ward at the Sutherland Hospital in May 2006 for a severe asthma attack. He has been treated in the past for a head injury that came as a result of a motor vehicle accident. I note in relation to that matter that he in fact discharged himself on the day of the accident, so he could not have been too badly injured. He also was admitted to hospital as a result of an assault, a head injury causing a wound after he was bitten on the head. There did not appear to be any evidence of concussion. He also suffered a hand injury from punching a person in the head. Apart from his asthma there were no continuing medical issues for the prisoner on the evidence available to this Court. 

64His sister gave some evidence of when skateboarding he suffered some head injuries. There is no medical evidence to confirm the extent of these injuries, their significance or whether they continue to affect him. 

65A large number of references were tendered from persons who have known the prisoner from varying periods of time in varying contexts. Some of the evidence referred to his sporting prowess, his involvement in Oztag in the Cronulla Sutherland area and in boxing, the ""sweet science"" that the prisoner should well stay away from one would have thought given his criminal background, as well as his involvement in skateboarding. Other references related to contact he had had with business associates and friends of his parents or contacts he had made through persons independent of his parents. The referees generally speak of the prisoner's involvement in drug manufacture as being uncharacteristic. This is no surprise bearing in mind his criminal history. Each referee speaks of their disappointment in the prisoner's involvement in serious crime, although some do not seem to be aware of his other criminal history. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a serious crime.

66I accept the theme of the references that the prisoner is a considerate person to others. He is helpful and willing from time to time to volunteer himself for community sport activity and other charitable works. He has made a contribution to Camp Good Time run by Sydney Children's Hospital to help families with children suffering from HIV Aids. Many of the referees were involved in organised sporting activities, business and professional pursuits. His referees include an accountant, a solicitor, a retired detective from the New South Wales Police Force, business people and the like. To these people the prisoner is a trustworthy person who has the capacity to make a responsible contribution to the community.

67The references from the family accountant and others confirm the financial difficulty of the prisoner's family, particularly the prisoner's father occurring prior to the prisoner's involvement in the current offending which threatened the business where prisoner was employed. The referees speak of the prisoner's helpfulness. 

68The prisoner in the interview with the Probation and Parole Service and the prisoner's sister provide some evidence, along with that of the family accountant's statement, that the prisoner's involvement in the commission of the current offence was in some way associated with what the accountant called ""constant financial pressure"" that the family was under in some way seeking to assist his parents to meet their ongoing financial commitments.

69The prisoner's father as I said is a licensed electrician who conducted his own business apparently for a number of years before striking financial difficulties because of poor advice from a financial advisor. I have no doubt that the financial difficulties for the family and problems that may have existed in conflict between the prisoner's mother and father over the mother's health created some stress for the prisoner. However, they have little, if any, causal connection with the commission of the current offence.

70The father was made a bankrupt as far as I can work out, with the appointment of a Trustee in Bankruptcy on 25 September 2009, more than a year before the commission of the offence. According to the prisoner's tax returns the prisoner continued to be employed by his father subsequent to his father's affairs being run by a Trustee of Bankruptcy. The prisoner earned $50,224 according to the tax return for the tax year ending 30 June 2010 and $40,047 for the tax year ending 30 June 2011. This was a year which included a month where the prisoner was in Thailand. It included the month that the prisoner was involved more or less with the Werris Creek activities and of course the prisoner was in custody from 10 May 2011. It would seem that the father's bankruptcy did not prevent him trading, or paying his son's wages.

71I accept that the father's financial circumstances may have threatened the prisoner's then employment and it may well be that he prisoner from whatever he was to receive from his involvement in this event he may have sought to assist is father or his parents in some way. However, absent evidence from the prisoner and denied any details from him as to what he was to receive for his involvement in his criminal activity, it is not possible to conclude that the commission of the crime was for altruistic reasons or solely altruistic reasons. In any event that would afford little in way of mitigation, if any, that the prisoner involved himself in serious criminal activity to assist his parents financially. This is not much consolation to the people that could be damaged by the use of the drugs.

72The truth of the matter is that the evidence suggests that the prisoner's involvement in the commission of this crime had more to do with his associations of that time, including his friendships with AM, MH and AF, particularly AF than providing assistance to his parents. I accept from the evidence of the referees that the prisoner is capable of being a hard worker and generally supportive of his parents. On the other hand if it were reasonably possible that the prisoner may have contributed proceeds of the criminal enterprise when they were received to assist his parents, given their standing in the community, if they had known of the source of the funds, I very much doubt that they would have accepted the offer from that source. He certainly did not seek his parents approval to commit the crime. There is reference in the evidence to the circumstances of the prisoner's finances at the time of the criminal enterprise showing that he, as I said earlier, had little in the way of savings.

73I have two psychological reports, one relating to treatment in 2006, 2007, particularly in relation to the charges of assault earlier referred to and an up to date report from Mr Watson-Munro dated 22 June 2012. The first report in time provides little assistance other than noting a pattern of aggressive behaviour and the assessment of the presence of depressive symptoms in a moderate range. This is supported by some of the discharge summaries from Sutherland Hospital, which refer to a history of depression at the time the prisoner was admitted to the hospital on occasions.

74This first psychological report notes his poor performance at school. The fact that he was taking prescribed anti-depressant medication in 2006 and 2007 and reports the obvious poor history of anger management. He was provided with advice in relation to the latter respect. References made in the report to treatment by a psychiatrist but now psychiatric reports have been tendered. It was recommended that he receive further treatment for his anger management.

75Mr Watson-Munro refers to the prisoner as a ""somewhat feckless individual"" who had been impacted upon by the stress of his father's financial difficulties and the resultant pressure upon the prisoner's employment. Mr Watson-Munro based much of what he concluded upon what the prisoner told him which is untested. He stated that the financial difficulties of the family principally the father was essentially the context in which the prisoner agreed to become involved in the current matters that lead to him being remanded in custody. This is an unsupported over-simplification of the situation as discussed elsewhere. As I said earlier the prisoner gave the psychologist no history of involvement with illicit drugs, stating substance abuse was not relevant to his criminality. He could not claim that he was a person who was involved in this to obtain drugs for his own use. 

76Reference was made to his head injury as a result of motor vehicle accident with possible long term affects. There was a statement made that a closed head injury might take twelve months for a person to return to what is described as ""Baseline Functioning"". The psychologist did not assert any signs of organic brain damage and as the motor vehicle accident in question, as far as I can work out from the evidence available to me, was in February 2006. The effects of it must have well and truly worn off by 2010. The medical notes show, in any event as I said earlier, that the prisoner presented with a headache after the motor vehicle accident and discharged himself on the same day, admittedly against advice.

77The prisoner has given the psychologist a history of poor impulse control and diminished threshold for frustration and ""galvanised"" sense of remorse once he came to grips with the realities of maximum security incarceration. He gave no indication of gross psychiatric disturbance, no thought disorder, delusions or any other mental illness. The only psychometric assessment that was applied, as I understand it, was revealed in the depression inventory which showed ""significant depression and anxiety"". Many of the symptoms recounted in the report reflect symptoms that are reasonably consistent as being reactive to his current circumstances.

78There is a reference to a lengthy interview with the parents who did not given evidence. Their particular difficulties are traversed. They asserted to the psychologist that the prisoner had significantly matured in gaol and that he had a tendency to be easily led. The psychologist noted that the prisoner was the youngest of the co-accused. The psychologist reports the expression of remorse to the parents and to himself. The psychologist opines that the history given by the parents reflects upon the prisoner's immaturity in concrete thinking. The psychologist in his conclusion states, ""The essential diagnosis in this case is that of an anxiety disorder according to DSM IV TR criteria"".

79He notes the prisoner's poor academic skills but has consider trade skills, underlying symptoms of inadequacy, impact of him being led in peer group situations and his claimed ""strong desire to assist the underdog"". Whilst that might assist him in fights down at ""Northies"" (North Cronulla Hotel) or other places, there is no explanation for him sticking up for the underdog as having any explanation for his involvement in this offence. 

80The psychologist states these matters do have relationship to his convictions of violence. The psychologist describes the prisoner as being a ""sensitive individual"" who ""tends to act without thinking"". Again these reflections are more personal opinions than matters of scientific fact quite obviously. Certainly it is clear that the prisoner had plenty of opportunity between 31 October and 16 December to think about what he was involved in. The psychologist expressed the opinion that the prisoner needed cognitive behaviour therapy, medication and family support. He had a ""very positive"" prognosis. 

81Of course, much of the psychologist report did not reflect upon other aspects of the prisoner's personality that may have contributed to his offending, including the strength of his friendships with the co-offenders as opposed to being ""easily led"".

82So far as the submissions are concerned the solicitor for the accused said the matter should be categorised as below the mid range. He noted that the prisoner's precise role was not clear and that he was not a financier. It was conceded however that he had a substantial role and the various matters I have outlined that really are not in dispute were acknowledged. However it was submitted that he was not a principal and it was submitted that he was not ""directly involved"" in the manufacture of the MDA ,there was no evidence that he was a chemist or had the necessary skills.

83A great deal of time was spent arguing about what he would have done during the period he was at Werris Creek. It seemed to me a great deal of time was wasted on this topic. The prisoner did not assist me in this regard beyond leaving open the fact that for a lengthy period of time either side of 3 and 4 December he was incommunicado, consistent with him being on the property and deliberately turning his phone off. As the prisoner has not assisted me, primarily because of his concern about his welfare, he has provided no direct evidence other than his admission of being involved in the relevant criminal enterprise and of course the nature of the criminal enterprise.

84There is absolutely no doubt that he was relevantly present at various times during the period of manufacture. Clearly he was involved for financial gain, although he has not assisted me with the extent of that. He may have been concerned to assist his parents in some way given their financial troubles, but again he has provided no direct evidence in relation to that matter.

85It was submitted that I should give the prisoner a twenty-five per cent discount for the utilitarian benefit of his plea of guilty. This is not disputed by the Crown. A plea of guilty was entered at the Local Court in a reasonable time after the prisoner had come back into custody. It was also submitted that the prisoner was relevantly contrite, had good prospects of rehabilitation, did not have a significant criminal history and whilst his involvement may be viewed as greater than MH he was entitled to consideration for a greater discount the different criminal history and the fact that he was not subject to conditional liberty. It was submitted there should be a finding of special circumstances.

86The Crown in its submissions correctly pointed out that the seriousness of the crime required specific and general deterrence. It noted the entitlement of the prisoner to the 25 percent discount. Reference was made to the High Court decision of R v Muldrock as it relates to a standard non-parole period (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39).

87The essence of the prosecution submissions in relation to joint criminal enterprise was that each person involved in a joint criminal enterprise was liable for the acts of the others. It was also submitted by reference to authorities such as Goundar and Breedon from 2001 and 1992 respectively, that this principle does not automatically mean that every participant in such a criminal enterprise shares the same degree of objective criminality. The assessment begins with the proposition that each intended the crime and each set out to carry it into effect. In this regard I note that the Crown has submitted with apparently no dispute, what arises from the judgments of R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [28], R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [160], per Hodgson JA (213) per McClelland CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ. In that judgment the majority said:

""Difficulties may whoever arise when a Court attempts to categorise the role of an offender in a criminal enterprise. Difficulties arise as the sentencing Judge is unlikely to know the full nature and extent of the roles of particular offenders within the enterprise. The applications of labels such as principal or middle order may obscure the assessment of what the offender did in leading to the erroneous sentencing process.""

88(Relying upon the High Court decision of the R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 particularly at [19] and [22]). 

89With regard to authority relied upon I also note a judgment cited by the Crown of R v KR [2012] NSWCCA 32, where their Honours (at [16] - [18]) cite passages from various judgments. In R v Sukkar [2011] NSWCAA 140 Latham J, speaking for the Court, said at [19] to [22] that what emerged from the various statements of sentencing principle is that the participants in a joint criminal enterprise are equally responsible or liable for all the acts in the course of carrying out the enterprise by whomsoever they are committed yet a particular participant's level of culpability stands to be assessed by reference to his or her particular conduct. She went on to say, inter alia, criminal responsibility and therefore liability to punishment attaches to the person voluntarily and intentionally performing those acts constituting the offence; citing O'Connor v The Queen. The concurrence of will and physical act and the concurrence of intent and physical act suffices to attract criminal liability. She went on to say (at [22]): 

""Culpability on the other hand is concerned with the assessment of an offender's moral responsibility for the offence as such. It assumes liability for the offence and focuses upon aspect of the offender's conduct and his subjective circumstances in order to determine the appropriate degree of punishment.""

90The Crown submits that the assessment begins with the fact that each participant in this joint criminal enterprise intended the crime set and set out to achieve it. Each participant carried out a role to achieve the desired goal. There will be occasions that will call for a differentiation between the participants and the enterprise. It is relevant to refer to the particular conduct of each participant so far as it is known to the Court with a view to identifying the level of culpability for each must be sentenced. Of course, the only culpability in detail that I can identify is that of MH, that SY is the ""financier"" and that AF, the rather shadowy associate of the prisoner was a principal in some degree not particularised, except on reputation.

91The Crown submits that this is an offence in the upper bracket of the middle range of objective seriousness for the various reasons set out in it's submissions. Some of those matters involve consideration of matters which it conceded, in oral submission, were irrelevant as I have pointed out the Crown. I appreciate, in terms of assessing the objective seriousness, the weight of the relevant prohibited drug and the value of it are not the sole determinants. I have not forgotten of course that the quantity seized is thirtyeight times the minimum amount proscribed by the Parliament for a large commercial quantity of MDMA.

92I accept the submission of the Crown that the accused came into the enterprise before 1 November and he set out with the others to conduct the crime for financial or material gain. This is acknowledged by his plea and by his plea he acknowledged that was intended to be done and what he knew or believed to be done was the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug or a prohibited drug. 

93The Crown submits that given the matters noted concerning the prisoner's involvement at an early stage his contact with the principal and the role of him speaking to Mr Reynolds, the prisoner should be identified as I said earlier as ""upper management"". It is submitted that the prisoner's role is ""more significant"" than that of MH and not less than AF. The Crown also submitted there was a justifiable basis for concluding there were special circumstances. 

94With regard to aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A, which of course are relevant in considering the standard non-parole period and the implications of Part 4, Division 1A as they are in all sentencing matters, ultimately it was conceded that the very character of the crime had the inherent qualities of planning and organisation, as was to some extent the financial gain. The Crown also said that the threat to public safety was intimately bound up in the characterisation of the offending by reference to both the nature of the crime and the maximum penalty that is available.

95The Crown referred to the likelihood of reoffending or the unlikelihood of reoffending and the prospects of rehabilitation and remorse shown by the prisoner as possible mitigating factors. It was conceded by the Crown that the prisoner did not have to give evidence to show contrition although his hearsay representation on the matter need not necessarily be accepted. So far as the plea of guilty was concerned it was merely a recognition of the inevitable and was in itself evidence of expression of remorse. 

96As to the distinction to be drawn between the prisoner and MH on the objective facts the Crown submits, as I said earlier, that the prisoner was more significantly involved than MH and must have a starting point in his sentence higher than that of MH. Ultimately, I have agreed with that submission. Obviously it follows from what the Crown has submitted and the character of the offending that the prisoner must face a significant term of imprisonment.

97A matter of substantial significance not addressed, it seems to me by the defence counsel nor the Crown, was the return of the prisoner to the jurisdiction. I appreciate when he returned to Australia he did not actually surrender himself but on the other hand he did not know when he wandered through Customs on 18 January 2011 that he was not going to be arrested. As it turned out he was not. He apparently led a peripatetic existence around the Cronulla area but frankly I could not believe that it would difficult finding him in that area. There is no evidence of what steps were taken to find him. I note the warrant issued for AF was issued in April, the prisoner was not arrested until 10 May. He must have known that his arrest was inevitable. Ultimately making himself available to the authorities to my mind is an important matter. The authorities did not have to go through the difficulties that had been required in bringing AF back into the country or even locating the prisoner overseas. He saved potential cost to the community of that exercise and I accept, although it was not expressly put, that ultimately the prisoner's return to Australia was an acceptance by him of the inevitable, not knowing of course at that stage where the police investigation had reached. I am mindful of the fact that the laboratory had not been found by the time that he returned but the prisoner would not have known the state of the police investigation and certainly would have feared the worst, given what had happened to MH being arrested in December 2010.

98Just turning briefly to Muldrock, to which I earlier referred, the High Court dealt with the consideration of Part 4, Division 1A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, setting out the concept of standard non-parole periods and the offences which attract standard non-parole periods. The Court's reasoning principally is set out at paragraph 17 to 29. Amongst other things the court said, at [17]: 

""It remained, and remains, essential to recognise, however, that the fixing of a non-parole period is but one part of the large task of passing an appropriate sentence upon the particular offender. Fixing the appropriate non-parole period is not to be treated as if it were the necessary starting point or the only important endpoint in framing a sentence to which (Part 4) Division 1A applies.""

99The common law in relation to sentencing continues to apply and should not be forgotten (see [18] to [20]). When determining the sentence for the offence the Court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. The Court went on to explain: 

""The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are those referred to in s 21A.""

100As to the approach to s 21A:

""(it) requires an approach to Division 1A offences consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen."" 

101The Court is required to ""identify all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case"" using what has been sometimes described as intuitive synthesis. The standard non-parole period is a legislative guidepost together with the maximum penalty. The objective seriousness of the offence does not include taking into account the characteristics of the offender, the objective seriousness of the offences to be assessed without reference to matters personal to the particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined solely by reference to the nature of the offending. There is no requirement for a two stage approach and of course standard non-parole periods are now directly relevant whether the sentence arises out of a plea of guilty or after trial and I note a number of authorities since Muldrock including, without giving references, Ayshow, MDZ, R Madden, Kirkbride, Phong Foster, Koloamatangi, Calcutt, Zreika, Yang and others. The case of Muldrock has obviously generated much debate.

102So ultimately, by reference to s 21A the only relevant aggravating factor, and it is as has been pointed out by the Crown this is to some extent bound up in the character of the offending, was that the offence was committed for financial gain. In this particular matter there was no actual injury or loss or damage caused by the good work of the police in intervening the shipment.

103I am prepared to find on the balance that the prisoner does not have a significant record of previous convictions, that the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend. I believe this term of imprisonment will ultimately be the salutary lesson that six or seven months in prison four or five years ago may have well served. 

104The prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to his relative youth and the support of his family. I am prepared to accept further, pursuant to s 21A(3) that although he did not give direct evidence in relation to the matter there is a consistent pattern of expression of remorse by the prisoner accepting responsibility for his actions. His having returned to Australia as I have pointed out might be seen as evidence of that. The plea of guilty alone does not prove that. I accept that there are many other matters to take into account and he has acknowledged such loss and injury that has occurred. The plea of guilty is of course a mitigating factor but that is a matter for which he receives the benefit of a discreet penalty (as said) but it is to be considered pursuant to s 22 of the Act.

105Ultimately, noting the findings of Her Honour Judge Payne, which I understand are the not the subject of challenge by the Crown although MH is considering his options as far as an appeal is concerned, I conclude that the relevant objective seriousness of the offending, with which I am concerned, is such that it can be categorised as within the midrange, slightly higher than that assessed for MH primarily because of the evidence available to this court. 

106It shows that the prisoner was involved in the criminal enterprise longer than MH. I point out that there's no evidence that he did very much between 2 November and the date that the glassware was delivered to AF's premises at Yowie Bay. From the commencement of MH's participation, however, he was as with the prisoner to my view of the matter just as involved and I notice I have said earlier that ultimately after the manufacture MH was entrusted with the drugs that were manufactured. 

107In assessing the objective seriousness of the matter I have noted the quantity of the prohibited drug, the purity of it and what could be called the substantial, but in the range of cases of this type relatively modest, wholesale value of the drugs. The range of offences that this court deals with, dealing with MDA, MDMA or methylamphetamine just coming into my court, includes a range of values of prohibited drugs even in wholesale form from thousands of dollars up to millions of dollars. There is no evidence of any ""worth"" of the prisoner's interest in the context of what the Crown defines as principals or ""upper management"". On balance I am not satisfied that the prisoner's involvement could be categorised, particularly in the absence of any evidence of any financial means, as either a principal or the rather vague position of ""upper management"". 

108The significant matters that operate in mitigation include the absence of past offences for drug supply in the context of what could be called a modest criminal record that certainly does him no credit, his relative youth, the contrition he has expressed, his plea of guilty and the discount that receives, the absence of any breach of conditional liberty on this occasion, a background of regular employment, good prospects of rehabilitation and to my mind the strong likelihood that the prisoner's involvement in this criminal enterprise arose more directly from his association with other people, particularly his association with AF than any self motivating force.

109I was given a range of comparable sentencing matters. Without seeking to cite the references these cases are from a period of time between 2000 and 2010 and including cases such as Kalach, DAB, Kalemusic, Cvitan, Hosseini, Walsh, Lin and Lau v The Queen, Song Lin v The Queen, The Queen v Parker and The Queen v Pedavoli. None of these cases, of course, are on all fours with the matter at bar. They relate in many instances to different prohibited drugs. In fact, as I understand it, they all relate to different prohibited drugs than the prohibited drug with which I am concerned. I am mindful of the fact that MDA, a relatively recent addition to the list of prohibited drugs as I would understand it, is considered a drug that might be seen as a substitute for MDMA. But I have no real evidence about its effect and other matters. The offenders involved in those various appeals played differing roles to the way in which one could categorise this prisoner's role and of course many of the offenders had other offences to be dealt with at the same time on a Form 1 or otherwise and had differing criminal histories. I have received some assistance, but limited assistance, from those comparative cases. 

110Thus, having surveyed what I understand to be the evidence as it is presented to me, trusting that I have dealt with all matters raised by the parties, without a transcript to assist me at any stage, and noting the starting point for MH, on my assessment that would have been eleven years, I have determined that the starting point for the sentence for this prisoner, all matters taken into account, should be twelve years imprisonment. With a discount of twentyfive percent it leaves a sentence of nine years. I have determined that there are ""special circumstances"" pursuant to section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The special circumstances are, in my view, the extended period of supervision the prisoner will require to adjust to community living. 

111In my view he will need professional assistance in relation to financial counselling, anger management if there is any anger left in him by the time he gets out of gaol and also he will need direction in relation to his associations. The days of hanging out with his mates from the Cronulla area that have brought him into this difficulty he should realise are over. Of course that is not going to stop him hanging out with friends that he has grown up with, but he will have to be far more discerning in his choice of associates and friends. You can stand up thanks very much Mr Ellis.

112In relation to the offence to which you have pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of six years, that will commence on 10 May 2011.

113HIS HONOUR: that's the correct date Mr Crown?

114OUTRAM: Yes your Honour.

115HIS HONOUR: It will expire on 9 May 2017. The balance of sentence will be three years, the balance of sentence will expire on 9 May 2020. Thank you, just take a seat.

2708016,R v Chandler; Chandler v R [2012] NSWCCA 135,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
2BASTEN JA:  The circumstances underlying this application have been fully explained by Hoeben JA, with whose conclusions I agree.  I would add the following reasons.
3The principle of parity called in aid by the applicant is not a principle which allows a broad review by an appellate court of the sentences imposed on two persons involved in a single criminal activity, in order to determine whether each is proportionate to the other.  Rather, it is one of a number of principles or objectives to be applied by the sentencing judge in determining the appropriate sentence.  It is one of those fundamental principles which more readily lend themselves to expression than to practical application: OM v R [2009] NSWCCA 267 at [3].  Being a principle, rather than a rule, it identifies a factor to be weighed in the process of determining the appropriate sentence.  It is, in effect, no more than a specific application of the equality principle, in relation to offenders involved in the same criminal activity: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36 at [28] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ); Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610-611 (Mason J); R v Green and Quinn [2010] NSWCCA 313; 207 A Crim R 148 at [3] (Allsop P and McCallum J).  
4In Green in the High Court at [105], Bell J noted that ""[t]he principle of parity in sentencing, stated by this Court in Lowe v The Queen, applies to the sentencing of co-offenders whose culpability for the offence and whose antecedents are comparable"".  For that assessment to be carried out, it is preferable that co-offenders be sentenced at one time by the same judge.  The sentencing judge will then routinely take into account, and determine, the individual levels of culpability and the antecedents of each offender, so as to achieve sentences which reflect elements of comparability and difference.  If, for example, persons involved in the same events are charged with different offences, the range of penalties available will be fed into the weighing process as mandatory, but disparate, considerations.  Similarly, despite being involved in the same conduct, each may be sentenced by reference to agreed facts (or facts as found) which differ and may even be inconsistent.  Parity does not entail identical outcomes, nor disregard of relevant differences.
5Parity usually becomes an issue only when, for example, co-offenders are sentenced by different judges.  The question then is the weight the second judge should give to the sentence imposed by the first.  In short, the earlier sentence becomes a mandatory element in the process of assessment to which appropriate weight should be given, depending on all the circumstances.  This involves no inflexible rule, breach of which constitutes error, but is merely part of the evaluative exercise to be reviewed under the principles articulated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.  To treat disparity as a form of error in itself is to risk departing from a proper understanding of the sentencing process, as discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357, one result of which may be to inflict a further level of complexity on the sentencing process.
6A second fallacy apparent from the submissions in this case is that because both the applicant and his co-offender were involved in the same conduct, parity required that they receive broadly similar sentences.  Courts act upon findings of fact as agreed by the parties or made by the Court.  There are often discrepancies between the facts upon which each offender is sentenced.  That was so in the present case.  The applicant complained that a much more serious view should be taken of his co-offender's role than that taken by English DCJ, who sentenced the co-offender.  That submission may be accepted, but it does not assist the applicant.  First, had English DCJ taken a more serious view of the co-offender's conduct, she would no doubt have imposed a greater sentence and the resultant disparity would have been reduced.  Secondly, the evidence before English DCJ was indeed quite different from that tendered on the applicant's sentencing.  The disparity was justified by the differing findings of their respective culpabilities.
7A second factor explaining the disparity was that the co-offender was charged with lesser offences.  In Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540, it was accepted that the parity principle applied in such circumstances, but that the differential charging could give rise to ""practical difficulties"": at [106].  That is a somewhat artificial way of viewing the issue.  The judge sentencing each offender, whether the same judge or different judges, must sentence for the offence for which each offender stands convicted or to which each has pleaded.  If one offence bears a lower level of culpability, as reflected in the maximum penalty, that is an important factor to be weighed in the sentencing.  It may not be decisive: the same conduct may be a low range example of the more serious offence, but a high range example of the less serious offence.  Taking such factors into account is only a ""difficulty"" if one starts with a presumption of equal outcomes: such a presumption is not in conformity with the process which involves a weighing of different and often conflicting factors.
8In truth, the applicant's complaint was of differential treatment by the prosecuting authority.  In terms of broad principle, such a complaint may be valid.  Prosecuting authorities should not ""play favourites"" or treat differentially those who are similarly situated, without justification.  It is possible that, in the exercise of a broad power to prevent abuse of process and to ensure the fair administration of justice, a sentencing court may be able to take steps to address such a complaint.  But to accept the possible existence of such a power is to say little about its operation in particular circumstances.  Thus, for the applicant to assert that his co-offender had received preferential treatment without justification, not only raised unaddressed questions as to how the assertion might be made good, but also an unaddressed question as to how he should benefit from a finding to that effect.  In its terms, such a finding would not self-evidently result in him receiving lesser sentences than those warranted by his convictions and pleas, which sentences were not themselves excessive.
9Subject to these additional reasons, I agree with Hoeben JA.
10HOEBEN JA:  Offences and sentenceBecause there is an appeal by the Crown and an application for leave to appeal by the offender, I propose for ease of reference, to refer to the offender as ""the applicant"".
11The applicant was found guilty after a trial of four offences:
Count 1:  On 22 March 2009 at Blaxland being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, did rob Stanley Clark, contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.
Count 2:  On 22 March 2009 at Blaxland did drive a motor vehicle knowing the said vehicle had been taken without the consent of the owner, contrary to s 154A(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.
Count 3A:  On 22 March 2009 at Cabarita being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, did assault Reg Addison with intent to rob him, contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.
Count 4:  On 22 March 2009 at Cabarita being in company with Susanna Leota-Lu did assault Moira Addison with intent to rob her, contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.
12After having been convicted of these offences, the applicant pleaded guilty to a further armed robbery offence on 17 April 2009 at Werrington.  The victim was a delivery driver (Dezshun Su Doo).  The applicant admitted his guilt to an offence of aggravated carjacking, arising from the same incident, and requested that offence be taken into account on a Form 1.
13The applicant came before Judge Armitage for sentence on 8 November 2011.  His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:
Count 3A - Assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon - the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years commencing 22 July 2009 and expiring 21 July 2012.
Count 4 - Assault with intent to rob whilst in company - the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 ½ years commencing 22 January 2010 and expiring 21 July 2013.
Count 1 - Armed robbery at Blaxland - the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 22 January 2011 and expiring 22 January 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 21 January 2015.
Count 2 - Driving a conveyance knowing it was taken without consent - the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months commencing 22 January 2011 and expiring 21 January 2012.
14For the armed robbery at Werrington, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 ½ years commencing 21 January 2012 and expiring 21 July 2014 with a balance of term of 2 ½ years expiring 21 January 2017.  The Form 1 matter of aggravated carjacking was attached to this offence.
15The effective sentence passed by his Honour was imprisonment with an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years commencing 22 July 2009 and expiring 21 July 2014 with a balance of term of 2 ½ years expiring 21 January 2017.
16The Crown has appealed pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by his Honour on the following grounds.
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in his approach to the issue of mental illness rendering each of the individual sentences manifestly inadequate.
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in failing to adequately accumulate the sentences leading to a manifestly inadequate overall sentence.
Ground 3 - The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate in terms of individual sentences and overall sentence.
17The applicant seeks leave to appeal from his Honour's sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - Contrary to the submission of the Crown, Mr Chandler has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the disparity between the sentence delivered by Armitage DCJ when compared with that delivered by English DCJ upon his co-offender, Ms Susanna Leota-Lu.
Ground 2 -  Concepts of ""equal justice"" should govern the sentencing procedures in New South Wales when issues of parity arise.
Ground 3 -  The substance of ""equal justice"" is based on the considerations raised in pars [28] - [34] of the High Court decision in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 (6 December 2011).
Ground 4 - Armitage DCJ failed to discern the anomaly between the leniency which had been extended to Ms Leota-Lu by English DCJ and the failure of the Crown to accept that leniency when sentencing Mr Chandler.
Ground 5 - His Honour erred in failing to accept the defence submission that the sentence of Ms Leota-Lu could not be ignored in the sentencing of Mr Chandler.
Ground 6 - The Crown prosecutor with the carriage of the matter should have ensured the solicitor who appeared on the sentence of Ms Leota-Lu before English DCJ was instructed to contest the proposition that Ms Leota-Lu was not an active participant in the robberies at Blaxland and Cabarita.
Ground 7 - In the face of the Agreed Facts placed before English DCJ, the failure of the Crown to contest the proposition that Ms Leota-Lu was not an active participant gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of Mr Chandler.
Ground 8 - The concept of prosecutorial discretion cannot be utilised to neutralise the proposition that a convicted person in the position of Mr Chandler cannot have a justified sense of grievance when a fellow participant in a common criminal enterprise is charged with lesser offences.
Ground 9 - The concept of prosecutorial discretion is justiciable in circumstances where, on the face of the record, the prosecution has treated co-offenders differently by vigorously prosecuting sentence proceedings against one co-offender while leaving self-serving evidence given by a co-offender unchallenged.
Factual background
18The background facts to the Blaxland and Cabarita offences were agreed (ROS 4-7).  In relation to the armed robbery offence at Werrington, an agreed set of facts was tendered.  At the time of the Blaxland and Cabarita offences, the applicant was subject to a s 9 good behaviour bond.
Blaxland offences
19On the afternoon of 22 March 2009 the applicant robbed an elderly gentleman (Stanley Clark) at knifepoint in a car-park at Blaxland.  The applicant held a knife with about a 10 cm blade under the throat of Mr Clark and said words to the effect that he would be stabbed if he did not hand over money.  The victim handed over his wallet which contained $300, some bank cards and other personal items.  The applicant then left the scene in a car that had been stolen some time previously.  His girlfriend, Susanna Leota-Lu, was a passenger in the vehicle.
20After the robbery, police were alerted to the existence of the stolen car which was sighted travelling at high speed along the M4.  The police engaged in a chase but desisted because of the dangerous manner in which the car was being driven.
Cabarita offences
21Later on the afternoon of 22 March 2009 the applicant discarded the stolen car in a car-park at Cabarita.  While on foot with his girlfriend in the Cabarita area, he saw an elderly couple (Reg Addison and Moira Addison) opening a garage after driving home.  Reg Addison turned around to be confronted by the applicant who was armed with a knife.  The applicant demanded his car keys and lunged at him.  Mr Addison twisted away from the knife which grazed his side causing a laceration.  The applicant continued to wave the knife at Mr Addison and demanded the keys.
22While this was occurring, the applicant's girlfriend demanded that Mrs Addison give the car keys to her.  She grabbed Mrs Addison by the shirt and started grappling with her.  Mrs Addison broke free and ran to the roadway calling for help.  The applicant's girlfriend followed her and grabbed her again.  The applicant then walked towards Mrs Addison and struck her in the face, causing her to fall to the ground.  Mrs Addison suffered fractures to her nose, which required surgery to reset, and bruising around both her eyes.  
23The applicant and his girlfriend were chased from the scene.  They returned to the car which they had discarded earlier in the car-park.
Werrington offences
24On the evening of 17 April 2009 the victim Dezshun Su Doo (18 years old) was working as a delivery driver for a Chinese restaurant at Werrington and had placed some orders in the car that he used for deliveries.  He was approached by the applicant and another unknown man.  The applicant grabbed the victim and placed a knife to his throat, demanding his keys and money.  
25The applicant took cash, car keys and a mobile phone from the victim.  He punched the victim in the nose and upper lip area, causing the victim's nose to bleed.  The applicant and the unknown male then jumped into the delivery car and drove away.
26The applicant and his girlfriend were arrested at the applicant's family property in Mudgee on 22 April 2009.  Both were refused bail.
Remarks on sentence
27His Honour reviewed the applicant's criminal record.  The applicant was born in January 1976.  Although there were a number of matters on his criminal record, none were as serious as those for which the applicant was to be sentenced.
28The most serious offences were: 1993 common assault; 1995 assault occasioning actual bodily harm and resisting arrest; 1997 malicious wounding; 1998 contravening AVO, shoplifting and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty (2 counts); 1999 assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty (2 counts) and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty; assaulting a person with intent to resist and prevent apprehension; resisting an officer in the execution of his duty.  There were two convictions for shoplifting in 2010.  
29There was an issue between the Crown and the applicant as to whether, and if so to what extent, the applicant's mental illness had contributed to the commission of these offences.  In that regard, the applicant was seen by Dr Ellis, psychiatrist, on 6 November 2010.  The applicant told Dr Ellis that he had no recollection of having committed the offences.
30Dr Ellis recorded that the applicant had first seen a psychiatrist at the age of 7.  This was for head banging and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  He was first prescribed anti-depressants at the age of 18.  The applicant told Dr Ellis of numerous admissions to psychiatric hospitals from the age of 18.  Initially his admissions were for substance abuse, gambling and depression but later admissions were for depression and substance induced psychosis.  On one occasion he was involuntarily admitted by the police to the Rozelle Hospital.  The applicant had made a number of suicide attempts.  There was a long history of scarring himself with razorblades.
31The applicant began drinking alcohol at the age of 16 and smoking cannabis from the age of 18.  He was using speed intravenously on a daily basis from 2006 until he went into custody.  He had been using heroin while in his 20's, up to the age of 27.
32Dr Ellis in his report gave the following diagnosis:
""Axis 1 (Mental Disorders)
He would meet criteria for Stimulant and Cannabis Dependence, with significant tolerance and salient use despite negative physical and psychological consequences.  He has a history of dependence on opioids and alcohol in addition.
He would meet criteria for Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood.  This may develop into post traumatic stress disorder if symptoms persist in the future.
He describes historical treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  This disorder is very difficult to diagnose in the presence of concentration altering substance dependence.  I would prefer to defer this diagnosis at this point.
He does not report any psychotic symptoms currently.  I note there is a record of historical Substance Induced Psychosis.  He was not able to describe what psychotic symptoms he experienced in the past at this interview.
Axis 11 (Personality and Intellectual Function)
He describes a history of unstable emotional regulation, difficulties in relationships, impulsive behaviour, and recurrent suicidal and self-mutilatory behaviour.  He has an unstable self image and concept.  This is consistent with the diagnosis of Personality Disorder.  There was a history of Conduct Disordered behaviour in childhood.  The Personality Disorder has mixed features of borderline and antisocial traits.
There is no evidence for an intellectual disability ...
Mental State at Material Time
His mental state at the material time is difficult to determine as he reports a complete lack of memory for the period.  It is plausible given the amount of substance use reported that he would remain amnestic for some periods of time.  Amphetamines may impair the laying down of memory.  Highly emotionally charged events may be poorly recorded in memory.  It may be that over time his lost memory resolves.  He reports that he was continuing treatment for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at this time.  The effects of Dexamphetamine are likely to have been overwhelmed by the intravenous methamphetamine use at the time and unlikely to have significantly affected his mental state.  It is most likely that the amount of intoxication with amphetamines and cannabis described impaired his ability to restrain impulses, concentrate, solve problems and increase use of aggression.  It is possible that he was easily suggestible and easily talked into acting in an aggressive manner to other persons.  His underlying personality is one of impaired impulse control compared to the general population and this would likely have been exacerbated by intoxication.  His ability to focus and concentrate is possibly worse than the general population.  (If his ADHD symptoms persisted to adulthood), and this cognitive performance would have been worsened by intoxication.  It is possible that his inability to recall the events is due to an unwillingness to recall, rather than any specific psychopathology.
He did not describe any psychotic symptoms (delusions or hallucinations) at the material time or in the months before hand.  The description of events in the attached Facts Sheets do not indicate behaviour that is suggestive of psychotic symptoms.  
It is likely that his ability to form an intention was impaired but not totally deprived by the combination of substance abuse, personality disorder and possible ADHD at the index times.  His ability to martial impulses, reflect on decisions, problem solve and restrain anger would likely have been impaired if intoxicated and therefore untreated for his underlying psychiatric conditions.  The ability to use those cognitive and emotional skills was not likely however to have been absent.
He has significant experience with intoxication with substances, including education regarding the effects of substance use while attending substance use rehabilitation and would have likely been able to foresee the effect of substance use on his mental state prior to engaging in that use.""
33His Honour interpreted that report as indicating an impaired ability on the part of the applicant to form an intention and to understand the effects of his actions at the time of his offending.  In the opinion of Dr Ellis this was due partly to his intoxication by drugs (which his Honour accepted was not a mitigating factor on sentence) and partly to his underlying mental illness.
34The applicant was also seen by Professor Greenberg, psychiatrist, in September 2011 while he was in custody.  His Honour had a copy of Professor Greenberg's report (23 September 2011) before him.  The history recorded by Professor Greenberg was similar to that recorded by Dr Ellis, i.e. that the applicant had a chronic life long problem with the use of illicit substances and alcohol.  Professor Greenberg took a history of many admissions to private psychiatric clinics, as well as public hospital psychiatric facilities, including The Northside Psychiatric Clinic, St John of God in North Richmond, St Edmonds in Eastwood and the Rozelle Psychiatric Hospital.
35His Honour recorded the diagnosis of Professor Greenberg  on p 6 of his report as follows:
""Diagnostically Mr Chandler has a history of poly substance dependence associated with significant personality problems (personality disorder).  He has a history of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as a child and a history of anxiety and depression.  Despite his parents' numerous attempts at seeking private and public resources to assist him in addressing his addiction problems and his psychiatric problems, he has had difficulties abstaining from illicit substances and addressing his other personality and lifestyle problems.  Cognitively Mr Chandler has the capacity to understand his actions and the rightfulness and wrongfulness of such actions.  He continues to suffer from depressive and anxiety symptoms.  He is currently under the care of Justice Health Mental Health Services.  He is currently receiving antidepressant medication and continues to be monitored for suicide risk.  The writer contacted the Mental Health Nurse at the MRRC to inform them about Mr Chandler's threat that if he receives a lengthy sentence he will attempt suicide.  At the time of my psychiatric assessment he currently remains on risk intervention procedures with regard to self-harming behaviour.""
36On the basis of that expert opinion, his Honour concluded:
""I have set out the matters relating to expert opinion in detail in order to make clear the basis upon which I have reached the finding that the offender was in fact substantially impaired by mental illness at the time of his offending, in relation to his ability to restrain the impulse to offend and form an intention to offend with full knowledge of his consequences.  ...  One very frequently sees cases where an offender is retrospectively diagnosed with a mental condition said to have existed at the time of his offending and said to have contributed to his offending in circumstances where he has never previously been treated or apparently showed any evidence of mental illness.  This is not such a case. ...  Nevertheless, I ask myself is there any reason why I should not accept Dr Ellis' expert view that the offender's capacity to form an intention to offend or perhaps more correctly to appreciate fully what he was doing in offending was impaired by mental illness, I find no such reason. ...  I do find that the offender had impaired capacity to form an intention to offend at the time of the relevant offences albeit not to the extent where a jury could find and did find that such an intention was absent so as to acquit the accused of the offences for which he stood trial.""  (ROS 17-18)
37Similarly his Honour saw:
 ""... no reason not to accept Dr Greenberg's multiple diagnoses of mental illness, coming as they do in sensibly and moderately argued report commissioned by the Crown.
It seems to me that drug intoxication acted on these mental health problems to produce the offending, so that it was caused both by that intoxication and by those mental health problems.  I think that is a correct view of the psychiatric evidence in this case.""  (ROS 19.8 - 20.1)
38His Honour concluded that a custodial sentence might weigh more heavily on the applicant because of his mental illness.  In that regard, he referred specifically to the difficulties which the applicant had already experienced in prison and which had been referred to by Professor Greenberg.  His Honour found, in addition, that the applicant's mental health problems could not be adequately dealt with while he was in prison and that was a matter which he was entitled to take into account (El Jalkh v R [2011] NSWCCA 236).
39By reference to the matters referred to in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36] his Honour concluded that the first point of relevance had been established for the reasons set out in the medical reports, i.e.
""Mental illness may be relevant on sentence where it contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way.  In those circumstances, an offender's moral culpability may be reduced and there may not be the same call for denunciation and punishment warranted and may accordingly be reduced.""
40For the same reasons, his Honour made a finding in accordance with the second point of relevance in Hemsley that ""mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and modify that consideration"".  In relation to the applicant, his Honour said:
""I consider that general deterrence is still a relevant factor upon sentencing in this case, although somewhat less so than would have been the case had mental illness not contributed to the offender's offending.""  (ROS 21.3)
41His Honour found that the fourth consideration in Hemsley did not apply namely, ""a fourth and countervailing consideration may arise, namely the level of danger which the offender presents to the community which may sound in special deterrence"".  His Honour found ""there is no suggestion in the extensive psychiatric evidence as I read it that there is any greater likelihood that the offender will offend again as a result of mental illness"" (ROS 21.7).
42His Honour went on to say:
""[Professor Greenberg] did not couple these remarks with any suggestion that the offender is more likely to re-offend because of his mental illness although I have no doubt that if his mental health problems are not properly treated, both in gaol and in the community, there is a very significant risk of re-offending.  There is no suggestion, however, that this particular offender presents in the sense described in Hemsley by Sperling J, a greater than usual risk of re-offending because of his mental illness unless it is untreated - which I propose to ensure does not occur - so I do not think that factor applies in this case.""  (ROS 21.9 - 22.3)
43Although neither psychiatrist directed his opinion to the offences at Werrington, his Honour concluded that given the extensive analysis by both doctors and the temporal closeness of those offences to the others, and because of the similarity in circumstances, he should take account of the applicant's mental illness in relation to those offences.  This was a finding open to him on the evidence.
44His Honour concluded that his finding of mental illness on the part of the applicant, together with the need for a long period of parole supervision, justified a finding of special circumstances.
45Counsel for the applicant raised the issue of parity with his Honour.  He submitted that the sentence received by the applicant's girlfriend, Ms Leota-Lu, should be taken into account when sentencing the applicant.  His Honour rejected that submission.
46His Honour rejected the submission for the following reasons.
""Mr Berwick submitted that Ms Lu's involvement at Cabarita was immediate and substantial and that is indeed the case as set out in the facts I find on the sentences set out above.  Nevertheless it is also true as I observed at the time, that Ms Lu pleaded guilty to a different offence in relation to the Cabarita events as compared with the present offender.""  (ROS 23.9 - 24.1)
""As to parity with Ms Leota-Lu, I observed at this point that the factors contraindicating this were firstly that Ms Leota-Lu got a discount for assistance, though unquantified, secondly that she pleaded guilty at a relatively early stage and received a 20 percent reduction in respect of that, and thirdly that she shares with the offender only the offence of assault with intent to rob Moira Addison.  But even in relation to that offence she does not share the element of ""in company"" with him so it is still a different offence.  
Ms Leota-Lu's sentencing bundle was exhibit D before me and she was sentenced by her Honour Judge English in this court on 15 September 2011.  Count 1 faced by her was that on 22 March 2009 at Blaxland knowing Benjamin Chandler committed the offence of being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, and robbing Stanley Clark.  ... she assisted Benjamin Chandler contrary to s 97(1) and s 349 of the Crimes Act.  For that she received a fixed term of 10 months imprisonment, commencing 20 October 2009 and expiring 19 August 2010.
The second count she faced was that on 22nd March 2009, in Cabarita in the State of New South Wales she assaulted Moira Addison with intent to rob Moira Addison contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act.  For that she received a fixed term of imprisonment of 14 months, commencing 20 April 2010 and expiring 20 June 2011.  It was noted those offences had already been served by previous custody.
The third count she faced was that on 22nd March 2009 at Cabarita, whilst in the company of Benjamin Chandler, she assaulted Moira Addison thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm.  In respect of that offence she requested that three matters be taken into account on a Form 1, namely being carried in a conveyance knowing it to have been taken without the consent of the owner, and two counts of attempting to obtain a benefit by deception.  Those were to be taken into account in respect of the second count in the indictment set out above.  In respect of the third count, Ms Leota-Lu received a non-parole period of eleven months commencing 20 October 2010 and expiring 19 September 2011.  
The fourth count in the indictment to which Ms Leota-Lu pleaded guilty was an unrelated offence which does not require attention here.  
The factors I have already mentioned, indicating that there is no precise parity with Ms Leota-Lu in respect of the present offender, suggests to me in fact there is little if any parity at all.  That which weighs most heavily on my mind is that Ms Leota-Lu received a discount for assistance, though unquantified as is usual.  Also significant is the fact that she faced different counts even that in respect of Ms Moira Addison, because although it was otherwise similar, the element of ""in company"" was not faced by her.
I think I should simply say that I've taken her sentences into account on sentence here, but I do not think that they provide me with significant assistance in deciding on an appropriate sentence for the present offender in respect of the offences for which he faces sentence, nor do I think he would be entitled to have a justified sense of grievance as a result of a disparity between his sentences and those of Ms Leota-Lu in relation to the offences he committed with her.  The Crown submitted there was no parity at all and in fact I am in essential agreement with that proposition, except that I think I should note the sentences she received as Mr Berwick suggests.""  (ROS 31.3 - 33.2)
47His Honour then summarised the Crown case and indicated why he was not prepared to accept a number of its submissions.
48The Crown took his Honour to the guideline judgment in R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.  By reference to the specific criteria in Henry, the Crown submitted that these were individually more serious offences and that before taking into account considerations of totality, his Honour should consider sentences of 4 - 5 years for each of the robbery and intent to rob offences.  The Crown stressed the vulnerability of three of the victims because of their age, the fact that the Blaxland and Cabarita offences were committed while the applicant was subject to a bond and that the Cabarita offences were committed at the home of the victims.
49While generally recognising the force of the Crown's submissions, his Honour found that they did not adequately take account of the applicant's mental illness.  His Honour was prepared to accept that in part the applicant's offending was caused by his intoxication by drugs, but said:
"" ... it does not affect the view that I have already formed that mental illness also played a substantial part in causing the offender's offences, both those for which he stood trial and those at Werrington in which he has pleaded guilty.""  (ROS 30.5)
""This is not a case where I have moderated very substantially the penalty the offender would otherwise face in respect of any of the offences on account of mental illness.  It has however transformed it from a case where the top of the Henry guidelines or something above it should still be appropriate, and indeed into one where I have imposed the sentences I have in fact imposed ....""  (ROS 30.9)
""This is a difficult case because the offender is drug dependent and suffers from mental illness which contributed to his offending, in the view I have taken.  The proper approach is I think to moderate one's approach to sentence to a degree, recognising that there is a continuum in relation to mental illness and its contribution to offending, as indeed Dr Ellis suggested, particularly when drug dependence and intoxication, which is not a mitigating factor, applies as well, as it does here.  That is the approach I have taken.""  (ROS 34.9 - 35.1)
50It was on that basis that his Honour imposed the sentences which he did with only limited cumulation.
Crown appeal
51It is appropriate to deal with all three grounds of appeal together.  In doing so, I do not wish to denigrate the detailed written submissions provided by the Crown.  As was fairly conceded by the Crown in oral submissions, however, the real issue in the Crown appeal is whether his Honour gave undue weight to the applicant's mental illness so that both individually and in aggregate, the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.
52In making that submission, the Crown accepted that the sentencing exercise undertaken by his Honour was a difficult one.  It was not open to his Honour to simply apply the Henry guideline judgment to each offence to which it was relevant.  In order to avoid a crushing result, it was inevitable that a substantial level of concurrency would have to occur.  The Crown accepted that the psychiatric evidence was such that it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant's mental illness made a substantial contribution to his offending. The Crown also accepted that with multiple offences of this kind, complicated by the effects of mental illness, it was very difficult to determine what was an appropriate range of sentences available to his Honour.
53Even allowing for those concessions, and the effect of the applicant's mental illness, the Crown submitted that the sentences did not adequately reflect the serious objective circumstances of the offences.  In particular, the objective circumstances of three of the offences were more serious than those considered in Henry yet this was not reflected in either the individual sentences or the aggregate sentence imposed.  In essence, the Crown submitted the sentences were inadequate because they did not reflect the totality of the criminality involved.
54The Crown submitted that even though it could not, except to a limited degree, identify patent error in his Honour's approach, the terms of the sentences, both individually and in aggregate, were indicative of error.  The specific error to which the Crown referred was his Honour's finding that adequate treatment for the applicant's mental illness would not be available while he was in custody.
55The difficulty for the Crown is that his Honour made specific findings that the applicant was substantially impaired by mental illness at the time of offending.  The nature of the impairment was its adverse effect on the applicant's capacity to form an intention to offend and to correctly appreciate fully what he was doing in offending.  Both Dr Ellis and Professor Greenberg diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a number of psychiatric conditions at the time of his offending.  There was a solid evidentiary basis for his Honour's findings and it was not submitted that these findings were not open.
56It is also true that the applicant's offending was in part due to his intoxication by drugs and that the effect of his mental illness on his behaviour was exacerbated by that intoxication.  It is difficult to disentangle that combination of influences in the sentencing process but it was a task which his Honour had to undertake.
57Previous decisions have provided guidance as to the correct approach in such circumstances.  In Henry, Wood CJ at CL said at [253] - [254]:
""253  The relevant principle as stated in Letteri by Badgery-Parker J, in a passage adopted by Gleeson CJ in Engert is as follows:
""... that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise.""
254  The reason for this approach lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice.""
58That statement of principle was approved by Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Blanch JJ agreed) in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [25] as follows:
""25  Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it: 
""... specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such."" (Tsiaras, supra, at 400)
26  Finally, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of the sentence to be served. (See Tsiaras, supra, at 400). ...
27  Difficulties arise where there is an element of congruence of drug addiction and mental illness, in separating the effect of mental illness, see e.g. R v Alexander (2000) 118 A Crim R 350, esp at [41]-[45]; R v Pavlov [2001] NSWCCA 13 at [46]-[47].
28  Her Honour made a number of findings of fact in this regard that I have set out above. She identified the mental illness as a relevant factor, both in terms of culpability and also in terms of rehabilitation. These findings were, in my opinion, open to her Honour. The mental illness involved in the present case was of a particularly high order and gave rise to issues of culpability, personal deterrence and general deterrence, as well as rehabilitation. In these circumstances, in my opinion, it was open to her Honour to conclude that a term of imprisonment of two years was appropriate. ""
59Statements to similar effect were made by Beazley JA, with whom Howie J agreed, in Regina v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; 167 A Crim R 436:
""48 In circumstances where mental illness is not sufficient to constitute a defence, it remains a relevant consideration in the sentencing process.  Typically, its relevance relates to the emphasis that will be given to deterrence:  see R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, in which Spigelman CJ noted at [18] and [22] that mental illness may mean that a court will place less emphasis on both specific and general deterrence.  In R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400 the Victorian Court of Appeal said that ""specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such"" where the offender is affected by a serious mental illness.  In Israil, Spigelman CJ pointed out, however, that the relevance of mental illness in the sentencing process extends beyond the questions of general and specific deterrence.  His Honour said at (23):
""To the extent that mental illness explains the offence ... then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law.""""
60More recently the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 said:
""53 ... Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this:
""General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.""
In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way:

""[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.""
54 The principle is well recognised. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.""
55 In this case, there was unchallenged evidence of the causal relation between the appellant's retardation and his offending in the reports of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels. The fact that the appellant possessed the superficial understanding of a mentally retarded adult that it was wrong to engage in sexual contact with a child and that he told childish lies in the hope of shifting the blame from himself were not reasons to assess his criminality as significant, much less to use him as a medium by which to deter others from offending.""
61As his Honour pointed out, the mental illness from which the applicant suffered at the time of the offending was not something which had been diagnosed for the first time following his arrest and incarceration.  The applicant had been subject to mental illness of various types from an early age.  This was well documented, including many admissions to psychiatric hospitals.  Even though the applicant's mental illness was complicated by his substance abuse, it was open to his Honour to find, as he did, that the mental illness itself had contributed to the offending.
62When his Honour's finding to that effect is taken into account, the significance of the criminality involved in the offences is reduced, as is the importance of general deterrence.  Such an approach is in line with the statements of principle set out above.
63There is, of course, the countervailing consideration to which the authorities refer, i.e. the protection of the public.  In this case while it is correct to say that the sentence imposed by his Honour is at the bottom of the range of available sentences (to the extent that any appropriate range can be determined given the particular circumstances of the applicant), the aggregate sentence imposed is not insignificant.  There are, as Dr Greenberg pointed out, appropriate treatment regimes available for the applicant while serving his sentence and a substantial period of supervision while on parole, has been built into the sentence.
64There is also this consideration.  The episodes of offending took place over quite a short time.  Apart from one incident many years before, there was nothing in the applicant's criminal history which matched the objective seriousness of these offences.  Significantly, in the ten years leading up to these offences, the applicant's involvement with the criminal law had been sporadic and relatively minor.
65In the circumstances, it was clearly open to his Honour to be satisfied that the protection of the public did not require the imposition of a longer aggregate sentence.
66The Crown, in its submissions, did identify an error in his Honour's analysis of the facts.  It was incorrect for his Honour to say that the applicant would not receive adequate treatment while he was in custody.  The only evidence on the subject was that of Professor Greenberg and it was that adequate treatment was available for him.  The reasoning behind his Honour's conclusion in that regard is obvious, i.e. during his time in custody leading up to the sentence proceedings, the applicant had not done well.  Nevertheless, his Honour was not justified in making the specific finding which he did.  
67Although that error has been identified, it is not an error of the kind which would justify the intervention of this Court so as to re-sentence the applicant.
68The conclusion I have reached is that the sentences passed by his Honour, both individually and in aggregate, although being very much towards the bottom of the range, were open to him.  This is so because of the findings which his Honour made as to the applicant's mental illness.  On the particular facts of this case, I am not satisfied that latent error has occurred so that the sentences imposed by his Honour should be regarded as manifestly inadequate.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the Crown appeal.  
Applicant's appeal
69Before examining the applicant's submissions, it is necessary to set out the offences with which Ms Leota-Lu was charged, the findings which were made in her sentence proceedings and the sentences which she received.
70Ms Leota-Lu was charged with the following offences:
Count 1 - On 5 March 2009 did demand by force from Storm Hayden a mobile phone with intent to steal it, contrary to s 99 Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.
Count 2 - On 22 March 2009 at Blaxland knowing Benjamin Chandler to have committed the offence of being armed with a knife and robbing Stanley Clark of his wallet, did assist the said Benjamin Chandler, contrary to s 97(1) and s 349 Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.
Count 3 - On 22 March 2009 at Cabarita did assault Moira Addison with intent to rob her, contrary to s 94 Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.
Count 4 - On 22 March 2009 at Cabarita whilst in the company of Benjamin Chandler did assault Moira Addison thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm, contrary to s 59(2) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years.
71Ms Leota-Lu asked the court to take into account three matters on a Form 1 - being carried in a conveyance knowing it was taken without the consent of the owner and two counts of attempting to obtain a benefit by deception.  Those two counts related to an attempt to use credit cards taken from Mr Clark.
72The Agreed Facts were the same as set out for the applicant, except that in the case of the robbery of Mr Clark, Ms Leota-Lu while seated in the vehicle said words to the effect ""Hurry up, take the whole bag"".  The factual background to Count 1 involved Ms Leota-Lu demanding that Ms Hayden hand over her phone and when she refused, attempting to grab the phone from her grasp.  When Ms Hayden walked away, Ms Leota-Lu followed her and pushed her in the shoulder and grabbed her hair so that a struggle ensued until broken up by two of Ms Hayden's friends.
73Ms Leota-Lu was sentenced as follows:
Count 1 - A fixed term of imprisonment for 10 months commencing 20 October 2009 and expiring 19 August 2010.
Count 2 - A fixed term of imprisonment for 14 months commencing 20 April 2010 and expiring 19 June 2011.
Count 3 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months commencing 20 October 2010 and expiring 19 September 2011, with a balance of term of 13 months expiring on 19 October 2012.
Count 4 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months commencing 20 October 2010 and expiring 19 August 2011 with a balance of term of 4 months, expiring 19 December 2011.
The aggregate sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months, commencing 20 October 2009 with a balance of term of 1 year and 1 month, expiring 19 October 2012.
74Ms Leota-Lu pleaded guilty to the offences.  She gave evidence at the sentence proceedings.  English DCJ handed down sentence on 15 September 2011.  Judge English made the following specific findings concerning Ms Leota-Lu:
(i) She was aged 25 at the time of sentencing and had a lengthy criminal record.
(ii) She had a disrupted childhood.  She was born in New Zealand but when the family came to Australia, she was a victim of child sexual assault and physical abuse.  She returned to New Zealand under the care of her grandparents for her own safety.  She became addicted to drugs and alcohol at an early age.
(iii) Her relationship with the applicant was violent.  At the time of her arrest, she was observed to have injuries requiring hospital treatment following an assault upon her by the applicant.
(iv) At the time of the robbery at Blaxland, she was unaware that the applicant used a knife to demand money from Mr Clark and she attempted to take money from the ATM using Mr Clark's card because the applicant had threatened her.
(v) She was prepared to assist the police in the proceedings against the applicant, but ultimately her assistance was not required.
(vi) In relation to the Blaxland offence, her Honour found:
""I find that her role was limited.  There is certainly no evidence to suggest she was involved in the planning of the robbery, indeed her unchallenged evidence is to the contrary as I have said she was not the driver of the get away car and nor did she dispose of the knife used.  Her moral culpability therefore I find falls towards the lower end of the scale.""  (ROS 10.8)
""Clearly in respect of the accessory after the fact at Blaxland, the offender was acting under a degree of duress.  She was fearful of her co-offender as she had suffered violence at his hands previously.  She says she was told by the co-offender to stay put and she did so.""  (ROS 13.1)
(vii) In relation to the Cabarita offence, her Honour found:
""There was clearly no planning on her part although she willingly engaged in the assault upon the older woman and facilitated the assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed by Chandler resulting in quite serious injury for an older person.  It was I find a spontaneous offence on her part, rather than one involving planning or the targeting of the victims.  It did not involve the use of a weapon and they are matters which reduce the seriousness of the offence committed.""  (ROS 11.7)
(viii) Her Honour allowed a 20 percent discount to Ms Leota-Lu for her pleas of guilty and a further 20 percent for her assistance to the authorities (ROS 12.1).  
(ix) Her Honour made the following findings as to health issues:
""I find she was someone suffering from borderline personality disorder as diagnosed by Dr Richard Furst, stemming from her unresolved issues arising out of her childhood, making her more vulnerable to the likes of her co-offender.  I find she was someone who coped poorly with emotional stress and who was self-medicating on illicit substances.  I find the reason she engaged in this type of criminal behaviour was to obtain funds to support her habit.""  (ROS 12.6)
(x) In relation to parity, her Honour said:
""The issue of parity does not arise her co-offender stood trial and was found guilty after trial.  She had entered pleas of guilty and she is entitled to a discount for her assistance in addition to the discount for her pleas.  I find on the facts before me she was morally less culpable in the offences than her co-offender in any event.""  (ROS 15.5)
75It is against that background that the applicant's submissions have to be considered.  It would be fair to say that the grounds of appeal and the submissions are novel.
76As a start point, the applicant submits that this Court should not only reject the findings of English DCJ in relation Ms Leota-Lu but should critically analyse the evidence which was before her Honour and determine for itself whether her Honour's findings were open and if this Court concluded that such findings were not open, to make its own findings.
77The applicant submitted that ""Judge English's analysis of Ms Leota-Lu's situation was manifestly inadequate"" (AWS 5) and ""Her Honour has essentially accepted the proposition Ms Leota-Lu was an unwilling participant in both these robberies.  That proposition cannot stand in the face of the objectively considered realities"" (AWS 9).  The ""objectively considered realities"" were not identified, but would seem to comprise an interpretation of the facts which favoured the applicant.
78One only has to follow through the implications of this submission for its erroneous basis and impracticality to become obvious.
79As was stated by the plurality in the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49, 86 ALJR 36, the principle of parity is an illustration of ""equal justice"".  On that issue their Honours said:
""28 ... [Equal justice] applies to the interpretation of statutes and thereby to the exercise of statutory powers. It requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike.  Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen:
""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect."" 
Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is ""a reflection of the notion of equal justice"" and ""is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice"". It finds expression in the ""parity principle"" which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of ""equal justice"", which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.""
80Findings were made in respect of Ms Leota-Lu after a hearing in which she was represented as was the Crown.  Evidence was given and the findings made by English DCJ were based on that evidence.  The sentence imposed by her Honour was based on those findings.  In order to determine whether the parity principle applies, it is necessary to not only consider the factual background to the offences and the charges which were brought against the applicant and Ms Leota-Lu, but to also have regard to the findings made in each case by the sentencing judge.  It does not involve a process by the later sentencing judge or this Court of going behind the findings to assess whether, and if so to what extent, those findings were available.
81The practical difficulties in such an exercise are substantial.  It would involve the later sentencing hearing becoming a de facto appeal with respect to the earlier sentencing hearing.  It would involve an analysis of all of the evidence and submissions in that earlier hearing.  That exercise would take place without there necessarily being any contradictor in respect of the findings made in the earlier sentencing proceedings.  The exercise becomes even more artificial if oral evidence was given in the earlier proceedings and, as happened here, credit findings were made by the first sentencing judge.  There are other practical difficulties, but it is not necessary to enumerate them further.  Suffice it to say that there are sound reasons why such an approach in relation to the principle of parity has not previously been adopted.
82I would reject that preliminary submission.
83Apart from the sentence imposed by his Honour, the other bases for the applicant's ""justifiable sense of grievance"" are:
(i) That Ms Leota-Lu could have been charged with the same offences as the applicant.
(ii) There was a failure by the Crown to properly cross-examine and challenge Ms Leota-Lu in her sentence hearing, which in turn led to a failure on the part of the sentencing judge to properly assess her culpability for the offences she committed with the applicant.
84I have already dealt with the second of those propositions.  While the applicant may well have a sense of grievance in relation to how the Crown case was presented against Ms Leota-Lu, that sense of ""grievance"" is not justified, the test being an objective one (Green at [31]).
85It is the first of those two propositions which was substantially developed by the applicant in his written submissions and in argument.  Those submissions can be summarised as follows:
(A) There is an inconsistency between Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 and R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234.  The inconsistency was said to be that Jimmy held that ""one cannot go behind the exercise of a prosecutorial discretion to examine parity of treatment in regard to co-offenders who, although charged with different offences, are at least broadly equivalent in culpability"".  It was submitted that Kerr held that the whole of the circumstances leading to disparity needed to be examined and that the policy behind the parity principle could not be avoided by a prosecutor laying different charges.
(B) The exercise of the Director of Public Prosecutions' discretion is now based on statute, not prerogative and should be amenable to judicial review in the same way as any other administrative decision.  Thus the prosecutorial discretion should no longer count as a factor weighing in favour of the position in Jimmy.
(C) The High Court's emphasis in Green on substance rather than form favours the approach in Kerr rather than that in Jimmy.
(D) Comments to the contrary in Green at [30] are not binding on intermediate appellate courts because they were not ""closely considered dicta"" (Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89).
86In order to better understand the applicant's submissions, the relevant paragraph of the judgment of the plurality in Green needs to be set out:
""30 In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v the Queen, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""
87Interesting though the issues raised by the applicant may be, and while I am of the view that the applicant's submission involves a misreading of par [30] of Green, there is another more basal difficulty confronting the applicant.  It is this.  The parity principle simply does not arise.  This is not an appropriate case in which to consider the issues raised by the applicant.
88A fundamental difference between the position of Ms Leota-Lu and the applicant is that he went to trial in relation to four of the offences for which he was sentenced, whereas she pleaded guilty to her offences and agreed to provide assistance to the authorities.  She thereby became entitled to a 40 percent discount in her sentences.  When one has regard to that discount, the start point for the aggregate sentence imposed on Ms Leota-Lu was a head sentence of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months.  Given the difference in the offences with which they were charged, a comparison of that sentence with the sentence imposed on the applicant does not indicate a significant disparity.
89When one then takes into account the findings of Judge English that Ms Leota-Lu was acting under duress in relation to the Blaxland offence, and that her culpability in relation to both the Blaxland and Cabarita offences was less than that of the applicant, and that psychologically she was a vulnerable person, the basis for the difference in sentences becomes obvious.
90Even without taking into account the findings in favour of Ms Leota-Lu by Judge English, the objective circumstances of the offences would inevitably involve greater culpability on the part of the applicant.  He was the active party at Blaxland while Ms Leota-Lu sat in the car.  He was the person who made the threats with the knife at Blaxland.  At Cabarita, he was the person with the knife who slashed Mr Addison and who subsequently punched Mrs Addison so severely that he broke her nose.  
91Apart from the fact that the applicant was charged with significantly more serious offences than Ms Leota-Lu which carried larger maximum penalties, he was also sentenced for a serious offence which did not involve Ms Leota-Lu.  That offence was the armed robbery at Werrington to which was attached the carjacking offence by way of a Form 1.  There are accordingly quite significant factual and circumstantial differences between the criminality of the applicant and that of Ms Leota-Lu.
92Once one takes into account those matters together with the discounts which Ms Leota-Lu received, and keeping in mind that the test for a justifiable sense of grievance is an objective one, there is simply no basis for the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance.  That being so, there is no basis for the application of the parity principle.
93While the questions posed by the applicant in his submissions are interesting, they are moot and do not arise on the facts of this case.
94The genesis of the applicant's sense of grievance is that Ms Leota-Lu and he were sentenced by different judges.  This Court and other appellate courts have, on a number of occasions, emphasised the benefits which accrue from co-offenders being sentenced by the same judge.  In R v Nguyen, R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238, 205 A Crim R 106 Johnson J, with whom Macfarlan JA and RA Hulme J agreed, said:
""13 Before embarking upon the substance of the appeals, it is appropriate to observe that these cases illustrate the strong desirability of sentencing proceedings concerning co-offenders going ahead before the same Judge, and preferably at the same time.
14 Separate hearings resulted before different Judges because application for an adjournment was made on 16 October 2009 by counsel for Ms Pham.
...  
19 The practical consequences of the separation of the proceedings included the making of submissions by counsel for the co-offenders that the other offender had, in some respects, played a more significant part in the enterprise.  It was left to the two sentencing Judges, following separate hearings, to make findings upon the basis of the evidence before that Judge.  
20 It is, at the least, highly desirable that co-offenders appear for sentence before the same Judge, preferably at the same time.  This is especially so when submissions may be made on behalf of one offender which seek to compare and contrast the role of that offender as against the co-offender, as an issue bearing upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the relevant offences.  
21 These observations are not intended to serve as criticism of the sentencing Judges in these cases.  Their Honours proceeded to hear and determine the matters on the appointed hearing dates.  Counsel for the relevant parties did not urge the Court to proceed only by way of a joint hearing of the sentencing proceedings before the same Judge.""
95In Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 Johnson J, with whom Whealy JA and Hidden J agreed) said on the same subject:
""32 It will be apparent from what has been said so far that each of the Applicant Dwayhi, the Applicant Bechara and Kertebani came before different sentencing Judges. The Applicant Dwayhi was sentenced in 2008. The Applicant Bechara was convicted after trial before a different Judge in 2009.  Kertebani pleaded guilty before yet another Judge and was sentenced in 2010. 

33 Different courts have emphasised the desirability of related offenders appearing for sentence at the same time before the same Judge, and the problems which may arise where that practice is not followed. 

34 In Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606, Brennan J said at 617 that to ""facilitate the comparison of conduct and antecedents it is desirable that, where practicable, co-offenders be sentenced by the same judge at the same time"" . 

35 In Postiglione v The Queen , Gummow J, at 320, referred to Brennan J's comment and, after mentioning the facts, observed that: 

""... this appeal does more than illustrate the problem that can arise in applying the parity principle to co-offenders where they are sentenced by different judges taking different views as to the relevant culpability of the two offenders in respect of those offences"".

36 Dawson J said in Lowe v The Queen at 622: 

""No explanation was given to us or, apparently, to the Court of Criminal Appeal of the reason why the applicant and Smith entered their pleas before different judges at different times. The result was that, although they were co-offenders, they fell to be sentenced by different judges. Such a situation always carries with it a risk that there will be an unwarranted disparity between the sentences imposed and is to be avoided if at all possible. If it cannot be avoided, then at least the judge imposing the later sentence should inform himself of the sentence already imposed and the circumstances in which it was imposed. I hasten to say that Thomas J was so informed in this case.""
37 In R v Mercieca [2004] VSCA 170, Winneke P observed at [6] that the sentencing of co-offenders by different judges ""creates the potential for differing views being taken by different judges of sentencing facts which are common to all co-offenders"" . 

38 In R v Rodden [2005] VSCA 24, Vincent JA, at [28], stated succinctly the problems arising in this context: 

""Of course, it would have been more satisfactory if all of the persons involved in this matter had been tried and/or sentenced at the same time, and certainly by the same judge. This case demonstrates the kinds of tensions that can appear to arise in the criminal justice system when this does not occur. When a situation arises in which co-offenders are dealt with separately, there may and often are differences in the substratum of facts upon which the different sentencing judges act and the impressions formed by them with respect to the relative roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation of the individuals involved. This, of course, would flow, in part, from the different emphases which can be expected to be placed on aspects of the offending behaviour and the circumstances of the offenders concerned.""
...
44 It is necessary for sentencing Courts and prosecutorial bodies to take steps to ensure, so far as it is reasonably possible, that related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge, and preferably at the same time following a single sentencing hearing. To reinforce this message, creation of relevant Practice Notes (by the Courts) and amendment to prosecution guidelines (by the Commonwealth and New South Wales Directors of Public Prosecutions) may be considered appropriate to give effect to the statements of Courts referred to above.
45 It ought be appropriate, as well, for sentencing and appellate courts to enquire of counsel for an offender, who seeks to rely upon the parity principle, as to the steps taken by that offender or his legal representatives to ensure that he or she was sentenced by the same Judge, and at the same time, as any related offender, if the case is one where there were different sentencing judges.""
96This Court is, of course, sympathetic to the pressures affecting sentencing judges.  What is preferable may not always be possible.  Listing arrangements have to have regard to the availability of particular judges, illness and the need for sentencing proceedings to be expeditiously dealt with.  Nevertheless, the issues which were sought to be raised in this case and which have certainly arisen in other cases involving the parity principle, would occur much less frequently if greater efforts were made to have co-offenders sentenced by the same judge and where appropriate, at the same time.
97For the above reasons, I have concluded that Armitage DCJ was not obliged to apply the parity principle by reference to the sentences imposed on Ms Leota-Lu.  There were important distinguishing features between the criminal responsibility of Ms Leota-Lu and that of the applicant.  This is apart from the fact that the applicant was charged with more serious offences, including one serious offence with which Ms Leota-Lu had no involvement.  In all the circumstances, there was no basis for the applicant having a justified sense of grievance.
98I would grant leave to appeal to the applicant, but I would dismiss the appeal.
99I propose the following orders:
(a) Crown appeal dismissed.(b) Grant leave to appeal to the applicant but dismiss the appeal.
100McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
101JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben JA.

2708022,JT v R [2012] NSWCCA 133,"Judgment

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: JT seeks leave to appeal the sentences imposed upon him by the District Court on 19 September 2008 and 6 March 2009. If leave be granted, JT (hereinafter the appellant) appeals the sentences.

3The appellant was sentenced on 19 September 2008 for 10 offences and on 6 March 2009 he was sentenced for a further offence, which was omitted from the earlier sentencing process.

4The appellant was charged under the Crimes Act 1900 with the following offences:
Counts 1 and 11: malicious wounding, said to have occurred on 16 April 2000 and 29 September 2000 respectively; the maximum penalty for which is 7 years imprisonment;

Count 2: sexual intercourse without consent, said to have occurred on 16 April 2000; the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 14 years;

Count 3: assault occasioning actual bodily harm, said to have occurred on 12 May 2000; the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 5 years;

Counts 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 12: aggravated sexual assault without consent, said to have occurred variously between 1 May and 31 May 2000, and on 18 May 2000, 21 August 2000 and 25 December 2000; the maximum penalty for each being imprisonment for 20 years;

Count 7: maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, said to have been committed on 25 June 2000; the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for seven years.

5Following a trial in the District Court, a jury found the appellant not guilty in relation to Count 3 and guilty of all other charges. The sentencing judge imposed the following sentences:
Count 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years, commencing 19 May 2005;

Count 2: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 5 years, commencing 19 May 2006;

Count 7: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years, commencing 19 May 2007;

Count 11: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years, commencing on 19 November 2007;

Count 12: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 years, commencing 19 May 2008;

Counts 5 and 6: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 years, commencing 19 May 2010;

Counts 8, 9 and 10: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 9 years and a head sentence of 12 years, commencing 19 May 2012;

Count 4: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 years and a head sentence of 14 years, commencing 19 May 2015.

The overall sentence was a head sentence of 24 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 18 years. The non-parole period expires on 18 May 2023.

Extension of time

6The appellant filed a notice of appeal approximately 3 years after the sentence was pronounced and seeks an extension of time.

7The Crown opposes the application for an extension of time. Notwithstanding that opposition and the undue delay in the filing of the appeal, the Crown suffers no particular prejudice; a significant sentence has been imposed upon the appellant, which is still being served, with some years remaining.

8In these circumstances, the appellant ought to have the right to press his appeal and the extension of time should be granted until the date of the filing of the appeal, namely, 29 September 2011.

Facts and sentencing proceedings

9The following is a summary of the sentencing judge's recital of the facts. 

10In October 1999, Larnie Brennan (also referred to as the complainant), who was then eighteen years of age, formed a relationship with the appellant. They began living together in La Perouse.

11On 16 April 2000, the complainant and the appellant were having a few drinks. They ended up in an argument and the appellant attacked the complainant with an iron bar, by hitting her across the forehead with it. She was taken to the Prince of Wales Hospital and treated for the injury. This incident is count 1.

12The second count occurred on the same day, after the complainant returned from hospital. The complainant went to bed and pretended to go to sleep. The appellant pulled down her pants and inserted a VO5 mousse bottle into her vagina, she jumped out of bed and the appellant left. 

13Sometime in May 2000, the appellant and the complainant were drinking in the lounge room at their premises. They started to argue and the appellant came at the complainant with a wood chisel. The appellant started to stab her shoulders, arms and upper body with the chisel. Simultaneously, he was stabbing her with a metal dinner fork. He then took hold of a little wooden baseball bat and started hitting Ms Brennan on the vagina. The appellant pinned the complainant down on the ground and penetrated her vagina with his penis. Ms Brennan was screaming as this occurred, but the appellant's response was to tell her to ""shut up"" saying he could do anything he wanted to her because she was ""his woman"". This incident is count 4. 

14On 18 May 2000, the complainant and the appellant were drinking when the appellant bashed her with a baseball bat. She said he ""chucked"" her on the bed in the front room, was hitting her and told her to take her clothes off. After that he effected penile penetration of her vagina. This was count 5.

15Count 6 occurred immediately after count 5. The appellant turned Ms Brennan on to her stomach, continued to hit her with the baseball bat on her back and effected penile penetration anally. 

16Count 7 occurred on 25 June 2000, when the appellant and the complainant argued. The complainant left the house and the appellant chased her to the front of the building where he began choking her. He dragged her to a block of flats next door, where he pinned her up against the wall and punched her all over her face. Her jaw was broken as a result.

17Count 8 occurred on 21 August 2000. The complainant and appellant argued and the appellant hit her with the same iron bar that he had used previously. This time he hit her in the left eye and told her to get into the caravan. Once in there he told her to get on to the bed where he pulled her pants down and performed oral sex on her. 

18Count 9 occurred on this same date immediately after the offence that is count 8. The appellant still had the iron bar in his hand and jumped up, pulled down his pants and said, ""Suck me cock"". She complied, as a result of the previous assault.

19Count 10 occurred immediately after count 9. The appellant told Ms Brennan to take off her clothes because, he said, he wanted sex and the complainant refused. She said: ""Fuck off, I don't want you near me"", to which he replied: ""Shut up you mole, and I can do whatever I want"". After this, he raped her by penile penetration of the vagina. 

20On 29 September 2000, Ms Brennan was preparing to go to a birthday party. She walked into her lounge room, as she was about to leave, and the appellant informed her that she was not going anywhere. The appellant broke a ceramic plate, on the corner of the lounge and used one part of it to slice Ms Brennan's left thigh. The appellant then remarked: ""You won't be walking nowhere now [sic]"". Ms Brennan was taken to hospital, but lied about her injury. She still has a significant scar as a result of this incident. This was count 11.

21Count 12 occurred on Christmas Day, 2000. The appellant attacked the complainant with a hammer and began hitting her. He dragged her inside their house. Ms Brennan was refusing sexual demands in response to which the appellant pulled out the little baseball bat he had previously used and a golf club. The appellant began hitting her all over the body with these instruments. He put an orange extension cord around her throat before raping her (penile penetration of the vagina) while simultaneously choking her with the cord and hitting her with the hammer. 

22Before the learned sentencing judge, understandably, the appellant conceded, through his counsel, that full-time imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty for each of the subject offences. Each offence was committed at a time when the appellant was subject to conditional liberty, being either a recognizance, or parole.

23The appellant had a pre-existing significant criminal history including offences of violence. Nevertheless, the appellant, at sentencing, relied upon a report of Dr Lennings to submit that a lighter sentence should be imposed because of the appellant's disabilities to which Dr Lennings referred and the consequential effect those disabilities would have, namely, by increasing the onerous nature of custody for the appellant. 

24It was submitted to the sentencing judge that the appellant had less moral culpability and that, therefore, less weight ought to be given to general deterrence. Further, it was submitted that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

25The appellant's counsel at sentencing relied, necessarily, on the principle of totality and the necessity of the sentencing judge to avoid double punishment. The appellant did not rely upon the principles in R v Fernando (1996) 76 A Crim R 88.

26Nevertheless, Dr Lennings referred to the appellant as part of the Aboriginal community in the course of his thorough report. The appellant was 30 years of age at the time that Dr Lennings dealt with him. The report said, in part:

""[JT] has been found guilty of a number of violent and sexually violent crimes. The fact that he continues to protest his innocence at one level makes the assessment of risk somewhat more difficult as he clearly does not accept the charges that have been made against him. In relation to violent risk I note that his criminal record indicates a number of other violent offences both involved in company and usually involved with some form of significant substance abuse. It seems that his risk of violence relates to both his lack of inhibition against violence as well as the additional disinhibiting affects of substances and peers that approve of or help model aggressive behaviours. Nonetheless he has also revealed considerable impulse energy in his background and a poor capacity to deal with rules and a poor attitude towards authority. I note that on occasion he has not been able to comply with parole conditions and it seems that when left to himself he has been unable to formulate appropriate ways of being able to manage. Clearly any reduction in his risk of violence would depend not only upon whether or not he attended anger management courses but the extent to which he is able to avail himself of case management services in the community that are going to help him develop the kind of life management skills that he will require.

In regards to this risk of sexual violence it would appear that [JT]'s charges occurred in the context of a dysfunctional [relationship] and there is no indication of risk in relation to strangers or to children. On formal risk assessment [JT]'s list level is moderately high. It appears that the sexual violence was a function of the aggression and anger and dysfunction generally within that relationship and it is probably best seen as an outgrowth of anger and dysfunctional relationship behaviours than sexual deviance per se. Nonetheless the description of the offences presents a person whose lack of remorse and consideration of another indicates a high need for victim empathy training. As he continues to deny his offences I am unsure as to whether he will be able to find treatment services for sexual offending behaviour in gaol.""

27In cross-examination, Dr Lennings clarified that the moderately high-risk assessment to which the above report refers was a reference to the risk of further sexual re-offending. In contrast, Dr Lennings' evidence was to the effect that ""the assessment of risk of violence [simpliciter] would fall into the high range"", as distinct from the moderately high range.

28The foregoing recitation of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences of which the appellant was found guilty disclose offences involving significant violence, and little regard or sensitivity for the harm being perpetrated to others, particularly women who are in a relationship with the appellant. The sentencing judge (and Dr Lennings) remarked that the appellant displayed little, if any, remorse.

29The appellant raises eight grounds of appeal, which are:

(1) The sentences imposed were unduly harsh and severe;

(2) The sentencing judge erred in making insufficient allowance for totality;

(3) The sentencing judge erred in [the] application of the principles of Veen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465;

(4) The sentencing judge erred in respect to the [use of] the [appellant's] prior criminal record;

(5) The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account intoxication;

(6) The sentencing judge erred in failing to apply the principles in Fernando;

(7) The sentencing judge erred in making no allowance for delay;

(8) The sentencing judge erred in respect to special circumstances.
 

Submissions of the parties

The sentences imposed were unduly harsh and severe

30The appellant submits that the sentence imposed is on par with, and higher than, some sentences for murder. It is further submitted that the individual sentences imposed were at the top of, or very close to the top of, comparative sentences as demonstrated by JIRS statistics. 

31The Crown submits, in this regard, that the sentences were within the range, given the nature of the offences committed and that sentencing statistics are of limited use: see Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45. 

The sentencing judge erred in making insufficient allowance for totality 

32The appellant concedes that the effect of the sentences was partially ameliorated, through partial accumulation. However, the appellant submits that the sentencing judge failed to take into account sufficiently the individual and total lengths of the sentences and reduce them accordingly.

33The Crown submits that the manner and extent to which the sentencing judge accumulated the sentences was a matter for his discretionary judgment: R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115.

The sentencing judge erred in the application of the principles of Veen (No 2)

34The appellant submits that the sentencing judge's remarks indicate that he incorrectly applied Veen (No 2) as a basis for imposing preventative detention. 

35In addition, the appellant submits that his Honour made findings regarding the ongoing dangerousness of the appellant, which were unjustified. 

36The Crown submits that his Honour acknowledged, twice, that it was impermissible to increase the appellant's sentence on the basis that his Honour would have otherwise imposed an increased sentence by reason of preventative detention, if that was available to his Honour. The Crown submits that the sentencing judge's approach was in accordance with authority: Veen (No 2). 

The sentencing judge erred in respect to the appellant's prior criminal record

37The appellant submits that the sentencing judge's reference to the appellant's ""terrible record"" was incorrectly taken into account as an aggravating factor: per R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.

38The Crown submits that the fact that the appellant was subject to conditional liberty and had a relevant record, or previous conditions, were conceded as ""aggravating factors"" by counsel for the appellant in the Court below. 

The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account intoxication

39The appellant submits that the sentencing judge made no reference to the appellant's alcohol and drug problem as an explanation as to how the offences came to be committed or in relation to the aspect of impulsivity. 

40Again, the Crown submits that counsel for the appellant conceded at trial that the appellant's voluntary consumption of alcohol did not of itself amount to a mitigating circumstance.

The sentencing judge erred in failing to apply the principles in Fernando

41The applicant submits that the sentencing judge made no reference to the appellant's Aboriginality or to the principles set out in Fernando. In R v Timbery [1996] NSWCCA 1, this Court found these principles applied to the appellant. 

42The Crown relies on the fact that counsel for the appellant at sentencing proceedings did not seek to rely upon the principles in Fernando. The Crown submits that the fact that Fernando principles had in the past been found to apply to the appellant, does not automatically warrant the same finding in the present case given the continued pattern of serious offending by the applicant: R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202. 

The sentencing judge erred in making no allowance for delay 

43The sentencing judge expressly rejected any reduction of sentence on the basis of delay. The appellant submits that his Honour's reasons for rejecting a reduction based on delay disclose error. 

44The onus of establishing this matter was on the appellant: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. The Crown submits that there was no evidence, or submission, before his Honour to suggest the delay had a negative impact upon the appellant. 

The sentencing judge erred in respect to special circumstances

45The appellant submits the overall non-parole period does not reflect any diminution of the ordinary statutory ration of 3:1, indicating a failure to apply the principle that accumulation of sentences may constitute special circumstances. 

46The Crown submits that the sentencing judge gave careful consideration to the thought and structure of the sentences and the principle of totality. In addition, the Crown submits that his Honour found special circumstances for the most serious offence, as the statutory ratio was reduced to approximately 57 percent for that offence.

47In addition, the appellant submits that the onerous nature of custody in protection was not considered by his Honour as a relevant special circumstance. 

48The Crown submits that the sentencing judge dealt with the issue of the applicant being on protection. Having taken the matter into account, his Honour was not necessarily obliged to vary the statutory ratio: R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253. 

Consideration

49For obvious reasons, the grounds of appeal overlap, as do some of the offences. I will deal with them under general headings.

Fernando

50I deal firstly with the submission that the sentencing judge failed to apply the principles in Fernando. The evidence before the sentencing judge, in Fernando, was that the appellant came from a dysfunctional background, in which forceful behaviour and abuse had been part of his upbringing. Ordinarily, such a background would give rise to the application of the principles in Fernando. The appellant gained the benefit of such principles on an earlier occasion.

51In this matter, the sentencing judge found, as fact, that the appellant came from a supportive environment, with no suggestion that the family in which he was raised experienced problems with either alcohol or domestic violence (Remarks on Sentence, page 5). There is evidence upon which this finding could have been made: see exhibit 2.1 and pre-sentence report, at page 2. Similar comments were found in other psychiatric and/or psychological reports.

52Notwithstanding what seems to be implied in the Crown's submission, there is no limit to the number of times upon which the principles in Fernando may be applied, if they remain appropriate. 

53There may come an occasion where consideration of principles that go broader than those adumbrated in Fernando is appropriate. There are many psychological studies that provide much evidence to suggest that acts of discrimination, disempowerment and exclusion, which have been suffered by members of the Aboriginal community, have directly caused certain behaviour, as opposed to certain behaviour being caused by a history of abuse. Of course, this principle may apply to other groups of people, but it applies quintessentially to the Aboriginal community.

54This is not the case for consideration of such a principle. In this case, with full instructions, counsel at the sentencing hearing did not raise the Fernando principles before the sentencing judge. No broader sentencing principle is or was suggested. In those circumstances, considerations arise of the kind to which Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules are directed.

55In my view, the appellant ought not now be permitted to appeal on a basis that could have been, but was not, addressed below; in circumstances where the factual basis (or lack of it) was well known to counsel who appeared below, to the Crown and to the sentencing judge. It would require a challenge to a finding of fact by the sentencing judge, which finding was available to him. No such challenge has been made. Leave to raise this ground should be refused.

Delay

56Next, I deal with the allegation that allowance was made for delay. The sentencing judge acknowledged that the appellant was a much younger man at the time he committed the offences than at the time of sentencing (Remarks on Sentence, page 10). His Honour remarked:

""Not much can really be made of the delay in this case. There is little to suggest that the offender spent the period between the commission of his offences and his arrest worrying about whether he would ultimately be dealt with for his wrongdoing. Nor has the offender been able to demonstrate any rehabilitation since he committed these serious offences. Indeed his failure to admit them suggests that he has not changed much, if at all.""

57It is noteworthy that the sentencing judge did not say that nothing could be made of the delay, but used the words ""not much"". There was no evidence before the Court, at sentencing or on appeal, which suggested the delay had some particular effect and there is no suggestion that the offences were stale. In the circumstances, it was open to his Honour to find that the delay in the present case afforded minimal weight as a means of mitigating the sentence to be imposed.

Intoxication

58Again, his Honour specifically acknowledged that the appellant had been consuming large quantities of alcohol and illegal drugs at the time of the offences. This consumption was voluntary and was the subject of a concession by counsel at the sentencing hearing that it could not, of itself, amount to a mitigating circumstance.

59It was difficult for the appellant to rely on intoxication being the reason for him ""acting out of character "", because the appellant continued to maintain that he had not committed the offences of which he was found guilty.

60Given the length of time over which these offences occurred and his Honour's finding that the offences were motived by a desire to control, abuse and humiliate the complainant, intoxication would not have been an issue that significantly affected the sentence to be imposed.

Use of prior criminal record and preventative detention

61The sentencing judge, at page 9 of his Remarks on Sentence, said:

""It is of course legitimate for a sentencing judge to take into account the need to protect the community when imposing a sentence upon an offender. What is not permitted is a sentence, which is extended beyond that which would otherwise be appropriate in order to give effect to the desire for preventative detention.

I am not going to mince words here. Given the offender's history of violence and given Dr Lennings' assessment of the probability of future violence is my confident prediction that once released from custody the offender will harm someone else through a further offence of violence in a serious way.

The two cases of Veen v The Queen (No 1) (1979) 143 CLR 458 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 set out quite clearly the proper approach to preventative detention and the circumstances of the offences of Mr Veen demonstrate why it is that preventative detention can and should, in appropriate cases, be an important factor in determining an appropriate sentence. I repeat I will not extend the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon the offender, extension by reason of preventative detention is impermissible but in exercising my sentencing discretion I will have regard to the protection of society, among other factors of course.""

62Unless this Court were prepared to assume that his Honour has deliberately misstated his approach, it could not find that his Honour has extended the sentence otherwise to be imposed upon the appellant by reason of preventative detention. This Court is not prepared to assume that his Honour meant anything other than that which he has expressed.

63The sentencing judge may have used slightly infelicitous terminology, but the above passage makes clear that his Honour was taking into account protection of society as a factor in sentencing, but was not allowing himself to extend the sentence in order to implement any form of preventative detention.

64His Honour noted, and counsel for the appellant conceded, at the sentencing hearing, that all of the offences were committed while the appellant was on conditional liberty. That fact, together with the appellant's record of serious violent offences, denied the appellant any leniency associated with first offences and disclosed that specific deterrence and punishment should be given greater weight and rehabilitation lesser weight than would otherwise be the situation. In those respects, his Honour has not displayed any error of law, error of principle or mistake of fact such that would allow this Court to intervene in the exercise of discretion in which he was engaged.

The sentences were unduly harsh and severe and did not sufficiently apply the principle of totality

65The first ground of appeal, which alleges undue harshness and severity in the sentence, necessarily involves much of the same considerations as totality. Moreover, this ground would not stand, at least in its current form, were the sentence to be reduced because of grounds associated with the application of Veen (No 2) and other grounds, which, if successful, would reduce the sentence imposed. It is for that reason, amongst others, that these grounds of appeal have been dealt with after the earlier grounds in these reasons.

66As already stated, these offences were extremely serious. The appellant abused his position with the complainant and used his access to the complainant to mete out significant violence, including sexual abuse. The appellant submits, ""The total sentence imposed was a crushing one. It is on par with and higher than some sentences for murder.""

67That submission compares an overall sentence imposed for 11 offences - each of which is serious although some are part of the one course of conduct - with a sentence imposed for one offence of murder. Such a comparison is inappropriate.

68In the conduct of the appellant, counts 1 and 2 arise out of the same course of conduct; counts 5 and 6 arise out of the same course of conduct; and counts 8, 9 and 10 arise from the same course of conduct. Each of the foregoing courses of conduct is separate from the other and, in turn, each is separate from the courses of conduct involved in counts 4, 7, 11 and 12.

69When a sentencing judge is called upon to impose a sentence involving two or more offences that involve common elements, the sentencing judge is required to ensure that no double punishment occurs for the one offending course of conduct: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40]. That task involves the Court approaching the matter as a matter of common sense and identifying whether a single act was an element of each offence for which the sentence is being imposed: Pearce at [42].

70Where the sentencing judge is required to impose a sentence for more than one offence, involving disparate conduct, the sentencing judge must impose an appropriate sentence for each separate offence, after which questions of accumulation and concurrence should be considered. That consideration involves a determination of the appropriate totality of the overall sentence to be imposed: Pearce at [45].

71The exercise involved in determining accumulation and concurrence and the application of the principles of totality are inconsistent with the proposition that one single correct answer will be derived in every circumstance by every judge. The application of the principle of totality is an exercise of discretion, intuitive or instinctive synthesis, and cannot be conducted arithmetically: Pearce at [46]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. The principle assumes that each individual sentence imposed will reflect the criminality of that offence and that the combination of the sentences shall reflect the total criminality of all of the crimes committed: Pearce.

72The sentencing exercise carried out by the sentencing judge, in this case, was complicated. As one would expect of an experienced sentencing judge, his Honour imposed a sentencing regime that reflected that complexity. His Honour initially imposed commencement dates, for subsequent offences, 12 months after the earlier sentence and two years and three years after for the more serious offences. The sentence imposed for count 11 was imposed on 6 March 2009, after each of the other sentences had been imposed and interrupted that pattern, but made no difference to the overall sentence imposed.

73Generally, in the application of the principle of totality, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a sentencing judge to do more than state and apply the principle on the facts as found. Greater transparency is extremely difficult. The process is at the essence of intuitive or instinctive synthesis. As a consequence, once a sentencing judge notes that the principle is being applied (or plainly, by an examination of the process involved, has applied the principle), assuming the facts are correctly stated, in order for an appeal court to intervene, the result must manifest an incorrect application of the principle. Otherwise, interference with the result is impermissible.

74The result of the exercise of discretion of the sentencing judge in this matter may be the imposition of a heavier sentence than another judge would impose, but it is not manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the offences and the circumstances of the offender. The principle of totality has been applied and no error is disclosed.

75A significant amount of concurrence is involved in the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge. A number of them are wholly concurrent. Others added as little as six or 12 months to the overall sentence imposed.

76Each of the sentences is a significant sentence, but none of them represents more than approximately 60 percent of the maximum sentence available for that offence. One cannot be arithmetical in the approach. There is no suggestion in the sentences that there was an abuse of the application of any standard non-parole period, because none was applicable to the sentences imposed. These are heavy sentences. When they are added together it is a heavy overall sentence. But it is a heavy overall sentence for 11 offences, each of which is serious.

77In those circumstances, statistics are of even less use than might otherwise have been the case. The strict use of statistics is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Such statistics are useful for the purpose of showing a trend in the sentences that have been imposed, but each sentence must be imposed on the basis of the sentencing principles and not on the basis of an adherence to statistical averages: Hili and Jones v The Queen at [54].

78These were sentences imposed after pleas of not guilty and in circumstances where little or no remorse has been displayed. The statistics are generally unhelpful because of the small sample involved.

79Ultimately the manner in which the sentencing judge has accumulated the sentences was a matter within his discretion and the discretion has not miscarried: R v XX at [52].

Special Circumstances

80Lastly, I deal with the appellant's reliance on the failure to find special circumstances. This submission is misconceived.

81In R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58, Hunt CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) (with whom Grove and Sharpe JJ agreed), and in many cases since, the Court made clear that the accumulation of sentences may itself warrant the finding of special circumstances so that a sentencing court ""can ensure a proper proportion between the total minimum term and the effective additional term"" (at 61).

82The principle requires an appropriate period of parole in an overall sentence. Where, in sentencing for a number of offences, the sentence for each offence reflects an application of a ratio between non-parole period and the remainder of the term that is not reflected in the overall sentence, then a question arises as to whether there has been consideration of the effect of accumulation.

83It is the effect of accumulation itself that gives rise to a reason, without more, to apply a different ratio than that prescribed by the statute. To use a simple example, assume a sentencing judge imposes two sentences of 4 years' imprisonment, with a 3year non-parole period. If the sentences were imposed wholly concurrently, no issue arises. Once the sentences are imposed with some accumulation, or wholly consecutively, the ratio necessarily alters. 

84If, in the above example, the sentences imposed were to be served consecutively (i.e. the second sentence to be served immediately following the expiry of the non-parole period of the first sentence), then the overall sentence would be a non-parole period of 6 years, with an additional term of 12 months; a ratio of 6:1, compared with the statutory ratio of 3:1. Any lesser degree of accumulation will lessen, but not eliminate the effect on the overall ratio. 

85In order to overcome that effect, the last sentence imposed requires a ratio that results in an overall ratio that the sentencing judge considers appropriate. Here, the sentencing judge has done just that. The last sentence imposed on the appellant has a ratio between non-parole period and remainder of term of 4:3. This was calculated, clearly, in order to effect a ratio in the overall sentence of 3:1 (i.e. 18 years: 6 years).

86His Honour expressly took account of the harsher conditions that may be experienced during incarceration in fixing the sentences to be imposed. Otherwise, the finding of special circumstances is within the discretion of the judge. No error has been disclosed on this account.
 

Conclusion

87For the foregoing reasons, the discretion exercised by the sentencing judge has not miscarried. Sentencing is an exercise of discretion that may be interfered with only on one of the well-known bases that derive from the statement of principle in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, being that the judge acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide the exercise, has mistaken the facts, or has not taken into account some material consideration (at 504-505).

88None of the grounds of appeal established error of that kind. It is not sufficient in order to succeed on appeal that a judge on appeal may be of the view that she or he would have taken a different course than the sentencing judge.

89I would grant leave to appeal, but I would dismiss the appeal. I propose the following orders:

(1) Extension of time granted that is sufficient to allow for the filing of the appeal;

(2) Leave to appeal granted, except as to Ground 6 for which leave is refused;

(3) Appeal dismissed.

2708023,Muhammad Jehangir KHAN v R [2012] NSWCCA 132,"Judgment
1MEAGHER JA: I agree with Rothman J that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed for the reasons which he gives.
2HOEBEN JA: I agree with Rothman J
3ROTHMAN J:  Muhammad Jehangir Khan seeks leave to appeal the sentences imposed upon him by the District Court on 3 February 2011.  Mr Khan pleaded guilty to seven charges and was sentenced to an overall sentence of three years' imprisonment commencing 3 February 2011 and concluding on 2 February 2014, with a total non-parole period of 18 months, concluding on 2 August 2012.
4The overall sentence was comprised of the following sentences:
(1)Counts 1 and 2: Two counts of provide a falsified passport as an identity document, contrary to s 22(2) of the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005 (Cth), carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment or 1000 penalty units or both, for which a sentence was imposed on Mr Khan, for each count, of a fixed term of 10 months' imprisonment commencing 3 April 2011 and expiring 2 February 2012 (wholly concurrent);
(2)Count 3: Possess a false Australian passport, contrary to s 36(1) of the Australian Passports Act 2005 (Cth), carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment or 1000 penalty units or both, for which a sentence was imposed on Mr Khan of a fixed term of 6 months' imprisonment commencing 3 February 2011 and expiring 2 August 2011;
(3)Count 4: Open bank account in a false name, contrary to s 24(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth), carrying a maximum sentence of not more than two years' imprisonment, for which a sentence was imposed on Mr Khan of a fixed term of 3 months' imprisonment commencing 3 February 2011 and expiring 2 May 2011;
(4)Counts 5 and 6: Two counts of use false instrument, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, for which, in relation to each, Mr Khan was sentenced to a non-parole period of eight months commencing 3 December 2011 and concluding 2 August 2012 as part of a head sentence of two years and two months expiring on 2 February 2014 (wholly concurrent sentences);
(5)Count 7: Make a false instrument with intent to obtain a financial advantage, contrary to s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment, for which Mr Khan was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months' imprisonment commencing 3 December 2011 and concluding 2 June 2012.
Pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth), a Schedule of further offences was filed and the sentence on Count1 takes account of four charges on that Schedule.
A further four offences, contained on a Form 1, filed pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, were taken into account in the sentence on Count 5, above.
5One matter, to which neither Counsel referred, is that the records on appeal indicate that Counts 5 and 6, namely using false instruments, were contrary to s 302 of the Crimes Act.  The indictment, which formed the basis of the arraignment of Mr Khan, does not refer to a provision number in the Crimes Act.  The offence is described in words similarly to that recited above, namely, ""use false instrument"".  Such an offence, if committed, is an offence under s 300(2) of the Crimes Act, not s 302.  The maximum sentence is the same for a contravention of s 300(2) and s 302 of the Crimes Act; and otherwise the sentence depends on the circumstances of the offence and the offender.  Mr Khan pleaded guilty to the charges on the indictment.  
6Further, the agreed facts indicate a use of the false instrument had been effected and, if the offence considered by the sentencing judge were a contravention of s 302 of the Crimes Act, then the difficulties associated with the principles in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 would arise: see R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251 at [19].
7It is unlikely that the sentencing judge was under any illusions as to the correct offence.  It is far more likely, because the remarks on sentence would have been taken from transcript, that the sentencing judge's reference to s 300(2) was transcribed as s 302.  Nevertheless, the particulars of trial, filed by the Commonwealth DPP, continue that error.  
8Mr Khan relies on three grounds of appeal:
(i)Disparity with a co-offender Monica Khera;
(ii)Misapplication of the totality principle;
(iii)Manifest excess.
Facts
9As earlier stated, Mr Khan pleaded guilty and agreed facts were tendered before the sentencing judge.  The learned sentencing judge used those agreed facts as the basis upon which he imposed the sentences and summarised those facts in his Remarks on Sentence, as one would expect.  Those agreed facts were in the following terms:
""The Offender was arrested on 12 December 2008 pursuant to a joint Federal and State Identity Security Strike Team (ISST) investigation into a large number of identity fraud offences, called Operation Steerforth. A number of persons have been sentenced for various offences identified during the investigation.
The principal organiser of the syndicate was Shoab Hanif. Hanif's charges are being prosecuted by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions and he is listed for sentence before this Court on 24 June 2010.
Hanif's syndicate was established to manufacture false identities and use those identities to open and operate bank accounts in false names in order to defraud financial institutions. Syndicate members produced false passports and false identification documents such as false tenancy agreements, pay advices and telephone accounts. These documents were used to open bank savings and credit accounts. In a typical case when credit was extended by a financial institution that credit would not be repaid.
Under Hanif, the syndicate head, syndicate members performed different roles including identity manufacturers, keepers of accounts and account information, supervisors who advised others on how to make the fraudulent applications for bank accounts and syndicate members who actually lodged the fraudulent applications.
The offender's role was to open bank accounts and credit accounts with financial institutions in false names by means of presenting false identity documents, including false foreign passports and a false Australian passport bearing his photograph and a signature purporting to be that of the passport holder, and other false documents including Medicare cards, credit cards, payslips and a Telstra phone bill.
Offences Using the False Identity ""Chand Rauf""
On 28 February 2007 the Offender Muhammad Jehangir Khan attended the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at Menai Marketplace and opened a ""Streamline Account"" numbered 233310196317 in the false name of Chand Rauf (s.16BA Offence 3). He presented as a means of identification a false Republic of India passport number A4254126 in the name of Chand Rauf. The passport bore the Offender's photograph and a signature (Indictment Count 2).
Offences Using the False Identity ""Vivek Patwari""
(i) Commonwealth Bank
On 23 March 2007 the Offender attended the Campsie branch of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and opened an account in the false name of Vivek Patwari (s.16BA Offence 2). As part of the application the Offender presented as identification a false Republic of India passport number A1690224 in the name Vivek Patwari. The passport bore the Offender's photograph and a signature. (s16BA Offence 1) The Offender further produced as identification a Medicare card number 2323251763 in the name of Vivek Patwari (Form One Offence 2) and an ANZ Visa card number 4564 6990 0404 6909 in the name of Vivek Patwari (Form One Offence 4).
(ii) Westpac Bank
On 22 May 2007 the Westpac bank received an application for a MasterCard credit card in the name of Vivek Patwari. The application was approved and a credit card issued with a credit limit of $2400.
On 2 July 2007 the Offender attended the Westpac branch at Brookvale NSW representing himself to be Vivek Patwari and opened the account (Indictment Count 4).
The Offender produced identification including a false Republic of India passport number A1690224 in the name of Vivek Patwari bearing his photograph and a signature (Indictment Count 1). The Offender produced as further proof of identification two payslips purportedly issued by the company Blue Eagle Security Service Pty Ltd. The payslips had been falsified (Indictment Count 5). The Offender also produced as identification a genuine ANZ Visa Card issued in the name of Vivek Patwari (Indictment Count 7). Also produced as identification was a Medicare card number 2323251763 in the name of Vivek Patwari (Form One Offence 1).
Offences Using False Identity ""Atul Bukhtayari""
On 7 March 2008 the Offender attended the Penrith branch of the National Australia Bank and opened an account in the false name of Atul Bukhtayari (s16BA Offence 4)
As part of the application the Offender produced as identification a false Australian passport number A7381813 in the name Atul Bukhtayari. The passport bore the Offender's photograph and a signature (Indictment Count 3).
As further identification in support of the application the Offender submitted a false HSBC MasterCard in the name Atul Bukhtayari (Indictment Count 6) and a falsified Telstra telephone bill for account number 0515911328 in the name of Atul Bukhtayari (Form One Offence 3).
As a result of the offences a loss of $2944.00 has been suffered by Westpac Bank, for which it seeks restitution.""
10The sentencing judge also considered Mr Khan's criminal history and a probation and parole service presentence report dated 30 April 2010.  Also tendered were three references for Mr Khan and a psychological report of 14 March 2010, compiled by W. John Taylor, Forensic Psychologist.
11The psychologist's report recites a poor early family environment caused by the death of his father when Mr Khan was in his early teens, which environment existed until Mr Khan came to Australia in February 1998.  He had led quite a stable lifestyle, according to the report, which also recited that Mr Khan had no prior criminal record.  However, in 2001, Mr Khan was convicted of driving while suspended, using an unregistered vehicle and driving an uninsured vehicle for which fines were imposed.  I do not consider these offences as relevant to the exercise of sentencing challenged in this appeal.
12Mr Khan gave evidence before the sentencing judge and was cross-examined.  That cross-examination was effective and other evidence was adduced.  In the course of submissions, the Crown said:
""It is the Crown's case in writing that when your Honour looks at the role that Mr Khan played in these offences, to which he's pleaded guilty, in relation to the statement of facts which sets out in objective terms the general operation of this syndicate, and the roles of different people in it, that Mr Khan, the offender, is one who made fraudulent applications for bank accounts, and lodged fraudulent applications.  That is to say he is at the lower end of the scale of criminality to this ongoing criminal operation.
HIS HONOUR: He certainly wasn't involved in the planning and the organisation at all on the facts, on the evidence.
CROWN: No, no.  Your Honour, it's not the Crown case that to the extent that bank accounts, in this case the Westpac account, was defrauded, if you like, of monies, that the offender received the benefit of that, it appears to be consistent with the operation of the syndicate that having made the application the operation of an account, or a credit account, would then be handed over to those higher above who would take advantage of it.
The Crown does not dispute that Mr Khan initially got involved on the promise of money.  Whether or not he was actually paid any money the Crown cannot say one way or the other, we cannot dispute his evidence about that, your Honour.  The Crown does not dispute that it is quite likely that having lent himself to this criminal behaviour on the first occasion he was then subject to threats and pressure to continue doing so from time to time, or he might be exposed in some way.""  (Transcript, pages 49-50)
13The preferable course, when sentencing co-offenders, is that one judge sentence all of the co-offenders.  Unfortunately, this did not occur in relation to Mr Khan and his co-offenders.  Nevertheless, the sentencing judge was provided with the remarks on sentence for each of Mr Khan's co-offenders.  The sentences imposed on each of the co-offenders were:
NAME OF OFFENDERAGGREGATE NON-PAROLE PERIODAGGREGATE HEAD SENTENCENazife Neha AkramSummary disposal without record of convictionMohammed Akraim CheemaSeven months imprisonment, fully suspended, 12 month good behaviour bond, and 200 hours of community serviceDeepak VermaSummary disposal, without sentence, good behaviour bond to three years, fined $1000Anjali VermaSummary disposal, good behaviour bond for three years and $1000 fineGerard Gonaseelen PadotanFixed term of six months' imprisonmentKamol SodhiSummary disposal; no sentence; 12 month good behaviour bondMonica KheraAggregate 15 months non-paroleAggregate two years and six months in sentenceArun KumarAggregate non-parole period of three years and nine monthsAggregate head sentence of five years and six months
Mohammed AkramOne year three months, fully suspendedMohammed Khan (the applicant)Aggregate non-parole period of 18 monthsAggregate head sentence of three years

Submissions of PartiesManifest Excess
14Mr Khan submits that the objective seriousness of his offending was at the lower end of the range for offences of this nature.  The sentencing judge found that Mr Khan was unlikely to re-offend and the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, particularly given the applicant's criminal history.
15The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions submits that, in order for the sentence to be manifestly excessive, the sentence must be plainly unreasonable and unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325.  The DPP submits that the offences were objectively serious and part of a planned and organised activity.  It involved a number of repeated offences and formed part of a wider scheme of identity fraud and dishonesty.  The DPP relied upon the correctness of the sentencing judge's observation that, for offences of this nature, general deterrence is a very important aspect of the sentencing exercise.  The DPP submits that neither each individual sentence nor the aggregate effective sentence was outside the appropriate range.
16Mr Khan purports to rely on statistics in order to show that the sentence imposed on him was, contrary to the submission of the DPP, outside the range ordinarily associated with these offences.
Totality
17Mr Khan submits that the structure of the sentence imposed upon him does not reveal a logical basis.  For example, the conduct of opening one account with false documentation on one occasion resulted in three sentences; the commencement of each sentence was different.  The applicant submits there is no rational basis for failing to make these sentences wholly concurrent.
18The applicant also submits that the same sentence was imposed for the same charges, notwithstanding that one of them had attached to it further charges to be taken into account.
19Lastly, the applicant points to the longer sentences, commencing last, for the act of presenting a false passport and false MasterCard, which acts, it is said, could not warrant imposition of such a heavy sentence, particularly when an additional penalty was imposed for the production of false passport to open the same account.  Further, the accumulation did not reflect the fact that the offences were essentially for acts of a criminal nature, the last three of which were committed under coercion.
20In response, the DPP submits that, given the nature and number of offences for which Mr Khan was to be sentenced, a degree of accumulation was required in order to reflect the total criminality.  Once it is clear, submits the DPP, that the sentencing judge has found the correct facts and expressly (or impliedly) applied the principle of totality, the degree of accumulation is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge.
21The DPP submits that the structure of the sentences does have a logical and rational basis.  That basis was the imposition of sentences for counts 1, 4, 5 and 7 (all of which concern the false identity of Vivek Patwari) of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months, all other sentences to be served concurrently with the sentences for those counts.
22The DPP submits that his Honour's approach was to deal with the overall criminality involved in each aspect of the transaction related to the fraudulent identity, rather than to group the sentences according to each offence.  Further, the DPP submits there is no error in such an approach.
Lack of parity with Monica Khera
23The applicant, Mr Khan, contends, as one must to succeed on the basis of lack of parity, that he has a justifiable sense of grievance when compared with Monica Khera, who received an overall sentence that was lighter than that imposed on Mr Khan.  She was the wife of Arun Kumar and she pleaded guilty to 13 charges, with two further charges taken into account.
24As is evident from the foregoing table, Ms Khera was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 15 months' non-parole period (compared to Mr Khan's aggregate 18 months' non-parole period) as part of a head sentence of two years and six months (compared to Mr Khan's aggregate head sentence of three years' imprisonment).
25Mr Khan submits that, while his Honour expressly dealt with parity between Mr Khan and Mr Akram during argument on sentence, and was provided by the Crown with submissions as to parity with Arun Kumar, his Honour did not address parity as between Mr Khan and Monica Khera.  Were he to have addressed the issue, Mr Khan submits, his Honour would have been required to impose a sentence on Mr Khan that was less onerous than the sentence imposed on Ms Khera.
26Mr Khan submits that Ms Khera's ""culpability is greater"" and the ""only additional mitigating feature with respect to Ms Khera... was an early plea.""
27The DPP points out that Mr Khan put no submission to the sentencing judge as to appropriate parity and allowed his Honour to fix the relative sentence for Mr Khan, assisted only by the Crown's submission below, that the sentence should be fixed somewhere between that of Mr Akram's and Arun Kumar's sentences.
28The DPP also submits that the ""co-offenders"" are not ""co-offenders in the strict sense"", with each participating in the same overall criminal enterprise, but each also been charged with different offences and a different number of offences, depending on the conduct of the offender.  Further, the DPP contends that there is a rational basis for the difference in treatment of Mr Khan and Ms Khera and that, therefore, Mr Khan can have no grounds for a justifiable sense of grievance for the different sentence imposed on him.
Consideration
Manifest Excess and Totality
29It is necessary, because of the nature of the submissions on these questions, to deal with grounds two and three of the appeal, namely, manifest excess and totality, at the same time.  Generally, Mr Khan criticises the aggregate sentence more than each of the individual sentences imposed.
30At the outset of these reasons, the maximum sentence for each of the offences has been recited.  In terms of individual sentences, the offences charged under Counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 carried maximum prison sentences of 10 years' imprisonment (plus fines), Count 4 carried a prison sentence of not more than two years and Count 7 carried a prison sentence of five years.  In order of commencement date, the structure of the sentence imposed by his Honour was:
Commencement dateConclusion non-parole period (if any)Conclusion head sentenceCount 4 3/2/11N/A2/5/11Count 33/2/11N/A2/8/12Counts 1 & 23/4/11N/A2/2/12Count 73/12/11N/A2/6/12Counts 5 & 63/12/112/8/122/2/14

31As can be seen from the foregoing table, there is significant concurrence of sentences.  Counts 4 and 3 are wholly concurrent and have the effect of adding 2 months to the sentence otherwise imposed for Counts 1 and 2.  Similarly, Counts 1 and 2 add eight months to the sentence imposed for Counts 7, 5 & 6 (which are wholly concurrent).
32In terms of individual sentences, given that the maximum sentence for five of the counts is 10 years' imprisonment, none of the sentences are particularly severe.  However, the setting of a sentence that is appropriate is not a mathematical exercise.  Nor can a sentencing judge assess the appropriateness of a sentence by calculating some percentage of the maximum permitted by the law.
33In order to set an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge must consider the objective seriousness of the offence and the circumstances of the offender.  The purpose in sentencing any offender seeks to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals.  In serious crimes, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large.  These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform.  Each of those factors, particularly personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances viewed objectively within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged.  
34Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but it is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation.  That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation in turn impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender.  There is no single correct sentence and the often complicated interplay of considerations point in different directions. 
35The subjective circumstances of Mr Khan were not especially compelling.  He was 37 years of age, but had no serious prior criminal activity and had a family, including a very young child.  He had suffered serious deprivation that brought him to Australia.  The sentencing judge recited all of the relevant subjective factors, with which facts Mr Khan does not take issue.  I need not repeat them, except to the extent that they are relevant to the submissions on disparity.  His Honour also allowed a 10 percent reduction in the sentence for a late plea (the first indication of the plea of guilty was on the first day of the trial fixed in the District Court).
36Mr Khan initially became involved in the criminal enterprise as a result of a promise of financial reward and the possibility of full-time employment.  After his initial involvement, his involvement was the result of some coercion, being the threat that, unless he continued to assist in the criminal enterprise, he would be reported to the police.  As the sentencing judge noted, Mr Khan at no stage attempted to inform the police of what was occurring, or what had been planned, and when he was assisting the police, in the early stages, he did not volunteer his own role in any offence.  After noting the evidence about coercion and the other matters to which reference has just been made, the sentencing judge said:
""The Crown submitted, and I agree, that the objective seriousness of the offending could be gauged by the following factors: the offender engaged in for applications for bank accounts in false names over a period of just over one year.  Each application was supported by the offender's presentation of a false passport.  Each false passport required the offender to have carried out a number of acts, including:
(i) Providing a photograph for the purpose of creating the false passports;(ii) Providing signatures in the false names for the purpose of creating a false passports;(iii) Possessing and presenting the passports as proof of identity.
As well as the false passports, the offender provided other documentation to support the applications.  The applications each required the personal attendance of the offender and a bank branch where he signed the application in a false name.
The offending conduct was planned and repeated as part of a wider scheme to use false identification to open bank accounts for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining money and/or financial advantages from banks and other institutions.
This offender was not the instigator or planner of the offences.  He was to some extent caught up in them, but he did participate in them.  In my view these factors point to the offences, although serious, falling towards the lower end of the scale for such offences, but not at the lowest end.""
37The foregoing comment was open to the sentencing judge and is not challenged on appeal.  The sentences that have been imposed are at the lower end of the scale for such offences, but not the lowest end.
38The ground of appeal that raises issues associated with totality, may, on one view, at least, be a different way of arguing the same issue raised by the ground of appeal relating to manifest excess. 
39The charging of two offences that involve common elements requires a court to ensure that there is no double punishment for the one offending course of conduct: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40].  In identifying whether a single act was an element of each offence charged, a court should approach the matter as a matter of common sense and not as a matter of semantics: Pearce at [42].
40When sentencing an offender for more than one offence, a sentencing judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and only then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence and questions of totality: Pearce at [45]; this approach should be taken even in circumstances where there is delay and different jurisdictions, or judges, are imposing the sentence: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59.
41There is no single correct answer to the foregoing exercise of discretion and it cannot be conducted arithmetically: Pearce at [46]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.  The principle of totality, which underpins the two grounds of appeal raised, requires that each individual sentence reflect the criminality of that offence and the overall sentence imposed reflects the total criminality of the crimes committed: Pearce.  
42In order for there to be manifest error, the outcome of the application of the sentencing discretion must imply some misapplication of principle, error of law or mistake of fact, or the consideration of extraneous or irrelevant material or the failure to consider relevant and necessary material; and it must not be referable to an identifiable error that is capable of being corrected: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 - 505.  Sentencing is an exercise of discretion that involves the intuitive synthesis of the competing goals of the sentencing process.  The sentence imposed by his Honour does not reflect manifest or identifiable error.
43As stated, when a sentencing judge is required to impose a sentence for a number of offences, related and unrelated, the sentencing judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then determine the degree to which the sentences will be served concurrently or will accumulate.  The purpose is to ensure that no aspect of the criminal conduct is the subject of double punishment and that the overall sentence reflects the criminality of the offending conduct, as a whole, and no more.
44Assessing the degree to which sentences should be served concurrently or cumulatively is quintessentially an instinctive or intuitive process.  Clearly, in this case, the sentencing judge has been aware of the principle of totality and has sought to accommodate that principle in the structure of the sentencing that has been imposed.  In applying the principle of totality, it is difficult to provide greater transparency than a correct statement of the facts and an express, or implied, application of the principle.
45Where this Court, on appeal, examines the application of the totality principle by a sentencing judge, assuming the principle has been purportedly applied, the result will either manifest a correct application of the principle or otherwise.  Again, the structure of the sentence imposed on Mr Khan does not manifest a misunderstanding or misapplication of the totality principle.  His Honour sentenced for seven counts involving both Commonwealth and State regimes.  He expressly imposed, in his view, ""a sentence... that is of a severity that is appropriate in all the circumstances"". I agree with that view.
46His Honour carefully differentiated between the regime under the Commonwealth legislation and under the State legislation.  He applied to each offence the appropriate criteria, prescribed by the different statutory regimes.  He fixed an appropriate sentence for each offence and an appropriate overall sentence: see Pearce. His Honour took account of the matters on the Commonwealth Schedule in fixing the sentence on Count 1, as well as the offences on the Form 1 in sentencing for Count 5, one of the State offences.
47His Honour correctly noted that general deterrence was an important factor in setting a sentence for these offences given the increasing prevalence of such offences in the community.  His Honour set out the subjective circumstances, to which findings there is no challenge; took into account the subjective circumstances in an appropriate manner; and considered whether a full-time custodial sentence was required, which, his Honour concluded, it was.
48The sentences imposed by his Honour do not disclose any error as a result either of manifest excess or a lack of totality.  These grounds of appeal must fail.
49Lastly on these issues, I should refer to the use of statistics.  The use of statistics is a helpful means of ascertaining, particularly where there is a large number of offences recorded, the sentences that have been imposed in the past, on average.  By definition, following a statistical pattern for past offences will, necessarily, entrench that pattern.  Statistics, therefore, while helpful, must be used with care.  In this case, the statistics are unhelpful in determining whether the sentencing judge has fallen into error: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45, (2010) 242 CLR 520.
Disparity
50In order for an appellant to succeed on the ground of appeal relating to disparity, a justifiable sense of grievance must be disclosed on the material before the Court.  Mere disparity or difference in a sentence that is imposed on co-offenders will not be sufficient.  There must be a disparity that does not reflect a rational difference between the co-offenders.
51The High Court of Australia dealt with the parity principle in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 86 ALJR 36.  In Green & Quinn, the High Court reiterated that the parity principle derives from the fundamental notion of equal justice, involving the general concepts of ""systematic fairness"", ""reasonable consistency"" and ""equality before the law"".  Equal justice is an aspect of the rule of law, which the majority in Green & Quinn traced to 16th century English philosophy and which was described by me in Jimmy v The Queen (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [254] - [256], by reference to a judgment of the Canadian Supreme Court, as deriving from Aristotelian concepts.  Equal justice is fundamental to the rule of law.
52Further, a ground of appeal that is based upon a lack of parity necessarily involves the proposition that there is no explicable basis for the distinction between the two sentences imposed and sought to be compared.  As a consequence, it is only after the Court considers whether the sentence that is subject to appeal is otherwise in accordance with law, and, to the extent it is not, corrects any error, that the Court is able meaningfully to deal with the issue of disparity with a co-offender.  It is because of that issue that I have chosen in these reasons to deal last with the ground of appeal that raises disparity in the sentences imposed.
53A difficulty that often arises, as was discussed in both Green & Quinn and Jimmy, is where the alleged sense of grievance associated with the disparity results from a comparison between participants in the one criminal enterprise who are charged with different offences.  The majority in Green & Quinn, after dealing with earlier judgements of the High Court on the parity principle, made clear that, because the foundation of the parity principle is ""in the norm of equality before the law"" and: 
""... its application [must] be governed by consideration of substance rather than form.  Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application.... The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of the sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant.... Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle.  The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged"" (at [30], per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
54In Jimmy, while each of the members of the Court expressed the principle slightly differently, the Court concentrated on the practical difficulties associated with the application of the principle to persons who were not strictly co-offenders, but, nevertheless, accepted that the principle, by whatever name it is called, applied (at [136], per Campbell JA, at [245]-[246], per Howie J, and in my reasons at [259]-[266]).  Ultimately, the question remains, in dealing with a ground of appeal based upon disparity, is the alleged sense of grievance justifiable?  It may be that the difference in the charges preferred justifies the difference in the sentence imposed, but that may not always be the case.
55The foregoing is best illustrated by an example.  Assume two persons kill another.  Also assume that the Crown has, for bona fide reasons, preferred a charge of manslaughter against one of the killers.  There is a plea of guilty and a sentence imposed.  Thereafter, on the basis of additional evidence obtained, the Crown prefers a charge of murder against the other killer, who pleads guilty.  Can it seriously be suggested that there can be a claim for disparity in sentence where one felon is sentenced for murder and the other for manslaughter, if given their objective and subjective circumstances were otherwise indistinguishable?
56It is necessary to examine in more detail the issues affecting the sentences of each different participant in the criminal enterprise, being the circumstances of the charges preferred against the relevant participants and, to the extent that a proper comparison is appropriate, their subjective and objective circumstances.
57On appeal, the Crown tendered a statement of facts detailing the whole of the criminal enterprise.  That statement of facts was marked exhibit A in the appeal.  It is unnecessary to repeat it.  For our purposes, it is sufficient to recite that Mr Hanif was relevantly the most senior member of the syndicate and planned and organised the criminal operation (either alone or with others) and was the person who was intended to obtain a significant part, if not all, of the proceeds of the crime.  Relevantly next in seniority was Mr Kumar.
58As earlier stated, Mr Kumar was sentenced to an aggregate head sentence of five years and six months with an aggregate non-parole period of three years and nine months.  Mr Khan does not seek parity with Mr Kumar.  Nor does he suggest that the sentence imposed on Mr Kumar gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
59Mr Khan also does not suggest that a proper comparison, for the purposes of sentencing, can be made with co-offenders Nazife Akram, Cheema, Deepak Verma, Anjali Verma, Padotan, or Sodhi and no disparity submission is based on their sentences.  Mr Khan submits that the justifiable sense of grievance arises from the disparity in sentence imposed upon him compared with the sentences imposed upon Mr Akram and Ms Khera.
60In relation to the charges preferred against each, I have earlier set out the charges against the applicant, to all of which he pleaded guilty.  The charges preferred against Ms Khera were two counts of possession of a false foreign passport, eight counts of providing a false foreign passport, two counts of opening a bank account in a false name, and one count of the use of a false instrument (13 charges in all).  Mr Akram was charged with one count of possession of a false foreign passport, one count of the use of the false certificate of Australian citizenship, and one count of providing a false foreign passport.  As can be seen, the charges preferred against each were quite different and may, of themselves, give rise to a rational difference in the sentences imposed.
61However, Ms Khera was charged with more offences of a more serious kind than Mr Khan.  Further, Ms Khera sought to have the sentencing judge take account of two further additional offences on the Schedule, being two counts of open a bank account in a false name.  Mr Khan, likewise, sought for the sentencing judge to take account of additional offences on a Schedule, being, one count of provide a false foreign passport, three counts of open a bank account in a false name, three counts of use a false instrument, and one count of obtaining financial advantage by misleading statement.  When these additional offences are taken into account, the number of offences (albeit of different kinds) for Mr Khan and Ms Khera are the same.  However, it must be remembered that it is only the offences, which are charged (not those on the Schedule), for which the offender is sentenced.
62Mr Akram's offences were committed over a period in excess of three years but, given the nature of the charges, there were significant periods of time in which no offences were committed.  Mr Khan's offences were committed over a period of some 12 months.  Ms Khera's offences were committed in 2002 and again in 2006 and 2007.  The last mentioned duration must be qualified by the fact that Ms Khera was overseas for a significant period between 2003 and 2006.
63Mr Khan's conduct, as has been stated, can generally be summarised as opening bank accounts and credit accounts with financial institutions by means of presenting false identity documents.  As has already been stated, Mr Khan was neither the instigator nor planner of the offences.  Mr Akram attended at RTA registries and fraudulently applied for drivers licences in false names using false identities.  
64It is necessary to deal, to some extent, with the role of Mr Kumar.  Ms Khera was Mr Kumar's wife. To some extent they acted together and their roles included the obtaining of drivers licences in false names, opening and operating bank accounts in false names and maintaining and storing information obtained and used by the syndicate relating to false identities.  
65However, Ms Khera was in the nature of a ""runner"" or ""courier"", acting under the directions of Mr Kumar and very much as a subordinate to him.  As a consequence, the role and objective criminality of her offences are significantly less than that associated with Mr Kumar.
66Mr Khan originally became involved in the criminal enterprise on the basis of a promise by Mr Hanif of full-time employment and an amount of money ($500), to which reference has already been made.  After his initial involvement, Mr Khan continued to be involved, on the evidence given by him, as a consequence of threats made by Mr Hanif that his involvement in the criminal enterprise would be disclosed to law enforcement authorities.  Nevertheless, Mr Khan did not rely upon duress as a defence to the commission of the offences.  Further, it is relevant that the only threat made was the disclosure of his initial involvement in crime.
67Mr Kumar initially became involved in the criminal enterprise, and continued to be involved in it, because of the financial circumstances associated with some failed business ventures.  There was some suggestion that Mr Hanif made threats of physical harm against Ms Khera and Mr Kumar's children, but the relevant sentencing judge did not accept that these threats occurred or were the motivating reason for Mr Kumar's criminal conduct.   
68Whatever Mr Kumar's motives were, the sentencing judge accepted that Ms Khera became involved, and continued to be involved, because of her husband and because of her misplaced loyalty and submissiveness to him.  In other words, the sentencing judge took account of the fact that under Ms Khera's traditional Hindu upbringing and culture she was overborne and required to be submissive to the wishes of Mr Kumar, even when he was acting illegally.  This was a significant subjective factor in determining the sentence to be imposed on Ms Khera.
69Further, Mr Kumar received between $200 and $1000 for each false bank account that he opened and Ms Khera benefited from those amounts because they were used to purchase household appliances and pay food and living expenses.
70Mr Akram had prior offences of a relevant kind.  Ms Khera had none and, as earlier stated, Mr Khan had some traffic offences.  Ms Khera was given a 25 percent discount for her plea of guilty because she entered a plea at the earliest possible opportunity.  Mr Akram was provided with a 50 percent discount for both the plea of guilty and the assistance given to police.  Again, as earlier stated, the discount allowed for the  late plea by Mr Khan was 10 percent.
71Further to the foregoing, the law enforcement authorities do not consider that Mr Khan has provided assistance of any note.  This fact, in terms of disparity should be compared, as stated, with the substantial assistance provided by Mr Akram for which he was provided a significant discount and for which he is, according to the relevant sentencing judge, likely to suffer more onerous conditions of incarceration.  Ms Khera provided no assistance but, on the material before the Court, Ms Khera's children were threatened as a result of the perceived assistance by her husband, Mr Kumar.  These threats are different to the allegations relating to Mr Kumar's motives (see [68] above) for the crime and occurred much later in time, when it was thought Mr Kumar was providing assistance to police.
72In the case of Mr Khan, the sentencing judge made no finding of remorse.  In the case of Ms Khera and Mr Akram, the relevant sentencing judges made findings of genuine and significant remorse and insight into the offending that had occurred.
73The foregoing facts were before the sentencing judge (or found by the sentencing judge) as part of the process of sentencing Mr Khan.  In summary, the charges preferred against Mr Akram are significantly different from those preferred against Mr Khan and that, of itself, may well explain the difference in sentencing between them.  However, to that must be added the discount afforded to Mr Akram for the early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities and the other matters to which reference has now been made.  In my view, there is no justifiable basis for feeling a sense of grievance as to the different sentence imposed upon Mr Akram, as compared to Mr Khan.
74Similarly, the difference between the sentence imposed upon Ms Khera and that imposed upon Mr Khan is, in my view, justified by the different circumstances relevant to each offender.  Even though Ms Khera has been seemingly charged and sentenced with more offences, each of which is serious, her role in carrying out the directions of Mr Kumar ameliorates the effect of that circumstance on objective seriousness.  In my view, as an overall enterprise and in terms of the role of each of Ms Khera and Mr Khan, it cannot be said that Ms Khera's role was greater than that of Mr Khan, nor that the objective seriousness of the offences was greater.
75Ms Khera was not, as submitted by Mr Khan, higher in the hierarchy than Mr Khan.  Further, Ms Khera's sentencing judge took into account, as a significant factor, her submissiveness and cultural role together with the threat to her children as a result of the perceived assistance of her husband.
76The difference in the sentence, on aggregate, imposed upon Ms Khera and Mr Khan were that Ms Khera received a sentence that was three months lighter in terms of aggregate non-parole period and six months lighter in the aggregate head sentence.  The different circumstances, both objective and subjective, relating to Ms Khera and Mr Khan permitted different treatment.  The difference between them does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance and is explicable on the facts before each of the sentencing judges.
77This ground also must fail.
Conclusion
78Each of the grounds of appeal, in my view, fails.  As a consequence, I propose that the Court make the following orders:
(i)Leave to appeal granted;
(ii)Appeal dismissed.

		03 July 2012",2012-06-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708025,R v Jesse POLOCK [2012] NSWDC 293,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1Mr D Patch, the Crown Prosecutor, referred to cases where an offender is at a crossroads. He acknowledged that, in this case, the offender has gone beyond the crossroads. This is a case which a judge in my position all too rarely comes across. The offender reached a crossroads in his young life some years ago and has clearly taken the path of rehabilitation and is getting his life back into order. That is very clearly demonstrated over the last few years. 

2The reason that he is before the Court for sentence is that he has been charged with supplying a prohibited drug. That is an offence against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Parliament regards the offence so seriously that it has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to it. 

3I will say something briefly about what happened to bring about this charge and then make some remarks about the personal circumstances of the offender Jesse Ernest Polock before sentencing him. 

4The circumstances to the offence are set out in exhibit B. Put simply, Mr Polock, over a period of a couple of months in 2008, was selling cocaine. Police had obviously intercepted his mobile phone service and they picked up a number of transactions between him and others where he was negotiating and selling cocaine. There are references to seven grams or a quarter of an ounce of cocaine. At one stage, he was asked how much he had and he said, ""I've got a fair bit.""

5At one stage, he was talking about being underpaid for a supply of cocaine. He should have been paid $2,100 for seven grams but was paid only about half that. There were discussions about adulterating or cutting the cocaine and more than once he referred to having a good supply. At one stage, one of his customers asked about his supply and Mr Polock answered ""I got twenty eight of the fuckers"" and the agreed facts indicate that that is a reference to an ounce or 28 grams of cocaine. He in fact sold that amount.

6Police searched his home on 20 September 2009 and he was arrested and charged. 

7Mr Polock does not have a clear criminal record. After the events which I have described, he faced this Court on another charge of supplying a prohibited drug which had occurred in 2007. He received a 3 year good behaviour bond which expired a few months ago. Apart from a driving offence, another offence was dealing with the proceeds of crime and he was given a suspended sentence by Zahra SC DCJ in this Court. 

8There is included amongst exhibit A a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service and this is where one begins to see what this young man has done since his offending behaviour. The report says amongst other things this -

""Mr Polock appears to be a young man who has achieved a degree of local celebrity through his surfing skills and has secured a traineeship as life saver, combining his interests with obtaining a profession and secure employment. He presented as somewhat immature and apparently had been affected by adverse peer influences. However, he has turned his life around, ceased using drugs and has been educating young offenders in describing his life story and the possibility of change. The insight he has gained is additionally supported by his positive family, girlfriend and community ties, as well as his demonstrated work ethic. In consideration of his current positive circumstances, lifestyle, community supports and his assessed low risk and needs, supervision or intervention programs are not indicated.""

9Mr R Jankowski who appears for Mr Polock with Ms J Levick also tendered a report from the forensic psychologist Tim Watson-Munro. Mr Munro acknowledged ""that the protracted nature of these proceedings has taken a significant toll"" on Mr Polock but he ""appears to have matured a great deal in the intervening period."" He comes from a stable family background in Maroubra and was educated to Year 10 and left school during Year 11 to commence work and following his interests.

10Apparently, he consistently expressed deep regret for his actions to the psychologist, who noted the positive steps he has taken towards his own rehabilitation. The psychologist did not detect what he described as ""any major psychopathology"", although he thought he was understandably suffering a reactive depression and anticipatory anxiety and showed some features of post traumatic stress linked mostly to the experiences he has in his employment. 

11He has a number of very favourable references from people who know him well and to whom he has disclosed his offending. He has impressed all those people who speak very highly of him. He makes a significant contribution to the community in many ways, both as a surf and sea rescuer and in speaking to younger people about his own offending. They refer to him as being ashamed and regretful for his actions and as breaking away from his previous bad influences. One referee spoke of him speaking to an audience of ""teenagers aged from 14-18"" which he described as ""most inspirational coming from a voice of Jesse's background.""

12He is employed by Waverley Council in a traineeship and I heard evidence from Mr Scott Field who is his supervisor and who spoke very highly of him as an individual; not only as an individual but as an outstanding trainee who has not yet reached his potential. 

13Mr Jankowski called his client. Jesse Polock is now 23 and drifted into a drug scene when he achieved some notoriety because of his considerable skills as a surfer, particularly in rough conditions. He started taking ecstasy and cocaine and marijuana and drifted into the drug scene. He has done some work over the years including for his father as a brickies labourer. He acknowledged the damage he did in the community particularly to those to whom he was selling drugs. He regarded his own behaviour as disgusting. His mother's health has been seriously affected by his behaviour and criminal activity. However, he has indeed turned his life around and has made considerable efforts in his employment and in all sorts of community activities. He is obviously severely remorseful for his own criminal behaviour and I accept that as a genuine expression of contrition. 

14Mr Glenn Polock, his father, was called to give evidence. He has travelled in the past with his son and has noticed a significant change of attitude from his son's drug taking days which he had noticed coincided with a change in his son's behaviour. He is now very proud of his son and very proud of what he has achieved and how he has turned his life around. 

15Mr D Patch who appeared as the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged, as did Mr Jankowski, the Court of Criminal Appeal's appropriate insistence that those engaged in trafficking in drugs (as Jesse Polock has) must face a gaol sentence. As Mr Patch said, it was a serious offence and Mr Polock had an ongoing business of selling cocaine but he said that there are quite unusual circumstances.

16One circumstance of course is that I am sentencing him for offending behaviour which occurred some 4 years ago. He was charged some 2 years ago. He has had the charge hanging over his head for that period of time whilst he has been on conditional liberty. He has used that time to turn his life around in an extraordinary way. As Mr Patch said ""We are not talking about a young man who we hope will rehabilitate himself but a young man who has proven his rehabilitation."" He accepted Mr Polock's expression of remorse and acceptance of responsibility. He has, as I observed in my opening comments, gone beyond the crossroads. Mr Patch said that whilst a custodial sentence was the only choice I had, it would not be erroneous to suspend that sentence. 

17One factor would be to take into account not only the delay, the rehabilitation which Mr Polock has undertaken but also his youth and relative immaturity at the time of his offending. He referred me to what the Court of Criminal Appeal had said in R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at 458 ([25]) about that. I did not call upon Mr Jankowski because he had led evidence which to my mind justified an order suspending the sentence. 

18Mr Patch suggested that a discount for the plea of guilty of about 10 per cent was in order and Mr Jankowski agreed. I would regard an appropriate sentence for the crime committed by Mr Polock as 1 year and 8 months, namely 20 months imprisonment but because of his plea of guilty, I propose to discount that by 10 per cent and fix a sentence of 18 months imprisonment. In due course I will make an order suspending that sentence. 

19I convict you of the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment. Under s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for 18 months.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Patch, Mr Jankowski, I do not think any other conditions are needed apart from good behaviour apart from the standard ones of turning up to court and change of address but the probation officer thought that he didn't need any supervision for example.

PATCH: That's right your Honour. The Crown will be guided by what's in the probation officer's report.

HIS HONOUR: That's what I thought. Thanks Mr Patch. Mr Jankowski, do you agree?

JANKOWSKI: Yes I will.

20The conditions of the bond are these.
(1)That you be of good behaviour.
(2)That you attend court if called upon to do so.
(3)That you notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in your residential address.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Polock, as I said at the start, it's most gratifying for a judge to have a case like this where somebody like you has turned their life around and you've done that. I get a lot of cases where the opposite has happened or, as Mr Patch the Crown Prosecutor said who has taken a very fair approach to your case, that where people are promising to do this or promising to do that and you never know. But you've actually demonstrated it and you've turned your life around. You are now contributing to the community instead of taking from the community and instead of in fact contributing to the community a substance that is deadly, you've stopped doing that. I've given you a prison sentence of 18 months. So you've got a prison sentence. You don't have to serve it because I have suspended it and I've suspended it for the whole 18 months. Travelling along with that 18 months is a good behaviour bond which you'll have to go downstairs and sign up for it and by that you've got to promise to be of good behaviour, stay out of trouble, no trouble at all, no pub brawls, no fights or anything like that at all. If you get a notice in the mail, you've got to come to court rather than have the sheriffs out chasing you, finding out where you are. If you change your address from where you're living now with your parents then you've got to write to the Registrar and let them know where you live.

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So they're the 3 conditions. Now something very important to explain because you've had a good behaviour bond before and you've just finished it. I have some confidence that you'll comply with this. I do because you've complied with a bond before. This bond is different and I'll tell you how it's different. If you breach this bond, it is very hard for me not to send you to gaol because these bonds come not just by themselves but with a gaol sentence: it's attached. When you come before the Court with a breach of this bond, even though it's minor, the legislation makes it very difficult for a judge not to send the offender to gaol.

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It's very hard, there's no wiggle room, very little wiggle room or wriggle room. So you've got to remember that. Mr Jankowski will explain it to you as well to emphasise it and so you've got to stay out of trouble for 18 months, all right. I have confidence that you will, that you'll get on with your life now and continue with the good work that you've been doing. Do you understand all of that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour, and I'd also like to keep continuing if there's any chance of talking to kids that have offended and I can maybe say in a way that look at the trouble that I've been in and like where I'm working now, you know you do get a second chance if you truly have a go at it.

HIS HONOUR: I think that's a good idea. I think young people - and I've read in the references - are obviously impressed by that and those who might otherwise come before me might be influenced by seeing somebody like you who has actually been there and done it. Not only a sporting hero in your past, that you fell off your perch and then you got yourself back together again, you can tell the whole story.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So they can look up to you in more ways than one and I think you telling a story like that can contribute a lot and make up for some of the damage that you brought to the community some years ago in a very positive way and I agree with that, I'm glad you have that in mind.

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right, good luck.

OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I'll now adjourn. Thank you gentlemen for your help.

2708026,R v Gordon Joshua SIMPSON [2012] NSWDC 268,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing Gordon Simpson for offences to do with breaking into people's houses and stealing. This is far from the first time that he has been sentenced for this sort of crime. He has spent a good amount of his adult life in gaol under sentence from various Local Court Magistrates for similar offences. He must be punished for these further crimes but, at the same time, I need to take into account his acknowledged need for rehabilitation. 

2I will say something about the crimes that I am sentencing him for then I will refer to his personal circumstances. I will mention the arguments for him and for the Prosecution before sentencing him. 

3The two crimes that I am sentencing him for are both, as I have said, break and enter offences. The first is called aggravated break enter and steal. He was armed with an offensive weapon, which explains the aggravation. That is a crime against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment for that crime. Not only that, Parliament regards the offence so seriously that it has fixed a standard non parole period of 5 years to the crime.

4The second offence is a break, enter and steal. That is an offence against s 112(1)(a) of the same Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment for that crime. 

5When I am sentencing him for each of the offences, Mr Simpson has asked me to take into account other offences which have been listed on two forms under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act 1999. I will take those offences into account and I sign forms to that effect. When I am sentencing him for the aggravated break enter and steal he has asked me to take into account three offences of remaining in a building with intended larceny. When I am sentencing him for the break and enter he has asked me to take into account a break enter and steal. 

6The aggravated break, enter and steal was committed by him on a Wednesday afternoon 17 August 2011. Luca Bartolomei came home to his house in Carrington Road, Randwick and found Mr Simpson there in the home. He had a backpack over his shoulders and a pair of orange handled scissors in his hand. The possession by him of the scissors explains why the offence is an aggravated break, enter and steal because the scissors are regarded as an offensive weapon. When confronted by the owner, Mr Simpson took the backpack off and left it on the floor. He left the house through the broken window, which he had smashed in order to get in. When he was taking the backpack off the scissors were raised towards the victim who was frightened that he was going to lunge at him. I accept that was not Mr Simpson's intention; he was simply removing the backpack. He left a bloodstain which matched his DNA. Although he left the backpack behind, he left with items in his pocket and his hands. Amongst the items he stole was a Rolex watch valued at about $8,000. He stole a wedding ring. He also stole two solid gold rings that belonged to Mr Bartolomei's grandfather. He stole a diamond necklace worth $4,000. 

7When I am sentencing him for that offence, I take into account the three offences of remain in a building with an intention to steal which all occurred on 20 August 2011 when he got into a secure car park in Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills at night time. He approached three cars and tried to get in. He smashed windows and caused damage. He stole an iPod from one of the cars but was unsuccessful in stealing things from the other cars. He left fingerprints again. That gave rise to the three charges that I am taking into account.

8The second offence occurred mid morning on Monday 22 August 2011. He broke into a unit in Jacques Avenue, Bondi Beach. In fact the offence occurred sometime between Monday 22 August and Thursday 25 August when the occupier came home and found that her unit had been broken into. Her personal belongings were spread over the hallway, drawers were open and property sprawled over the bed and the floor. The sliding glass balcony door was completely shattered and valuable jewellery in the bedroom was missing. When the police arrived they found that the unit had been ransacked. There was a screwdriver jammed in the outside lock. Again they found fingerprints. Not only that, they found a mobile phone. On the mobile phone were two photographs of Mr Simpson and some messages. 

9When I am sentencing him for that, I take into account a break enter and steal which had occurred some years beforehand on 27 January 2009 at Westmead. He broke into a unit in Priddle Street, Westmead. He broke a glass window and got in. He ransacked the unit. He stole nearly $6,000 worth of property, including watches, a necklace, cameras, a mobile phone, an iPod and dozens of DVDs.

10Mr Simpson was arrested on 29 August 2011 and whilst in custody he was charged with all the offences. Although he has been in custody since 29 August 2011, when he committed these offences he was on parole. So much of the time since his arrest, he has spent serving the balance of parole from an earlier sentence. In fact he did not commence serving time on these offences until 12 February 2012. Ms E Curran, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, argues that the sentence should date from 12 February 2012, although acknowledging that I have discretion. Mr A Wong, who appears for Mr Simpson, argues that I should backdate the sentence. I propose to date the sentences from 1 January this year.

11Mr Simpson has a bad criminal record which I have referred to briefly. He is now 26 and has been in trouble with the law since he was about 15. He made numerous appearances in the Children's Court for various offences, including stealing and destroying property. He received control orders and other punishments. He was referred to the Youth Drug Court at various stages. As an adult he has been before the Local Court numerous times. He has been given bonds, but has been convicted frequently of break, enter and steal. He has received prison sentences, some of them being for 2 years and at least one of them had a non-parole period of 18 months. As I said, he was in fact on parole when he committed the offences that I am sentencing him for. 

12This record of course is an aggravating factor and indicates the heightened need for me to consider the protection of the community from the activity of Mr Simpson and a factor such as specific deterrence. Another aggravating feature is of course the fact that he committed the offences whilst he was on parole. The explanation for this life of crime by Mr Simpson is tragically simple. He has been addicted to heroin for many years. 

13I will now say something about Mr Simpson's personal circumstances. Commendably, Mr Wong called his client to give evidence. He is an impressive young man and that is reflected in one or two of the reports that I have read. He has strong family support particularly from his mother, who is here in Court and has remained in touch with him since he has been in prison. He explained that when he was released last time he was getting his daily methadone dose but found it difficult to get to the clinic from his mother's home where he was staying. When he missed out because it had shut he resorted to heroin. He said a number of times that he expected it to be easy to adjust to life outside gaol but found it very hard. Once he used heroin the first time he was back into the habit. He quickly developed a need for spending $100 - $200 a day, which explains, but does not of course in any way justify, his criminal activity. Revealingly, he said he found it a lot easier in prison because of the routine. In fact that was the focus of one of Mr Wong's arguments about the risk of institutionalisation. When he was confronted by the man in Randwick he had used the scissors to get in and he was shocked to see him. He was holding the scissors when he took his backpack off. I accept that explanation. 

14I should have added earlier that the combined value of the amounts he stole from the Randwick place was something like $13,000. He had selected the Jacques Avenue unit at random. He was desperate and simply breaking in. As Mr Wong said, there was no planning or sophistication. There hardly could be, given the amount of evidence he left behind. He acknowledged how the occupants of these units must have reacted to their homes and lives being invaded, how upset and unsafe they must have felt. 

15He has some tickets for use of machinery. He spent some time working at the Fish Markets some years ago. 

16He had started using heroin aged 14 or 15. He hardly drinks alcohol and does not use other drugs. In that way, his habit is rather unique although still, of course, a tragic aspect of his life. He has had a word with Benelong Haven in Kempsey and would like to go there. He acknowledges the need for a residential facility. He had tried such facilities when he was a teenager but they were unsuccessful. He acknowledges that there is little point in him being released into the community without support and acknowledges that the choice is his. He acknowledged in cross examination by Ms Curran, that he had breached bonds before and had committed these offences within weeks of being released on parole previously. He has participated in programmes for rehabilitation in prison and also programmes designed to warn children of the dangers of drugs. 

17There is a report about him from an alcohol and other drugs counsellor at the MRRC at Silverwater. The author notes that Mr Simpson ""appears genuine in his desire to live a drug-free lifestyle and to give back to his community all the cultural support he has been receiving whilst in custody."" I make the same observation. The report referred to his employment at the Fish Market and the author described Mr Simpson as ""an extremely polite and culturally aware young Aboriginal man and presents as genuine in his wanting to change in his life."" Once again, my observations are the same. He is trusted in the prison system and has become involved in cultural activities. 

18Mr Wong arranged for him to see a clinical psychologist, Peter Champion, who provided a report that became Exhibit 1. Mr Champion described a dysfunctional upbringing because of the drinking by both of his parents. I add that his mother is no longer drinking and is a great support to him. Mr Champion noted Mr Simpson's desire to change the course of his life and that he had some concern about becoming institutionalised. He told Mr Champion that there ""was little point to simply releasing him from prison, whether on parole or not, as he did not cope and tended to relapse reasonably quickly."" Looking ahead, Mr Champion said that it is quite clear that if Mr Simpson cannot manage his addiction then ""the risk of further offending will be significant."" His prognosis in such circumstances would be poor. Mr Champion was guarded about his prognosis, acknowledging that it was ""necessary to see whether he can utilise AOD treatment effectively, and as he himself indicated, whether he can break the cycle."" Mr Champion described him as finishing at year 10 in school and being of sound intellect and literate. He thought that he should be assessed for an intensive pre-release AOD treatment program. 

HIS HONOUR: I pause there from my remarks on sentence. Mr Wong, at some stage - well, soon -I will ask you to get instructions about sending Mr Champion's report to the Corrective Services Department, that section which assesses him for classification. The officers in that section have indicated that they are greatly assisted by such material. On the other hand, not all prisoners want such material within the system so I understand that it is a matter for instructions and I won't send it unless you agree. I will return to my remarks on sentence.

19Mr Wong asked for a lengthy parole period so that his client can make use of a residential rehabilitation facility. He argued that both offences that I am sentencing his client for were at the lower end of seriousness. The scissors were not used as a weapon but to break in. Jacques Avenue was chosen randomly. Both those observations are correct although as Ms Curran said the amounts of money stolen at both break-ins was significant. They were obviously unplanned and unsophisticated. 

20Mr Simpson has spent in his young adult life some 5 years in prison and only about 3 years in the community. It is important to avoid him becoming institutionalised. Mr Wong argued for some concurrency in the sentencing, pointing out that the offences I am sentencing him for all occurred over a five day period from 17 to 22 August 2011. Because of the lengthy periods he has spent in custody, he urged me to backdate the sentence. I have indicated that I will commence the sentence at the start of this year. 

21Mr Wong urged me to impose a sentence of less than 3 years. I can say now that I would regard such a sentence as too low. Ms Curran pointed to the obvious aggravating features of the offences being committed on parole and the importance of general and specific deterrence. Mr Simpson has a history of not abiding with the conditions of his bond. She referred to the guideline judgment issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327; [1999] NSWCCA 435 and pointed out that many of the factors in that guideline are present here. Addiction, of course, is not a mitigating feature. Ms Curran fairly acknowledged that Mr Simpson was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty and acknowledged that there were special circumstances to warrant an adjustment in the standard relationship between the non-parole period and the full term of the sentence. She said I could not reduce the non-parole period too much because of the importance of deterrence. Unfortunately, she said, residential rehabilitation has failed previously. That observation is true but Mr Simpson was still a teenager when he last attempted residential rehabilitation. 

22I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period because Mr Simpson has pleaded guilty to both offences. 

23I regard an appropriate sentence for the principal offence - bearing in mind I accept the submission that it is at the lower end of objective seriousness even though the amount involved was significant - as being 4 years and 8 months. Because Mr Simpson has pleaded guilty I will reduce that by 25 per cent so the sentence that I would impose for the aggravated break, enter and steal would be 3 ½ years imprisonment. For the break, enter and steal I would regard an appropriate sentence as 2 years and 8 months. I would discount that by 25 per cent so that the appropriate sentence would be 2 years imprisonment. I would direct that there be some accumulation of those two sentences and some concurrence. I would regard an appropriate overall sentence as one of 5 years imprisonment. 

24The appropriate sentence for the aggravated break, enter and steal would be 3 ½ years imprisonment and that is before a discount and the appropriate sentence for the break and enter would be 2 years imprisonment before a discount. I would partially accumulate and partially specify that those 2 sentences run at the same time with an overall result of 5 years imprisonment. I would then discount that 5 years by 25 per cent, fixing a sentence of 3 years and 9 months which I intend to impose as an aggregate sentence for both crimes. The sentence of 3 years and 9 months will commence on 1 January 2012. 

25I do propose to exercise my discretion and vary the ratio between the non-parole period and the full term. The non-parole period would normally be some 75 per cent of 3 years and 9 months but I propose to reduce it significantly to just over 50 per cent, so that the non-parole period will be 1 year and 11 months. It will commence on 1 January 2012 and expire on 30 November 2013 and the overall sentence will expire on 30 September 2015. 

26I should say this about the aggregate sentence that I will impose. It is relatively lenient. I hope not too lenient. It needs to take into account the seriousness of the conduct, particularly given that Mr Simpson was on parole when he committed the crimes and has a bad criminal record. On the other hand, I too am impressed by him as a young man trying to get his life back into order. He has a single addiction and a good amount of family support. He appears genuine and determined to try to get his life back in order. Many other aspects of his life, including his employability and family support, are helpful for him. I have taken those factors into account, particularly given his age, in fixing a relatively lenient sentence, one which will require him to serve time in prison for the rest of this year and most of next year, but then I have allowed for a substantial period of time on parole so that hopefully he can make good use of a residential rehabilitation facility. 

27I am now going to sentence you Mr Simpson, if you would stand up? I fix a non-parole period of 1 year and 11 months that will commence on 1 January 2012 and expire on 30 November 2013. The overall sentence will be 3 years and 9 months commencing on 1 January 2012 and expiring on 30 September 2015. The earliest date on which it appears on the information available to me that you will be released is 30 November 2013. If you would have a seat now please Mr Simpson?

HIS HONOUR: Mr Wong, Ms Curran, look carefully at it. I think it's right mathematically.

CURRAN: It appears to be right, I'm just a little confused in relation to the references of 4 years and 8 months for the aggravated break and enter.

HIS HONOUR: I got confused partway through it, you are right. 

28The sentence that I would indicate is appropriate for the aggravated break and enter is 3½ years. The sentence that I would indicate is appropriate for the break and enter is 2 years. I would partially accumulate and partially direct that they run together and the result would be 5 years as a combined sentence. I would then discount the 5 years by 25 per cent to represent the plea, so that I reach the final sentence of 3 years and 9 months. Under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I impose an aggregate sentence. 

HIS HONOUR: I have indicated what the four sentences would be and what I was trying to do unsuccessfully was to indicate what the discounted sentences would be. I will indicate that now. 

29The discounted sentence for the aggravated break, enter and steal would be 2 years and 7 months. The discounted sentence for the break and enter would be 18 months and I would partially accumulate and partially direct that they be concurrent to produce 3 years and 9 months. 

30I have to indicate under s 53A what the sentences would be, and the sentences that I indicate are 2 years and 7 months for the aggravated break and enter and 18 months for the break and enter. 

HIS HONOUR: Check that to make sure it makes sense, both of you.

CURRAN: Those figures appear to be right to me. The only other issue I have was, and I'm not sure if it was just I not hearing your Honour correctly when your Honour provided the dates in relation to the non-parole period. So that's for a period of 1 year and 11 months, which commences on 1 January 2012 and expires on 30 November 2013. I thought I misheard your Honour saying that the parole period commences on 30 January 2014.

HIS HONOUR: That's wrong, the overall sentence is 1 January 2012 and 30 September 2015. Non-parole period 1 January 2012 to 30 November 2013. So it follows that the balance of the term is 2 years and 2 months I think. 

CURRAN: The only other thing was, at the start of your Honour's remarks on sentence your Honour referred to the offender serving his balance of parole, your Honour indicated that finished on 12 February.

HIS HONOUR: What was the date?

CURRAN: The 19th.

HIS HONOUR: The record should be corrected. 

31My indication of 12 February should be 19 February. 

HIS HONOUR: I was casting around looking for the date and then I picked it from memory wrongly, but thanks Ms Curran. 

CURRAN: Finally, the Crown is seeking compensation in relation to the break, enter and steal offences and also the damage offences in the cars. Your Honour will see in the agreed set of facts it refers at the end of each offence the compensation sought by the victims of those matters. So I'd ask your Honour to make those orders.

WONG: The concern that I would have is the utility of making such orders, given the time that Mr Simpson will be in custody and not earning an income, and then the difficulties that he will be facing when he is released. Beyond that, I have nothing further to say as to the practicalities of imposing a compensation order that in all likelihood won't be able to be paid.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Curran, if I don't impose a compensation order, does that compromise the rights of the victims to any recompense?

CURRAN: Not that I'm aware of, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: No. See, what I'm aware of is his need to make a fresh start when he gets out and gets himself rehabilitated, and, if he enters his working life with a fairly crushing compensation order, justified as though it would be, and that's pursued, it would just be another obstacle in getting himself on his right path. I refuse the application.

CURRAN: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, the balance of the term is 1 year and 10 months.

WONG: If I could just seek those instructions in relation to the report?

HIS HONOUR: Would you do that, yes. 

MATTER INTERPOSED

WONG: There is no issue with the reports being provided.

HIS HONOUR: Good, thank you, they do say it is helpful in classification. All right, my associate will send those to the appropriate authorities. 

Now, Mr Simpson, I have got to explain the sentence to you. It makes sense, I'm sure. I have gaoled you for 3 years and 9 months - that is your prison sentence - it is one sentence for both of them.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I have backdated it until 1 January. There was a good argument for starting it on 19 February, but I have made a couple of concessions, significant ones in your favour, okay?

OFFENDER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: And I'm starting it on 1 January. I have directed that there be a non-parole period that you must stay in gaol, starting on the same day, 1 January, of 1 year and 11 months, which will mean that you are eligible for release on 30 November next year, 30 November 2013.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Whether you are released or not depends on the Parole Authority, which you know as well as I do. Once again, that non-parole period is shorter than it might otherwise be - I am just going to work it out - for a sentence of 3 years and 9 months, the non-parole period would be something like 2 years and 9 months, almost 2 years and 10 months, and I have reduced it to 1 year and 11 months, all right?

OFFENDER: Half of that time will probably be spent at rehab, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I'm glad to hear that. Good on you. Well, look, as I said, frankly, it's a lenient sentence, okay? I hope not too lenient, and that you don't face a Crown appeal, but that's not my decision. I have erred deliberately in your favour because you have impressed me and you have impressed the people that you are fair dinkum in your efforts. You have got a serious addiction that you have got to deal with. You are realistic about acknowledging your need for support when you get out of prison. It doesn't work when you are unsupported. You know that, and that's an important insight. You are getting help in prison. You have obviously impressed the authorities there. You need to be given a chance. That's why I didn't order the compensation.

OFFENDER: I have had a fair few chances but--

HIS HONOUR: I know you have.

OFFENDER: I just say thank you for the chances I've been given.

HIS HONOUR: All right, you have got to make use of it. You've got to use that time to rehab and then stay in contact with Benelong or somewhere like that, get yourself into the centre.

OFFENDER: That's (not transcribable).they've got a lot of programmes up there that would suit me.

HIS HONOUR: I know they do, I know about some of those places. I have visited one or two of them, and they're very good, and, once you get your life back on track and deal with this heroin addiction, you've got a bright future in front of you, and you've already impressed people with your contributions, and you've got a good future in front of you, but you've got to deal with this heroin addiction, and let them do it. So I'm erring on the side of giving you a chance, and I'm not taking a risk - the community is - not me. It's easy for me to sit here and do this, but, if you break it, it means that once again you're going to scare people to death by breaking into their units, by losing stuff - you can imagine what it's like to lose your grandfather's gold rings, your watches, your jewellery, your CDs, things like that, all precious for people. You can imagine how their lives - this woman moved out of her unit in Bondi, couldn't go back to it, complete disruption - so it's not me taking the risk, it's the community taking the risk, and that's why I am going to trust you with this relatively lenient sentence. Good luck. All right, make the best use of it.

Mr Wong, thank you for your assistance. Ms Curran, thank you for your assistance.

2708028,Mendes v R [2012] NSWCCA 103,"Judgment

1WHEALY JA:   I agree with Davies J.

2DAVIES J:   On 19 July 2007 the Applicant pleaded guilty to two offences as follows:

Count 1:  Maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Stefanie Rugiano with intent to do grievous bodily harm (maximum penalty - 25 years imprisonment; standard non-parole period - 7 years imprisonment);

Count 2:  Maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Simon Paduch with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

3The Applicant also asked for the following offences to be taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of Count 1:

(a) Malicious damage;
(b) Possess prohibited drug being 0.07g methylamphetamine;
(c) Possess prohibited drug being 4.1g cannabis leaf.

4The Applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Hock on 1 February 2008 as follows:

Count 2:  Imprisonment for five years commencing 8 October 2006.

Count 1:  Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of four years commencing 8 October 2009 and expiring on 7 October 2013.

Her Honour said that she declined to set a non-parole period in respect of Count 2 due to the structure of the sentences.

5The overall effective sentence was a non-parole period of 7 years with an additional term of three years.

Facts

6The following facts are largely taken from the Sentencing Judge's Remarks on Sentence.

7The Applicant had been in a relationship with Ms Rugiano for approximately eight months prior to the date of the offences. They both lived in the Wollongong area. 

8On Saturday 7 October 2006 Ms Rugiano and a number of other friends attended a wedding in Sydney. The Applicant had not been invited but he and Ms Rugiano had arranged that they would meet up after the wedding. They were staying at the Meriton Apartments in Pitt Street. 

9The Applicant arrived there about 7pm and let himself into the room where they were staying. Whilst there he used methylamphetamine and cannabis, and drank whiskey while he waited for her to return.

10Over the next few hours the Applicant had some telephone contact with Ms Rugiano which, in his intoxicated state, caused him to become suspicious of her and angry. 

11Ms Rugiano arrived back at the room with three of her friends including Simon Paduch at about 1:00am. She and the Applicant began to argue and the other friends including Mr Paduch left the room. As Mr Paduch left he touched Ms Rugiano on the elbow to reassure her. 

12This action inflamed the Applicant, and Ms Rugiano told him that it was over between them. The Applicant then grabbed her around the neck and began to hit and slap her. He dragged her by the leg towards the open door leading to the balcony and told her that he was going to throw her off. She resisted by grabbing onto the balcony doorframe. 

13The Applicant then threatened to kill himself, and jumped onto the table on the balcony at which point Ms Rugiano managed to get back into the hotel room where the Applicant eventually joined her.

14Ms Rugiano recalled seeing the Applicant obtain a knife from one of the drawers in the kitchen area of the hotel room. At this point she became so fearful that she was unable to recall precisely what followed. However, at some point the Applicant withdrew from the room into the corridor. 

15Ms Rugiano told him that she was going downstairs to get some band-aids and she went to the lift. The Applicant followed her telling her to come back. When she told him to calm down he said, ""Oh, my God, I've stabbed you, I'm going to gaol."" 

16He followed her to the lift and got in with her. She saw that he was holding a knife. He placed it to the side of his own neck and she got out of the lift and got into a second lift. 

17When she arrived at the ground floor she was seen by one of her friends, a Ms Cappetta, who was waiting for her, to come running out of the lift screaming: 

He's trying to kill me. He tried to throw me off the balcony. He had a knife to my throat. Call the police.

18Ms Cappetta observed that Ms Rugiano had a fair amount of blood on the back right armpit of her clothing and that she appeared hysterical. 

19The Applicant then arrived on the ground floor. Ms Rugiano ran out of the hotel and into Bathurst Street with Mr Paduch. The Applicant followed yelling at Ms Rugiano. 

20The Applicant produced a knife and when Ms Rugiano was on the ground the Applicant swung the knife more than once at her shoulder causing her to cry out in pain. Ms Cappetta flagged down a passing ambulance to seek assistance. 

21The Applicant then moved towards Mr Paduch and stabbed him in the shoulder area, also lacerating his right ear. Mr Paduch moved towards the ambulance but as he did so he felt a second sensation to his shoulder area as the Applicant stabbed him again. A photograph tendered showed the wound to be at the base of Mr Paduch's neck, with the wound having been inflicted from behind. Mr Paduch fell briefly to his knees and then got up and ran across Bathurst Street. 

22The Applicant then returned to Ms Rugiano. A passer by, Ms Harman, attempted to get between them to prevent injury to Ms Rugiano and the three struggled briefly. Ms Harman saw that the Applicant took hold of Ms Rugiano's hair and attempted to pull her to the ground. She ended up in a kneeling position with her head bent towards the ground and Ms Harman tried to hold onto the Applicant's right hand. 

23The Applicant attempted to stab at Ms Rugiano's neck more than once. She was screaming in pain and crying out. On the final swing the knife became lodged in Ms Rugiano's upper arm. The Applicant then ran from the scene. 

24Ms Rugiano, Mr Paduch and the others took refuge in the ambulance. Two security guards chased the Applicant and held him until the police arrived. He said to the security guards:

I know you can bash me if you want but I want you to know one thing, that they deserved it.

25When the police arrived the Applicant was arrested and taken to City Central Police Station.

26The Applicant took part in an electronically recorded interview where he admitted responsibility for the wounding of the two victims. He said he had suspicions about the two of them being involved and that he and Ms Rugiano had argued. The argument had been prompted by her switching her phone off but had continued with her ""like, pushing me and stuff"". He then said, ""On the crystal, I suppose I kind of blanked out, I suppose"". He also told the police officers that he had been drinking, that he just lost it and that he ""still can't remember properly"".

27In the course of the interview the Applicant said that he had carried the knife originally as he had been told it was dangerous in Sydney. He had taken it from his bum bag after Ms Rugiano went downstairs and said to the Police, ""I just wanted to scare them so that they're telling the truth"". He also said that he had not intended to kill anyone but he had wanted to scare them as they had hurt him emotionally. 

28He also said to the Police ""I shouldn't have done it that way."" 

29He told the Police that he had used ice and pot since he was 15 years old and that he would use about three grams of cannabis a day and ice on a weekly basis. However, he said that his usage of ice had decreased to once a month recently. He believed he had used 0.5 of a gram of ice during the day prior to these offences. He also said that he had drunk three-quarters of a bottle of Chivas Regal.

30An examination of the hotel room by the police revealed a water pipe, 4.1 grams of cannabis leaf and 0.07 grams of methylamphetamine in crystalline form. There was also damage to the front door of the room, the bathroom door and the internal walls of the bedroom. Those were the matters forming the charges on the Form 1.

31As a result of the attack Mr Paduch suffered a three centimetre deep wound to the right side of the neck with an associated laceration to the right ear. He also received a five centimetre deep wound to the right upper side of the back. No major organs or vessels had been damaged.

32Mr Paduch had lost a significant amount of blood when treated in the Emergency Department of St Vincent's Hospital. He was rushed to the operating theatre and under a general anaesthetic an angiogram was performed. The neck vessels were found to be normal. Active bleeding from small vessels was controlled. 

33Mr Paduch has two scars, one of which traverses the base of his neck for approximately five centimetres. He has subsequently required physiotherapy for pain and spasm in his right shoulder.

34A Victim Impact Statement from Mr Paduch shows how badly he has been affected by the attack. It has affected his relationships with other people including his desire to socialise. It has interfered with his sleep patterns. He is affected by the ugly scarring which remains.

35Ms Rugiano was treated for a stab wound to the right shoulder, the chest wall, the left neck, the wrist, the ear and the scalp. Treatment involved removal of the knife from the shoulder wound. 

36Ms Rugiano was unstable on admission to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency Department. She had lost a great deal of blood and required three units of transfusion. When she was stabilised she was operated on. 

37The wound to her shoulder had lacerated the deltoid fascia into the muscle down to the humeral bone. It penetrated the subdeltoid fascia which required further debridement. 
38Her left wrist was operated on and there was a partial laceration to one tendon. The wound then penetrated further into the radiostyloid stabilising a piece of bone which contains the first dorsal compartment. The bone was replaced and fixed in place. 

39She has had extensive physiotherapy for her wrist injury. She has suffered post traumatic stress disorder and by the time of the sentence she had undergone 30 sessions with a psychologist and continued to be seen fortnightly. The report from Audrey Jones, the treating psychologist, details the extent of the emotional and psychological sequelae from the attack.

Subjective features

40The Applicant was aged 22 at the time the offences were committed. He is now aged 28. 

41The Sentencing Judge noted that he was an only child of a loving family for many years but now has a brother some 18 years younger than him. His parents emigrated from Portugal when the Applicant was five years old but returned to that country when he was eight. Whilst he was there he was the victim of sexual assaults by older teenage boys. These were not disclosed by him to anyone until he was interviewed by various persons after these present offences were committed. The assaults led him to become withdrawn and anxious.

42When the family returned to Australia his anxiety lessened, as the Sentencing Judge found. However, he began using cannabis and amphetamines, particularly ice, on a daily basis from the age of fifteen. He told Dr Westmore that this helped with his anger and flashbacks over the sexual assaults. The Sentencing Judge found that these incidents contributed to his decision to use drugs regularly at a young age. 

43The Applicant had difficulties in high school and left before completing Year 10. He began working on a construction site with his father and gained qualifications as a carpenter. He was working in that capacity until he fractured his leg in March 2006.

44The Applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. The Sentencing Judge accepted that he was genuinely remorseful. She said that he had never acted violently previously, and she thought it was the dangerous combination of illegal drugs, ice in particular, excessive consumption of alcohol and emotional distress over his grandfather's admission to hospital that very day, which led to what her Honour described as impulsive attacks. Her Honour noted that Dr Westmore said there would have been an impairment of the Applicant's capacity to form reasonable and rational judgments on the day concerned.

45Her Honour said that, like Dr Westmore, she was of the opinion that the Applicant was highly motivated to overcome his drug and alcohol problems. He gave unchallenged evidence at the sentencing hearing that he had not used illegal drugs in gaol although he had the opportunity to do so. He had completed a number of courses or programs in custody to address his problems. Her Honour noted also that he had the benefit of a supportive family who visited him regularly. 

46The Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant had good prospects for rehabilitation provided he maintained his resolve to abstain from the use of illegal drugs. 

47Her Honour noted that he had been in protective custody since shortly after being imprisoned with the result that he was only able to be out of his cell for about two hours a day. Her Honour noted that such a situation might not continue once he was a sentenced prisoner. There was no evidence at the hearing of this appeal about that matter. 


Grounds of appeal

48The Applicant was sentenced on 1 February 2008. On 20 February 2008 a Notice of Intention for Leave to Appeal was filed. No Appeal was filed and on 4 August 2008 a Notice of Application for Extension of Period within which Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal was filed. An extension of time was granted and the Applicant was advised that the Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal would expire on 20 October 2008. No Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed within the time limited. 

49On 22 December 2011 the Applicant filed a further Notice of Application for Extension of Period within which Notice of Intention to apply for Leave to Appeal. The affidavit in support was sworn by his father, Manuel Mendes. The affidavit said that the Applicant had always wanted to appeal the severity of the sentence. Both the deponent and his son had always believed that an appeal was on foot from very shortly after the time sentence was handed down. That was said to have been based on numerous express representations over a period of years by the Applicant's legal advisors to the effect that an appeal had been lodged. The affidavit disclosed that, on a number of occasions, the solicitor for the Applicant, when asked, referred to the indisposition of the barrister who had been obtained to prepare the necessary documents for the appeal. 

50The Crown did not challenge any of the material contained in Mr Mendes' affidavit, nor did it oppose an extension of time being granted. 

51Although the delay is considerable, it has been sufficiently explained, and in the absence of objection from the Crown the extension of time should be granted.

52The grounds of appeal are these:

Ground 1 - Her Honour erred by giving primary significance in the sentencing exercise to the existence of a standard non-parole period.

Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in the manner in which she took into account the Applicant's intoxication.

Ground 3 - Her Honour erred by declining to set a non-parole period in relation to Count 1.

Ground 4 - Her Honour erred by failing to give proper effect to the principle of totality.

Ground 5 - The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive.

The approach to the sentence

53The Sentencing Judge recited the facts and the subjective features relevant to the Applicant as I have already detailed. She referred to the difficulty in sentencing, particularly as only two authorities were provided, being decisions of this Court on successful appeals by offenders. In addition, her Honour identified two other cases both of which were Crown appeals. She said that the cases made very clear that the result of the offender's conduct would, to a very significant degree, determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. 

54The Sentencing Judge then said that she had to consider the question whether it was appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period for either of the offences. She noted that the Crown submitted that each of the offences was in the mid-range of objective seriousness but that the Applicant submitted each was just below the mid-range. Her Honour concluded that each offence was at the mid-range of objective seriousness.

55Her Honour then concluded that it was not appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period for two reasons. First, the Applicant's early plea of guilty entitled him to a reduction of 25%. Secondly, his strong subjective case, in particular his lack of previous convictions, his genuine remorse and his good prospects for rehabilitation justified a departure from the standard non-parole period. 

56Her Honour also found special circumstances because it was the Applicant's first period in custody. Finally, her Honour thought there should be some concurrence in the sentences.

Ground 1 - The standard non-parole period

57Her Honour said in relation to the standard non-parole period:

I come now to the question of whether it is appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period for either offence in this case. The Crown submitted that each offence was at the mid range and Mr Kintominas on behalf of the offender submitted that each was just below the mid range. On the material before me I find that each offence was at the mid range of objective seriousness. However, I have determined that in neither case is it appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period. My reasons are, firstly, the early pleas of guilty which entitle the offender to a reduction of twenty-five per cent in each sentence for the utilitarian value of those pleas to the criminal justice system and as indicating an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. Secondly, the offender's strong subjective case, in particular his lack of previous convictions, his genuine remorse and his good prospects for rehabilitation.

58The Applicant submitted that those remarks demonstrated that the existence of the standard non-parole period was of primary significance in the determination of the sentences. The Applicant further submitted that her Honour engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing contrary to what was said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The Applicant submitted that the two-stage process was most clearly demonstrated by her Honour's identification of the offender's strong subjective case as one of the reasons why the standard non-parole period should not be imposed. 

59In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 this Court said:
Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre-Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick. 

60Although in the present case the Sentencing Judge was considering an Applicant who had pleaded guilty, the way her Honour has expressed herself shows that undue emphasis has been given to the standard non-parole period. Her Honour has used it as the starting point and then determined whether there should be any variation from it. Even prior to Muldrock, where there was a guilty plea, the standard non-parole period was used simply as a benchmark or guidepost. Her only reference to the guilty plea when discussing the standard non-parole period was the fact that it would result in a reduction of 25% for the utilitarian value of that plea. 

61Her Honour then, by considering reasons that she should depart from the standard non-parole period, tended to engage in the two-stage sentencing approach proscribed by Muldrock at [28]. 

62The Crown's submissions appeared to accept that the Sentencing Judge had wrongly treated the standard non-parole period as the starting point rather than regarding it and the maximum penalty as the two legislative guideposts as Muldrock requires.

63In my opinion, this ground is made out.

Ground 2 - The Applicant's intoxication

64The Applicant argued that because his addiction to drugs had commenced at a young age and was chronic, it could not be said that his intoxication on the night concerned was a rational choice that would carry with it moral culpability for the predictable consequences of that choice - see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [173]-[207]. 

65The Applicant submitted that the issue of the Applicant's intoxication needed careful consideration whereas the only reference to it being considered by the Sentencing Judge was to be found in the following passage:

Unsurprisingly Dr Westmore, who is a highly regarded forensic psychiatrist, said at p. 8 that in his opinion there would have been an impairment of the offender's capacity to form reasonable and rational judgments. This of course only highlights the dangers of any person, but this offender in particular, carrying such a weapon as that depicted in the photographs which are part of Exhibit E. 

66The Applicant argued that his intoxication should have been regarded as a mitigating factor to some degree.

67Apart from the passage quoted above her Honour made other reference to the Applicant's drug use. She noted that he began using cannabis and amphetamines, ice in particular, on a daily basis from the age of 15. She noted that he told Dr Westmore that this helped with his anger and flashbacks over the sexual assaults. She found that those sexual assaults at least contributed to his decision to use drugs regularly at such a young age. 

68As noted earlier, her Honour found that the Applicant had never acted violently before; that it was because of the dangerous combination of illegal drugs, particularly ice, excessive consumption of alcohol and emotional distress over his grandfather's admission to hospital that day which led to what her Honour described as impulsive attacks; that the Applicant was highly motivated to overcome his drug and alcohol problems; that he had not used illegal drugs in gaol even though he had had the opportunity to do so; and that he had completed a number of courses or programs in custody because, he wanted to address his problems. 

69It does not seem to me that her Honour failed to consider adequately the issue of the Applicant's drug taking and the effect that it had, or may have had, on his personality over a period of time. Her reference to what Dr Westmore said at page eight of his report showed that she had those matters in mind. 

70Her Honour had also a lengthy report from Gerard Glancey, a psychologist, who had examined the Applicant. That report disclosed, on the basis of what the Applicant told Mr Glancey that, on the day in question, he was stressed because his girlfriend had been invited to the wedding and he had not, and his grandfather had been admitted to hospital in a critical condition. He told Mr Glancey (in contradistinction to what he had told the police on the night of the assault) that he had not smoked ice at that time for approximately eight months. He gave evidence to similar effect at the sentencing hearing. Because, apparently, of the stress he was under, he had gone with a friend and smoked ice. He became increasingly suspicious about his girlfriend's unfaithfulness. Earlier that day he had taken a bottle of scotch from his parents' home and during the course of the day he had consumed the greater contents of that bottle by drinking quickly and heavily. 

71Those actions which led to his intoxication by drugs and alcohol do not suggest that the intoxication should be regarded as a mitigating factor even given his earlier history of consumption of drugs.

72The Applicant submitted that he had never previously been violent or been in a fight prior to this time. However, the report from Mr Glancey suggested otherwise. Mr Glancey said this:

He spoke of associating to an ever increasing degree with drug users and drug dealers. Many of these people were involved in crime. They criticised him over his passive nature. They questioned why he tolerated certain treatment from peers. They encouraged him to stand up for himself. They spoke of hitting people if necessary. These people employed violence in their dealings with others. ""They didn't take crap from no-one"". He felt they were respected within their peer group. They were liked by most people. Mr Mendes said that he longed for respect. He wanted to be liked. He was influenced by their advice. He became an angry person.

With the passage of time he demonstrated a greater potential for irritability and unreasonable temper. He was disagreeable at home. On the soccer field he developed the reputation of an aggressive player. He went from being a well disciplined player to one who would react with aggression. He attracted many Red Cards whilst playing soccer. He had the worst Red Card record in the Wollongong league. He spoke of receiving two long suspensions one particular season. He played only two games during that season.

73That background, demonstrating a link between his drug use and aggression which was understood by the Applicant, and the fact that he had abstained from using ice for eight months prior to the incident in question, suggests that any use of drugs and alcohol on the day in question was a choice he made, and cannot be regarded as being mitigated by the fact that he had been introduced to drugs as a teenager. 

74In Stanford v R [2007] NSWCCA 73, Rothman J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hulme J agreed) said, when discussing the way intoxication should be dealt with:

[52]...The effect, if any, of the intoxication of an offender on the sentence to be imposed, or the culpability of the offence, has been dealt with by the courts on a number of occasions. 

[53]By and large, the cases fall within two classes. There are those classes of offences in which an offender has voluntarily embarked upon a course, for a range of reasons, which has led to his/her intoxication and then voluntarily embarked upon a course that is criminal conduct. High range PCA offences are the most obvious example. Dangerous driving where intoxication is an aggravating circumstance is another. 

...

[55]The principles were dealt with by this court in R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306. After discussing the effect of intoxication on the guilt or innocence of an accused, the Court dealt with the effect, if any, on sentencing. It said: 

""Only one matter of general principle was debated, and that was the extent to which the appellant was entitled to have his intoxication at the time of this offence taken into account in mitigation. The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account; such intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender's breach of the law. In some circumstances, it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated; in other circumstances, it may mitigate the crime because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character. (I have not intended by those examples to limit the extent to which intoxication may be taken into account: see, generally, Sewell and Walsh v R (1981) 29 SASR at 12 at 14-15; 5 A Crim R 204 at 207.) Where the reason for the offender's intoxication is a self-administered drug rather than alcohol, the cases suggest that that fact may well be more likely to aggravate than to mitigate."" (R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R at 327, per Hunt J, with whom Finlay and Allen JJ agreed).

75In the present case the intoxication came about from two self-administered drugs as well as alcohol. There was deliberation involved in both the drug-taking and the alcohol consumption, or at the very least recklessness. The statements made by the Applicant to Mr Glancey suggest that the ingestion of the drugs for the specific purpose of becoming aggressive was not out of character. In all of those circumstances far from the drug-taking being a mitigating factor, it was an aggravating one, although the Sentencing Judge did not specifically regard it as such. 

76In my opinion, if her Honour did err in considering the Applicant's intoxication she did so favourably to him. 

Ground 3 - No non-parole period for Count 2

77Section 45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 permits a Court to decline to set a non-parole period for an offence in particular circumstances, other than an offence set out in the table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Act. The offences in the table to Division 1A are offences carrying a standard non-parole period. Count 1 carried a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment. 

78The Crown accepts that the Sentencing Judge made an error in this regard. This ground should be upheld. 

Ground 4 - Totality
Ground 5 - Sentence manifestly excessive

79The Applicant submitted that although there was a very real need for an accumulation of the sentences, even a substantial accumulation, the Sentencing Judge had failed to have regard to the totality principle because of the common features involved in the attacks on the two victims. It was submitted that the Applicant was the same person in the same place at the same time and that the offending took place in the same circumstances. Bearing in mind those matters, an accumulation of three years between the first and second sentences had the result that the total sentence was manifestly excessive.

80What is being challenged, in asserting manifest excess, is a discretionary judgment: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]-[27]. Moreover, the appropriate way to consider any submission about manifest excess is to go to the salient facts of the case and assess them by reference to the maximum applicable sentence and any standard non-parole period: Way Zhen Wong v R [2010] NSWCCA 160 at [14]. 

81For reasons which will be given when this Court comes to re-sentence the Applicant, no error has been demonstrated in the approach taken by the Sentencing Judge to the principle of totality nor to the ultimate length of the sentences imposed. 
Re-sentence

82Error having been demonstrated in relation to Grounds 1 and 3 it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the Applicant. In my opinion, no lesser sentence is warranted than that imposed by the Sentencing Judge for the following reasons.

83First, for reasons given earlier, the Applicant's intoxication is not to be seen as a mitigating factor but should be regarded as an aggravating factor. The Applicant, not having used ice for a period of eight months, embarked upon its use and consumed almost an entire bottle of scotch during the course of the day. This must be regarded as self-induced intoxication at an age of rational choice which involves moral culpability for the predictable consequences of that choice: Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22 at [28]. 

84Secondly, as her Honour rightly observed, in respect of offences contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900, the result or consequences of the conduct in terms of the nature of the injury suffered determine the seriousness of the offence to a very significant degree: R v Mitchell, R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 at [27]; R v Jione [2007] NSWCCA 170 at [14]. In the present case the injuries, both physical and psychological, which resulted from the attacks were significant and continuing. Both victims have scars which will be permanent reminders of the offence. These injuries amply justified the Sentencing Judge's finding that the offences were within the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

85Thirdly, the Applicant told the police that he had carried the knife due to his being told it was dangerous in Sydney. He said at his sentencing hearing that he had experienced two attempted carjackings. His explanation for taking the knife to the room of the apartment was that it was his separating and cleaning device to be used in association with the consumption of drugs. That explanation had not been given either to the police or to Dr Westmore with whom he had discussed the carjackings. Particularly when the Applicant knew that the ingestion of ice caused him to become bad-tempered and aggressive, the carrying of the knife should be regarded as an aggravating factor.

86Fourthly, in relation to Ms Rugiano there were two, and possibly three, separate attacks upon her. He attacked her in the hotel room and endeavoured to throw her off the balcony. He stabbed her during that attack but she managed to make it down to the ground floor away from him. However, the Applicant, having followed her to the ground floor then chased and attacked her with the knife as she ran into Bathurst Street with Mr Paduch. He continued to attack her with the knife while she was on the ground. He then turned his attention to Mr Paduch. After inflicting the injuries upon Mr Paduch he returned to attack Ms Rugiano for a third time despite attempts by the passerby Ms Harman to prevent injury to Ms Rugiano. 

87Fifthly, although the Sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant was genuinely remorseful and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation, his drug use over a number of years and the changes that such drug use produced to his behaviour, meant that issues of personal and general deterrence as well as retribution loomed large in the consideration of the appropriate penalty. A lesser sentence than that imposed by the Sentencing Judge would not adequately demonstrate the disapproval that should be shown by the Court for the viciousness of the attacks perpetrated on the victims by the Applicant. 

88Finally, as to the accumulation of the sentences, although the attacks on both victims occurred at a similar time, that was true only to the limited extent that Ms Rugiano was again attacked when both victims were in Bathurst Street outside the hotel. Ms Rugiano experienced a prolonged attack in the hotel room where the Applicant not only attempted to throw her off the balcony but stabbed her as well and then chased her out of the room as she fled. 
89In addition, it seems that the attack was perpetrated on Mr Paduch merely because he had the misfortune to be present with Ms Rugiano in a way that caused the Applicant to become paranoid about his relationship with Ms Rugiano. Whilst it may have been appropriate for there to have been some concurrency between the sentences, there were two separate attacks on two different persons which resulted in serious injuries to each of those persons.

Conclusion

90Because of the error in not providing for a non-parole period for Count 2 it is necessary to uphold the appeal and to re-sentence the Applicant. No lesser sentence overall is warranted. In the circumstances it is appropriate to provide for a non-parole period of three years and nine months for Count 2 with an additional term of one year and three months. The sentence for Count 1 will commence, as the Sentencing Judge provided, three years after the sentence for Count 2 commences.

91In my opinion the following orders should be made:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Uphold the Appeal.

(3)Quash the sentences imposed upon the Applicant on 1 February 2008. In lieu, sentence the Applicant as follows:
(a) In respect of Count 2 - a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing 8 October 2006 expiring on 7 July 2010 with and additional term of one year and three months expiring on 7 October 2011
(b) In respect of Count 1 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 - a non-parole period of four years commencing 8 October 2009 and expiring on 7 October 2013 with an additional term of three years expiring on 7 October 2016.

2708031,R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.

2JOHNSON J: This is an appeal by the Crown under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentence imposed upon the Respondent, Tara Maree Speechley, by his Honour Judge Bennett SC at the Parramatta District Court on 3 February 2012.

3The Respondent pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated kidnapping contrary to s.86(2)(a) Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by imprisonment for 20 years. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence.

4The sentencing Judge imposed a term of imprisonment for a period of one year and 11 months and, pursuant to s.12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, suspended the execution of the sentence conditionally upon the Respondent entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for that period upon certain terms, including the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service. 

5A Notice of Appeal to this Court was filed by the Crown on 27 February 2012 and served upon the Respondent on 29 February 2012. 

Facts of Offence

6The Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge that on 2 May 2011 at Riverwood, she did, without consent, take and detain Mosa (Julius) Mbele with the intention of obtaining an advantage, to wit, to assault and intimidate him, while in the company of Jessica Aubourg and Jason Alford.

7A Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. In addition, the Respondent gave evidence. 

8What follows is drawn from the Statement of Facts which constituted the foundation for findings of fact made by the sentencing Judge. 

9The Respondent (then 19 years' old) was a close friend of the co-offender, Ms Aubourg. As at the date of the offence, Ms Aubourg was in a relationship with the second co-offender, Mr Alford. Ms Aubourg had previously been in a relationship with the victim, Mosa (Julius) Mbele. She told the Respondent that he had sexually assaulted her.

10On 2 May 2011, Ms Aubourg telephoned the victim and asked to meet him. She told him that she would bring a friend. At about 9.00 pm that night, the Respondent and Ms Aubourg drove to Bankstown to meet the victim. They were in Ms Aubourg's grandfather's motor vehicle, and they carried Mr Alford in the boot of the vehicle. Unbeknown to the Respondent, Mr Alford was in possession of a loaded 0.22 calibre shortened rifle.

11Ms Aubourg picked up the victim and he entered the rear of the vehicle, a two-door Hyundai. Ms Aubourg drove the vehicle to Belmore Road, Riverwood. At that stage, the victim became uneasy and he asked Ms Aubourg to pull over so that he could smoke a cigarette. The Respondent said to Ms Aubourg, ""Is this the guy that tried to rape you""? Ms Aubourg replied, ""Yes"". The victim said, ""What are you talking about? Stop playing games"". Ms Aubourg said, ""Don't worry about it"". The Respondent, Ms Aubourg and the victim got back into the car and Ms Aubourg drove to a location near Saltpan Reserve at Riverwood.

12Ms Aubourg opened the boot and then alighted from the vehicle. The victim was unable to exit the vehicle because the front seat was blocking his way. The victim heard the boot open and he then heard Mr Alford say, ""Hey fuckhead, don't move, don't even look at me"". The victim saw Mr Alford standing behind the vehicle holding a firearm. It was at this point that the Respondent became aware of the presence of the firearm. The firearm was pointed at the victim's head, through the open boot. The victim said, ""Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me"".

13The Respondent exited the vehicle, and she moved her seat forward, to enable the victim to leave the vehicle. As he attempted to do so, Ms Aubourg reached into the vehicle and attached a metal handcuff to the victim's left wrist. She pulled on the handcuff and the victim got out of the car. The victim then grabbed Ms Aubourg's wrist. 

14Mr Alford said to the victim ""You think this is not a real gun""?, whereupon he hit the barrel of the firearm against the top of the victim's head, causing the firearm to discharge.

15Mr Alford reloaded the firearm and said ""Should we cut his fingers off now""? The Respondent started to walk away. Mr Alford said to the Respondent, ""Tara, get the knife out of the boot"". The Respondent went to the boot of the vehicle and found a knife which she handed to Mr Alford.

16The victim then struggled with Ms Aubourg. He managed to break free and run away from the offenders. Mr Alford discharged the firearm into the air to frighten the victim, who ran to a nearby unit where a resident called the police.

17Ms Aubourg, Mr Alford and the Respondent re-entered the vehicle and drove around the area, attempting to locate the victim. In evidence during the sentencing proceedings, the Respondent said the purpose of this was to try to retrieve the handcuffs because they thought they would be in trouble if police found them. The three then made their way to Mr Alford's premises.

18On Tuesday 3 May 2011, Ms Aubourg attended Campsie Police Station where she was arrested and charged. In a recorded interview, she made partial admissions as to her involvement in the offence. She denied the use of a firearm and stated that Mr Alford was not involved in any way. Later that day, Ms Aubourg participated in an electronically recorded interview, during which she made full admissions. 

19The Respondent was then contacted by police. She attended Campsie Police Station where she provided a statement to police outlining her involvement in the offence, and was then allowed to leave.

20Police later executed a search warrant at Mr Alford's residence and located a short barrel rifle within the roof cavity of the premises. That rifle matched the description of the firearm which was given to them by the victim. Police also located 10 .22 calibre projectiles.

21The Respondent was arrested at her home on 5 May 2011. She participated in an electronically recorded interview. She discussed her involvement in the offence, revealing the following. 

22The Respondent told police that Ms Aubourg was her best friend. On the morning of 2 May 2011, Ms Aubourg disclosed that she had been sexually assaulted by the victim, and that she wanted to get back at him but did not quite know how to do so at the time. The Respondent then discussed the matter with Mr Alford resulting in a plan to take the victim and scare him to make him leave Ms Aubourg alone as he had been messaging and calling her. The Respondent said there was no conversation about weapons being involved. She and Mr Alford then discussed the plan with Ms Aubourg and they agreed together to get the victim in the car, take him to the park and scare him.

23The Respondent said that Ms Aubourg rang the victim and asked him to meet them. Ms Aubourg said to the victim that they were ""keen to go and have a threesome"" with him. She and Ms Aubourg got into the vehicle, and Mr Alford got into the boot. 

24The Respondent knew that there were poles and a baseball bat in the boot of the car. She did not know there was a firearm in the car. They then picked up the victim. On the way to the park, the victim admitted to Ms Aubourg that he had ""raped her"". At the park, Mr Alford held the gun through the hatch and told the victim not to move and that the gun was loaded. The Respondent stood there watching and did not know what to do.

25According to the Respondent, Ms Aubourg was told by Mr Alford to put the handcuffs on the victim's wrists. Ms Aubourg attempted to do so and got one handcuff on. At that stage, the victim grabbed Ms Aubourg's wrist. Mr Alford then struck the victim on the head with the rifle, and the rifle discharged. 

26The Respondent said that Mr Alford was telling the victim to get in the boot of the car. She said that Mr Alford also said that there was a knife in the car, and for her to get it. She did so and, at that point, the victim escaped and ran down the road. Mr Alford then fired a shot from the rifle to scare the victim, who kept running. 

27During the interview, the Respondent said that did not feel sorry for what happened because the victim should not have done what he did to her friend.

28Following her arrest and charging on 5 May 2011, the Respondent was granted conditional bail, upon which she remained until sentence was passed on 3 February 2012.

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances

29The Respondent was born in 1991 and was 19 years' old at the time of the offence and 20 years' old at the time of sentence. She has no prior criminal convictions.

30As mentioned earlier, the Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, as did her father. In addition, a presentence report was tendered, together with a report of Anthony Diment, consultant psychologist, dated 30 January 2012 and a number of character references. 

31The Respondent has a three-year old son who was not living with her at the time of the offence, but had returned to live with her at the time of sentence. The Respondent stated that she had used cannabis, including during the period when the offence occurred.

Grounds of Appeal

32The grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown are as follows:

(a) Ground 1 - His Honour erred in holding that the offence was aggravated by the use of only two weapons.

(b) Ground 2 - His Honour erred in failing to assess the objective seriousness of the offence.

(c) Ground 3 - His Honour erred in imposing a sentence that failed to reflect the objective gravity of the offence and was manifestly inadequate.

Remarks on Sentence

33To allow the grounds of appeal to be properly understood, it is appropriate to set out extracts from his Honour's remarks on sentence. 

34In doing so, it is necessary to keep in mind that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing on 3 February 2012. This course had the undoubted advantage that those present in Court could hear immediately the sentence which was passed and his Honour's reasons for passing that sentence. A consequence of this approach, which is understandable in a busy court, is that remarks on sentence may not be ""as robustly structured as they might otherwise have been"" (Simpson J in Simkhada v R [2010] NSWCCA 284 at [24]) and may ""lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing"" (Simpson J in Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 at [57]). 

35When considering whether error has been demonstrated in the ways alleged by the Crown, it will be necessary to fairly read his Honour's remarks on sentence, bearing in mind the features of an ex tempore decision.

36Following a recital of the facts of the offence, during which reference was made to the Respondent obtaining the knife from the car boot, his Honour turned to a number of discrete issues. Firstly, his Honour referred to the explanation and suggested motive for the offence (AB12):

""There is no evidence before me as to the nature of the sexual assault that Aubourg alleged, sufficient to have an appreciation of what she has alleged to have suffered. I was told from the bar table that there was a report of that matter to the police but I know nothing further about it.

Whether or not the matter was taken up by the police, or pursued with the police by the co-offender Aubourg, the court will not tolerate members of the community taking the law into their own hands. At this very point in the history of this city, hardly a week goes by without there being drive by shootings by those engaged upon acts of retaliation, following some earlier event causing some insult or offence, prompting these further serious episodes of misconduct. The court needs to make clear, that if someone is the victim of an offence, of whatever character, it is a matter to be brought to the attention of the authorities given responsibility for the investigation of such behaviour, and then for the authority given the responsibility for prosecuting the perpetrators of the misconduct to do so. It is not acceptable for any member of the community to engage on conduct such as that with which I am concerned.""

37His Honour then addressed the use of weapons, the subject of the first ground of appeal (AB12):

""The Crown correctly points out that this behaviour is aggravated by the use of a weapon. In this case, there were two weapons, in my assessment of the matter, the firearm which was discharged twice, once deliberately, and the handcuffs which were used in an attempt to secure the victim.""

38Reference was then made to the degree of planning (AB12):

There was planning but I do not take that into account as a factor in aggravation, drawing upon s 21 A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but I bring it to account, as part of the factual matrix, upon which to assess the gravity of this offence.""

39The sentencing Judge then turned to the Respondent's subjective circumstances, including the absence of any criminal history, the contents of character references and the presentence report together with the report of Mr Diment.
 
40His Honour accepted that the Respondent had demonstrated contrition (AB16-17):

""To her credit she acknowledged in the witness box that she was not sorry for her wrongdoing at the time or when she was interviewed by the police but that as time progressed she came to the realisation that what she did was serious and involved significant consequences for her.

The Crown suggests in her submissions that in these circumstances I would be circumspect when considering whether to accept her expressions of remorse to be genuine. I have come to the view that on balance at this point in the sequence of events the offender is appropriately contrite and I shall find accordingly.""

41The sentencing Judge made reference to the Respondent's background and upbringing, together with her youth and immaturity (AB17-18):

""I have brought to account that she was raised in circumstances that must have had a deleterious effect in her formative years with both parents addicted to heroin. Her mother and father appear to have done what they can to address their burden and have embarked upon methadone programs, and her mother has been working, but even so the parameters that ought to have been set as she was growing appear not to have been available to her and have, I believe, made some contribution to her attitude that ultimately led her to the decision to embark upon this offence. She is young and I believe she is immature and I accept that at the present time she is suffering from a depressive disorder of moderate proportion, borne of the cumulative effect of the stressors brought because of the dispute regarding her son, a foolish decision to embark upon this crime, the use of cannabis, which I accept is diminishing, and the fear of consequences that she now has to face.""

42The sentencing Judge then turned to the question of sentence, noting that the Crown and the Respondent's counsel had accepted that nothing less than a custodial sentence was appropriate (AB18):

""The Crown and Mr Taylor both concede that nothing less than a custodial sentence should be imposed in relation to this crime. The Crown concedes that there are special circumstances by reason of the offender's age, that this will be her first time in custody, and the circumstances of her son. Implicit in what the Crown has acknowledged is the need for the offender to have an extended period of time on parole to facilitate her rehabilitation, the prospects for which the Crown concedes are strong. I agree with those concessions and the observations that the Crown made leading to them.

First of all the question arises as to what is the appropriate sentence. Allowing her the discount of twenty five percent for the utility that her plea has provided would reduce what I believe to be the otherwise appropriate sentence of two years and six months to one year and eleven months; indeed it is a little less than that but I propose that the sentence should be one of one year eleven months.""

43His Honour then turned to the manner in which the sentence should be served (AB18-20):

""The next question to be determined is how should the sentence be served. The options are simply to incarcerate her with an appropriate non-parole period or refer her for assessment for her suitability to serve the sentence by way of an intensive correction order in the community.

Alternatively there is available the suspension of the sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which I am urged by Mr Taylor to consider. S 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act specifies the purposes for which sentences are imposed. They are to ensure adequate punishment for the offence and to prevent the crime by deterring the offender and others from committing similar offences. In this case general deterrence is a significant factor. As I made clear at the beginning the courts cannot tolerate this sort of response to what might be thought to have been a crime against another member of the community.

There is a need to protect the community from the offender; I do not believe that looms large in this exercise. There is the need to promote the rehabilitation of the offender and what is required in this case is to get her away from the use of cannabis, which is not a soft drug but one that puts the user at the risk of psychosis. The offender must be made accountable for her actions, the sentence must denounce her conduct and recognise the harm done to the victim. S 5(1) of the Act provides that I must not sentence her to imprisonment unless satisfied having considered all possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. As I have indicated I am satisfied that imprisonment is appropriate in this case; the question I have to determine is whether or not she should go into custody. It seems to me that the conduct upon which this offender engaged is comparable to that of the offender Aubourg, but something less than that of Alford. The co-offenders are yet to be dealt with; this is the first of the three offenders who is to be sentenced.

I propose to deal with the offender pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Stand up please and come forward. What you did was foolish and could have ended in tragedy that might have ended with you in the Supreme Court facing a much more serious charge than you are facing. You should understand that if you breach the bond that I am going to require you to enter you will be called back before me to face sentence. A sentence of imprisonment is there; I will have no choice depending upon the assessment of the nature of the breach but to send you to gaol. If you continue to use cannabis and if you are detected using cannabis during the term of this bond you will be going to gaol, do you have any question about that?""

44His Honour then proceeded to sentence the Respondent to a term of imprisonment of one year and 11 months, suspended pursuant to s.12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 conditionally upon the Respondent entering a bond to be of good behaviour for one year and 11 months from 3 February 2012. The bond was subject to conditions:

(a) that the Respondent be of good behaviour and appear before the Court if called upon to do so;

(b) that the Respondent continue to reside with her parents at Punchbowl;

(c) that the Respondent submit to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of that Service, including with respect to her use of cannabis;

(d) that the Respondent report to the Bankstown office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days to arrange for supervision.

Sentencing of Co-Offenders

45This Court was informed that Ms Aubourg's matter is listed for sentence at the Parramatta District Court on 26 June 2012, with Mr Alford's matter listed for sentence at the same Court on 17 August 2012.

46The Court is unaware whether Ms Aubourg and Mr Alford are charged with further offences apart from that for which the Respondent was sentenced. Whatever be the position, however, steps ought be taken to ensure, so far as it is reasonably possible, that these related offenders are sentenced by the same District Court Judge: Dwayhi v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; 205 A Crim R 274 at 284-286 [32]-[46].

Kidnapping Offences Under s.86 Crimes Act 1900

47It will assist an understanding of the grounds of appeal, and their resolution, to make some general observations concerning the offences contained in s.86 Crimes Act 1900.

48The offence for which the Respondent was sentenced lies within s.86 Crimes Act 1900, which provides as follows:

""86 Kidnapping

(1) Basic offence

A person who takes or detains a person, without the person's consent:

(a) with the intention of holding the person to ransom, or

(b) with the intention of obtaining any other advantage,

is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.

(2) Aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if:

(a) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in the company of another person or persons, or

(b) the person commits an offence under subsection (1) and at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim.

A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.

(3) Specially aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1):

(a) in the company of another person or persons, and

(b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm is occasioned to the alleged victim.

A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.

(4) Alternative verdicts

If on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (2) or (3) the jury is not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence charged, but is satisfied on the evidence that the accused is guilty of a lesser offence under this section, it may find the accused not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of the lesser offence, and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly.

(5) A person who takes or detains a child is to be treated as acting without the consent of the child.

(6) A person who takes or detains a child does not commit an offence under this section if:

(a) the person is the parent of the child or is acting with the consent of a parent of the child, and

(b) the person is not acting in contravention of any order of a court relating to the child.

(7) In this section:

child means a child under the age of 16 years.

detaining a person includes causing the person to remain where he or she is.

parent of a child means a person who has, in relation to the child, all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that, by law, parents have in relation to their children.

taking a person includes causing the person to accompany a person and causing the person to be taken.""

49The development of the law of kidnapping, commencing with the offence as understood at common law and then contained in s.90A Crimes Act 1900 before the enactment of s.86, was considered by Howie J in Davis v R [2006] NSWCCA 392 at [23]-[55]. 

50It will be observed immediately that the offences contained in s.86 extend beyond the traditional concept of kidnapping, involving the holding of a person for ransom. The concept of ""any other advantage"" in s.86(1)(b) (and previously in s.90A) has been interpreted broadly, extending (amongst other things) to psychological gratification or satisfaction: R v Rose [2003] NSWCCA 411. Indeed, the experience of the courts in recent years has been that the detention of a person for purposes other than for ransom has been the predominant scenario for offences under s.86. There have been regular examples of persons detained for advantage in the context of domestic violence incidents, or the taking of vigilante action in circumstances where it is believed that the detained person has committed some wrong against the offender, or persons associated with the offender. 

51Examples of s.86 offences committed in a domestic violence context include R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179, Heine v R [2008] NSWCCA 61, R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 and Jeffries v R [2008] NSWCCA 114; 185 A Crim R 500.

52Examples of s.86 cases involving what might be described as vigilante conduct include Williams v R [2006] NSWCCA 33; Barlow v R [2008] NSWCCA 96; 184 A Crim R 187 and R v Rayment [2010] NSWCCA 85; 200 A Crim R 48.

53The very breadth of conduct which is capable of falling within s.86 was noted in R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183, where Howie J at [43] doubted ""that offences under s 86 will be sufficiently homogenous that a reference to statistics alone will be of much assistance"".

54The gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing is the unlawful detaining of a person: R v Newell at [32]; R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 at [42]; R v Burton at [95]; Jeffries v R at 511 [79].

55Factors which bear upon an assessment of the seriousness of a basic offence under s.86(1) include the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention, although the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain is not conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence: R v Newell at [32]. 

56The statutory scheme of offences under s.86 is clear enough. 

57The basic offence is contained in s.86(1). 

58An aggravated offence under s.86(2) will be committed if the offender is in the company of another person or persons or the offender occasions actual bodily harm to the victim at the time of, or immediately before or after the commission of the offence. 

59The specially aggravated offence under s.86(3) will be committed if the offender is both in company of another person or persons and occasions actual bodily harm to the victim at the time of, or immediately before or after the commission of the offence.

60The statutory scheme recognises that a kidnapping offence committed in company is more serious because of the force of numbers deployed against the victim, as is a kidnapping offence where the victim sustains actual bodily harm in the context of the offence.

61The meaning of the term ""in company"" in provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 has been considered: R v Leoni [1999] NSWCCA 14 at [16]; R v Villar and Zugecic [2004] NSWCCA 302 at [68]; R v Button and Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159; 54 NSWLR 455 at 464 [120]. The victim is confronted by the combined force of two or more persons who share a common purpose.

62The threshold for ""actual bodily harm"" is relatively low. Injury need not be permanent, but must be more than merely transient or trifling, with bruises and scratches to a victim being typical examples of injuries which constitute actual bodily harm: McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305;198 A Crim R 549 at 558 [44]. 

63It will be observed that s.86 does not nominate other circumstances of aggravation, such as the offender being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument at the time of the offence: cf s.105A Crimes Act 1900 and s.112 Crimes Act 1900. 

64Clearly, offences under s.86(1), (2) or (3) may be further aggravated when committed in circumstances which attract one or more aggravating factors contained in s.21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or any other common law factor which may bear upon the objective gravity of the offence itself. In this case, the involvement of a weapon or weapons arises for consideration: s.21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Ground 1 - His Honour Erred in Holding that the Offence was Aggravated by the Use of Only Two Weapons

65This ground of appeal is based upon the finding by the sentencing Judge set out at [37] above.

Submissions

66The Crown submits that his Honour referred only to the firearm and the handcuffs and left out any reference to the knife, being the very weapon which the Respondent had given to Mr Alford following his request to the Respondent. It was submitted by the Crown that this omission was significant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the Respondent's crime so that its omission was important.

67Mr Stratton SC, for the Respondent, submitted that the sentencing Judge's finding that the handcuffs were used as a weapon was a generous one in favour of the Crown. With respect to the knife, he submitted that the Statement of Facts was somewhat ambiguous, but that it appeared that the victim had in fact escaped whilst the Respondent was looking for the knife and that there was no evidence before the sentencing Judge that the victim saw the knife or that it was used against him.

68Mr Stratton SC submitted that his Honour's finding was clearly open in the circumstances of the case. 

Decision

69Section 21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 nominates as an aggravating factor, to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the fact that ""the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon"". The term ""weapon"" is not defined in that Act. 

70The ordinary meaning of the word ""weapon"" includes ""any instrument for use in attack or defence in combat, fighting, or war, as a sword, rifle, cannon etc"" and ""anything serving as an instrument for making or repelling an attack"". Clearly, an otherwise innocuous item, such as a walking stick or a bottle, may fall within this provision if the relevant offence involved the actual or threatened use of either of those items as a weapon. Handcuffs may be capable of use as a weapon depending upon the actual or threatened use in the particular case. 

71Here, Ms Aubourg attached the handcuff to the left wrist of the victim for the purpose of restraining him as he attempted to leave the vehicle. It may have been more appropriate to characterise the use of the handcuffs as an instrument of restraint rather than as a weapon. However, that is not the issue raised by this ground of appeal. 

72The agreed facts stated that Mr Alford said ""Should we cut his fingers off now?"" with the Respondent starting to walk away, and Mr Alford then saying ""Tara, get the knife out of the boot"". The Respondent then went to the boot and found a knife which she handed to Mr Alford. In my view, the appropriate (and only reasonably open) finding was that the victim was present when these words were said and the knife was produced, but that the victim then struggled with Ms Aubourg, broke free and ran away from the scene. At this point, Mr Alford discharged the firearm into the air to frighten the victim.

73A finding ought to have been made that the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a knife (as well as the firearm), with this issue being one of particular significance to the assessment of objective gravity of the Respondent's offence.

74The issue is whether the experienced sentencing Judge in this case failed to have regard to the Respondent's obtaining of the knife as an aggravating factor, even though his Honour had recited these events shortly before in his summary of the facts. 

75Clearly, express reference ought to have been made to the knife in the recital of aggravating factors. However, in the context of ex tempore reasons delivered on the day of the sentencing hearing at which the knife was expressly mentioned, I am not persuaded that his Honour overlooked the use of the knife or its operation as an aggravating factor on sentence. 

Ground 2 - His Honour Erred in Failing to Assess the Objective Seriousness of the Offence

Submissions

76Whilst acknowledging that the sentencing Judge had summarised the facts of the offence, the Crown submitted that his Honour had erred in failing to assess the objective gravity of the offence. The failure to assess the objective gravity of the offence, it was submitted, was accompanied here by undue attention being paid to persuasive subjective considerations: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 

77The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had not assessed the seriousness of the offence by reference to factors identified by Howie J in R v Newell, including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. 

78The Crown submitted that this error on the part of the sentencing Judge gave rise to the imposition of a sentence complained of further in Ground 3.

79Mr Stratton SC submitted that the sentencing Judge went to great lengths to set out the objective circumstances of the offence, and then expressed conclusions which constituted an effective finding with respect to the objective gravity of the Respondent's crime.

80It was submitted for the Respondent that the determination that a custodial sentence was necessary demonstrated that a conclusion was reached and applied as to the objective gravity of the offence.
 
Decision

81Offences under s.86 have no applicable standard non-parole period. Accordingly, an assessment of objective seriousness relevant to that class of offence (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120) has no application to this case.

82However, an assessment of objective gravity is an important part of the sentencing function with respect to all offences. In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL, I said at [46]:

""The process of instinctive synthesis to be undertaken by a sentencing court involves the sentencing judge identifying all the factors that are relevant to the sentence and then making a value judgment as to is the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 377-378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen at 1162 [26]. Assessment of the objective gravity of an offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]. It is an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis, a purpose of which is the imposition of a proportionate sentence, which adequately punishes an offender: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""

83A classic statement of this general principle is that of this Court (Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J) in R v Dodd at [354]:

""As Jordan CJ pointed out in R v Geddes (36 SR at 556), making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime, as Veen v The Queen No 2 (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 472 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category. The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features of a case will vary. (See, for example, the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 quoted in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64). Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case (R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594). We consider that to have happened here. In our view the requirement of a reasonable proportionality with the circumstances of the crime called for a significant full-time custodial sentence.""

84Counsel appearing for the Respondent in the District Court had addressed the objective gravity of the offence by reference to the factors mentioned by Roden J in R v Collett and Robson (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 7 June 1979) (AB72) although no express submission was advanced as to the degree of objective gravity of the offence.

85In the District Court, the Crown pointed to what were said to be aggravating features of the offence without also descending to a submission as to the level of objective gravity of the offence, although it was contended that no penalty other than a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate in the circumstances of the case (AB74).

86I have made all due allowance for the ex tempore nature of his Honour's remarks on sentence. It is implicit in his Honour's conclusions that the Respondent's offence was of such a degree of objective gravity that a custodial sentence only was appropriate. However, it was, at the least, highly desirable that an assessment of objective gravity, expressed shortly by reference to the factors referred to in R v Newell, ought to have been stated by his Honour. 

87In the result, I am not persuaded that patent error has been demonstrated as contended by the Crown under this ground of appeal. The gravamen of the Crown's complaint is essentially that contended for under Ground 3, to which I will now turn.

Ground 3 - His Honour Erred by Failing to Impose a Sentence that Reflected the Objective Gravity of the Offence and was Manifestly Inadequate

Submissions

88The Crown submitted that an appropriate finding of objective gravity for this offence, once made, would lead to the necessity for a sentence of full-time imprisonment to be imposed. 

89In this respect, the Crown pointed to what was said to be the careful planning of the kidnapping, the fact that the Respondent knew that there were at least poles and a baseball bat in the boot of the car, the fact that (although the Respondent did not know there was a firearm in the boot of the car) once Mr Alford produced it, and struck the victim over the head with it, the Respondent remained involved in the enterprise, the duration of the detention (at least a number of minutes) in circumstances of what must have been extreme fear for the victim, the occurrence of the offence in the late evening and in a place not known to the victim, the production of three weapons (the firearm, knife and handcuffs) and the fact that others were available (the baseball bat and poles), the Respondent's ability to locate a knife readily in the boot of the car once requested by Mr Alford and the fact that the detention only ended because the victim managed to escape and continued to run away, despite the fact that Mr Alford discharged the firearm again at that point. It was submitted that, if the intention was to scare the victim, then that had already been well and truly done. 

90The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had substantially underestimated the objective gravity of the Respondent's offence, and her culpability, in the characterisation of her offence as ""foolish"" (see [41] and [43] above). 

91The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence was to be taken into account in the selection of the manner of performance of the sentence and that a court, in choosing an alternative to full-time custody, cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative chosen, the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [28].

92It was submitted that the selection of a sentence of one year and 11 months indicated that the sentencing Judge had commenced his process of reasoning from the starting point that the sentence to be imposed upon the Respondent was to be suspended: R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 at [52].

93In circumstances where the maximum penalty for an offence under s.86(2) was imprisonment for 20 years, the Crown submitted that the sentence imposed, in all the circumstances of this case, was unreasonable or plainly unjust so that the Crown appeal should be allowed, the sentence quashed and the Respondent resentenced.

94Mr Stratton SC submitted that this offence lay towards the lower end of the scale of objective gravity. In this regard, he relied upon an examination of factors referred to by Roden J in R v Collett and Robson. By reference to these factors, it was submitted:

(a) length of detention - the period of detention was for a few minutes (and not days, weeks or months);

(b) the extent to which fear or terror was occasioned in the detainee and the manner in which he was treated - it was submitted that the only injury suffered by the victim here was a blow to the head;

(c) the purpose of the detention - the purpose was to scare and not to harm or ransom the victim;

(d) whether there are persons who were subjected to anguish through fear for the well-being of the detainee (as in cases of holding for ransom or holding hostages) - no third parties were put through anguish in this case.

95Mr Stratton SC submitted that the Respondent had a strong subjective case, including no prior convictions and a finding of contrition.

96In response to the Crown submission concerning the selection of the length of sentence, Mr Stratton SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had allowed a 25% discount for the Respondent's plea so that the starting point was in the order of two years and six months. Reliance was placed upon sentencing statistics of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in support of the submission that the sentence imposed upon the Respondent was within the discretionary range on the facts of the case, and that the Crown had not established the contrary.

Decision

97It is appropriate to assess the objective gravity of the Respondent's offence for the purpose of determining this ground of appeal.

98The elements of the offence under s.86(2), admitted by the Respondent's plea, included the detention of the victim whilst the Respondent was in company with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely assaulting and intimidating the victim. This was not a case of a bare intention to scare the victim. By her plea, the Respondent admitted an intention that the victim be assaulted and intimidated, as indeed he was.

99I note that no victim impact statement was placed before the District Court on sentence, although the fear instilled in the victim is readily apparent from a description of the offence.

100It is the case that Ms Aubourg and Mr Alford were the prime movers with respect to the offence. It was Ms Aubourg who informed the Respondent that she had been sexually assaulted by the victim. It was Mr Alford who, once informed of this, determined to kidnap the victim and to assault him. Mr Alford was aware of the availability of a firearm, a knife and other items contained in the boot of the car. On the evidence, the Respondent had no knowledge of the presence of the firearm or the knife until the kidnapping was well underway.

101Although Ms Aubourg and Mr Alford were the prime participants in the crime, the Respondent was not a mere bystander on the sidelines of the offence. The Respondent had discussions with Ms Aubourg and Mr Alford before the offence and was aware of the plan to kidnap the victim. The Respondent committed the offence in company so that the victim was confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons who shared a common purpose (see [61] above). The Respondent was present with the requisite intent and she physically participated in the offence by obtaining the knife when asked by Mr Alford to do so. When the victim had earlier pleaded ""Please don't hurt me, I'm a good person"", the Respondent replied ""You're not a good person. You deserve everything you get for what you've done to Jessica"" (AB61.21).

102The fact that the Respondent was aware that a baseball bat and poles were in the boot of the car supported a finding that she knew that objects may be used as part of the process of intimidating and assaulting the victim. 

103The fact that the Respondent did not, in some way, seek to remove herself from the event once the firearm was produced by Mr Alford and discharged does not assist her, although the practical reality was that events moved very quickly in what was undoubtedly a volatile and fluid situation. These factors, of course, made it all the more risky when weapons were being used for the purpose of assault and intimidation. 

104The Respondent complied with Mr Alford's request to obtain the knife from the boot of the car and returned with it, no doubt in the knowledge that it was to be used in a manner adverse to the victim's interests. The fact that the victim broke free and escaped at that time was fortuitous for his captors, including the Respondent.

105This Court has observed that the movement away from s.90A, and the enactment of the offences now contained in s.86, reinforces the need to concentrate upon s.86 (and cases which have applied it) in the assessment of factors bearing upon the objective gravity of kidnapping offences: Jeffries v R at 511 [79]. That does not mean that factors mentioned in R v Collett and Robson are to be placed entirely to one side. As is apparent, a number of the factors identified in that case are relevant to kidnapping offences generally. However, the statutory structure of s.86 is different to that previously contained in s.90A Crimes Act 1900, as will be demonstrated shortly by reference to the submissions made for the Respondent. 

106Firstly, the length of time of detention is always relevant. However, this is not a case where the victim was released by his captors. Rather, as the level of intimidation escalated, he broke free and fled in circumstances involving an irresistible inference of extreme fear on his part. The relative brevity of the period of detention is of limited assistance to the Respondent in an assessment of objective gravity.

107Secondly, the extent to which fear or terror was occasioned, and the manner in which the victim was treated, operated to elevate the objective gravity of this crime. As Mr Stratton SC conceded during argument, the absence of injury to the victim (beyond the blow to the head) cannot assist the Respondent in an assessment of objective gravity of an offence under s.86(2)(a) Crimes Act 1900. If it was the case that actual bodily harm had been occasioned to the victim in this case, then the Respondent would have been liable to conviction and sentence for an offence of specially aggravated kidnapping under s.86(3) of the Act. It should be kept in mind that the threshold of ""actual bodily harm"" is relatively low (see [62] above). 

108In assessing the objective gravity of a s.86(2)(a) offence, it would be erroneous to have regard to the absence of a feature which, if it were present, would constitute a different and more serious offence under s.86(3) of the Act: R v Burton at [90]. It is this particular feature which renders reliance upon R v Collett and Robson problematic in an assessment of objective gravity of a s.86 offence. 

109It is true that the purpose of the detention in this case was not ransom. However, this Court has rejected a submission that holding a victim to ransom is the most serious form of offence under s.86: R v Newell at [31]-[32]; Jeffries v R at 511 [80]. The purpose of the detention in this case was to assault and intimidate the victim. It went beyond mere scaring, although this was an undoubted consequence of the victim's ordeal. 

110As mentioned earlier, offences under s.86 committed as a form of vigilante action have come fairly regularly before the criminal courts. It has been necessary for courts to take into account the need to condemn actions of this type and to reflect general deterrence on sentence. At the same time, motivation of this type is capable of bearing in other ways on the determination of sentence.

111In Barlow v R, McClellan CJ at CL said at 189 [2]:

""The offence committed by the applicant was serious. Motivated by the wrong she believed was previously done to her and accompanied by a male friend, she took the law into her own hands. The victim was punched, dragged, hit with kitchen tongs and threatened with death and generally put in terror for at least two hours. Whatever be the crime committed by the victim, a civilised society cannot condone such conduct. The rule of law requires that offenders be tried by the appropriate authorities and, if convicted, punished in accordance with accepted principle. In our society crime is dealt with by the courts.""

 
112In the same case, Hall J (McClellan CJ at CL and Price J agreeing) said at 195 [40]:

""The nature of the conduct by the applicant could be correctly identified in the remarks on sentence as having been in the nature of 'vigilante' conduct. The seriousness of the offence in question, despite the purpose or motivation having been revenge for the alleged sexual assault by the victim upon her some six years before, involved a deliberate course of conduct, in company with another, whereby the applicant decided to act outside the law in seeking retribution for what she alleged had been done to her by the victim. Such conduct, as the sentencing judge correctly identified, is the antithesis of what is required in a society based on the rule of law and is to be denounced in the strongest terms.""

113Later in Barlow v R, Hall J referred to other decisions of this Court where considerations of this type have arisen (at 200-201 [67]-[68]):

""67 In Regina v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47, the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that where the motivation for an offence is retaliation for prior sexual abuse and to prevent abuse of others, the need for personal deterrence and protection of the community is considerably lessened, unless prior offences indicate that the behaviour is not isolated. Spigelman CJ observed at [33]:- 

'Where the stated motive for the offence was retaliation for prior sexual abuse and to prevent the abuse of others, it would be relevant if this was the only such offence committed by the Applicant. Then it could be said that the need for personal deterrence and protection of the community was considerably lessened, because the act of retaliation was unlikely to be repeated against the particular victim and also because of the fact that it was the crime now under consideration that led to the victim eventually being charged in the manner set out above.'

68 In Regina v Mitchell; Regina v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296, the Court of Criminal Appeal, in accepting that it was a relevant factor that the respondents believed that the victim had been guilty of sexual activity in relation to one of them, observed the following, per Howie J at [30] - [32]:-

'... But a grievance with the conduct of another, whether justified or not, cannot be a license to commit crime even where the conduct alleged by the victim is one of sexual assault. In the circumstances of the present case the motive of the respondents for assaulting the victim was of limited mitigating value.

The relevance of motive will vary depending upon the particular facts of the case. It may explain why the offence was committed without condoning or excusing it. The more serious the offence committed the less weight that can be given to motive as a mitigating factor, even if it might otherwise have had that effect. But as was pointed out in Swan, the existence of motive is relevant to other factors that may impact upon the sentencing discretion. In this case, particularly with respect to the respondent Gallagher, it partly explains why he committed such a serious offence notwithstanding that he had no prior criminal record and was otherwise considered a person of good character, apart from his use of illicit drugs. The existence of the motive indicated that in his case there was no need for personal deterrence. 

...

It may to some degree mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence yet indicate the need for a more severe sentence in order to address issues of deterrence'.""

114The principles in Barlow v R, R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 and R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 were also applied in R v Rayment at 67-69 [105]-[108].

115How do these considerations operate in this case? It is clear that the Respondent was motivated to commit this crime as a form of punitive response for the victim's sexual assault of her friend (which the Respondent believed had occurred). The Respondent has no prior criminal history. Although the Respondent has had problems with the use and abuse of cannabis, it seems reasonable to approach the question of sentence here upon the basis that she would not have become involved in this form of criminality, but for her misplaced concern for her friend. As Howie J observed in R v Mitchell at 101-102 [30]-[32], the more serious the offence committed, the less weight that can be given to motive as a mitigating factor, even if it might otherwise have had that effect. However, as Howie J further observed, the existence of motive is relevant to other factors that may impact upon the sentencing discretion, by explaining why the Respondent committed such a serious offence notwithstanding that she had no prior criminal record, and was otherwise considered a person of good character apart from her use of cannabis. In these circumstances, the existence of the Respondent's motive may indicate that there is no need for personal deterrence. 

116Consideration has been given to the appropriateness of a suspended sentence for an offence under s.86 Crimes Act 1900. That a non-custodial sentence or suspended sentence will generally not be appropriate for a s.86(2) offence was made clear in R v Anforth [2003] NSWCCA 222. In most exceptional circumstances involving misguided motives and the commission of a s.86(3) offence by a person with no prior convictions where cultural mores played a part, it was accepted that all the objectives of sentencing could be met by the imposition of a suspended term of imprisonment: R v Davis [2004] NSWCCA 310 at [26]. In Barlow v R, on appeal from a sentence of full-time imprisonment, Hall J at 196-203 [49]-[81] considered whether a suspended sentence may have been appropriate, but ultimately rejected grounds of appeal which asserted error in not suspending the sentence.

117I do not accept the Respondent's submission that this offence under s.86(2)(a) lay towards the lower end of the scale of objective gravity for s.86(2) offences. This was an offence of significant objective gravity, well above the lower end of the scale.

118The Crown submission based upon the sentencing Judge's use of the term ""foolish"" does not, in my view, advance the matter very far. Plain speaking by judicial officers in remarks on sentence should not be discouraged. The principal purpose of remarks on sentence is to provide an oral explanation to the offender, the victim and persons in court at the time when sentence is being passed, as well as informing the community and an appellate court of the reasons for imposition of the sentence: R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 at [29]-[30]. 

119At times, sentencing Judges may characterise offending conduct by use of terms such as ""stupid"" or ""foolish"". Whether the particular label is apt will, of course, depend upon the circumstances of the case. If there is no greater articulation of the objective gravity of the offence, there is a risk that the use of such a term may downplay or underestimate the objective seriousness of the crime: R v Gaudry [2010] NSWCCA 70 at [47]-[48]; R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at 584 [63].

120In the circumstances of this case, I take the use of the term ""foolish"" by the sentencing Judge as being a reflection of the involvement of the Respondent, a young woman with no prior convictions, in a serious crime which could well have escalated into even more serious crime. I do not consider that the use of the term in this case bespeaks error.

121Nor am I persuaded that error is demonstrated in this case by the duration of the sentence which was ultimately passed.

122The resolution of this ground of appeal ultimately involves an assessment of whether the sentence imposed upon the Respondent was unreasonable or plainly unjust so as to be manifestly inadequate. This was a crime of significant gravity committed by a young and immature woman, who would not have been in this position but for her misguided loyalty to her friend which drew her into serious criminality. It was also necessary that the sentence reflect the need for denunciation and general deterrence, as resort to vigilante action as a response to some misconduct or crime committed (or believed to have been committed) by the victim is to be severely discouraged: Barlow v R at 189 [2], 195 [40]; R v Rayment at 67-68 [106]. The Respondent had a strong subjective case with an indication to the sentencing Judge that she had learned from this experience.

123It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case), the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her own discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. Nor is appellate intervention on the ground of manifest inadequacy justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]. In this case, the Crown contends that there is a latent error giving rise to a manifestly inadequate sentence.

124Although the length of sentence imposed upon the Respondent lay within the range of sentence reasonably open to the sentencing Judge for this crime, I am satisfied that the suspension of the sentence resulted in the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence. By choosing to suspend the sentence, the punishment was deprived of much of its effectiveness and did not reflect the objective gravity of the offence: R v Zamagias at [28], [32]. The sentence was clearly disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offence, even after making due allowance for the Respondent's subjective case.

125I would uphold this ground of appeal. 

Discretionary Factors and Conclusion

126If error was demonstrated, Mr Stratton SC submitted that this Court, in the exercise of discretion, should not resentence the Respondent.

127It has been said that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons, so that this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s.5D, has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36 at 39 [1]-[2].

128This discretion may be exercised for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 24 [92], 25 [95], 33 [150].

129In determining whether or not the discretion should be exercised, it is open to the Court to receive evidence of what has happened between the time of sentence and the hearing of the appeal: R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; 176 A Crim R 1 at 8 [28].

130At the hearing of the appeal on 12 June 2012, Mr Stratton SC read an affidavit of the Respondent affirmed that day on the question of discretion and resentence. The affidavit had not been filed or served in advance of the appeal. Discussion ensued during the hearing, culminating in leave being granted for the Respondent to file and serve an updated affidavit that day (given indications that the earlier affidavit was not up to date). Leave was also granted to the Crown to file and serve an affidavit in reply by 15 June 2012, with the Court to convene thereafter if necessary to hear any evidence and submissions arising from the affidavits. 

131A further and more detailed affidavit of the Respondent, also affirmed on 12 June 2012, was filed and served. The Crown filed and served an affidavit of Carolyn Griffiths sworn 15 June 2012 in response to the affidavits of the Respondent.

132A non-controversial aspect of the Respondent's affidavits of 12 June 2012 was her statement that she continued to live at home with her mother and had begun a stable relationship with a new partner and had settled into a normal routine of being a mother to her three-year old son, with the child's father having access every second weekend. 

133However, controversial areas of the Respondent's affidavits involved her statements concerning her attendance at a hairdressing course and her undertaking treatment with a psychologist, Ms Ida Shapievsky. 

134The presentence report before the District Court stated that the Respondent had received a Certificate II in hairdressing in 2008 and had worked as a hairdresser for two months after leaving school, leaving when she became pregnant. 

135The Respondent's second (and more considered) affidavit affirmed 12 June 2012 (made after the hearing on that day) stated that she had begun a full-time hairdressing course on 4 June 2012, which occupied Monday to Thursday of each week, and that she had ""gone every day, except one day when I was sick"". 

136The affidavit of Ms Griffiths confirmed that the Respondent had enrolled as a full-time student in Certificate III in hairdressing and in a Diploma of Hairdressing Salon Management, being courses which commenced on 4 June 2012 and were scheduled to be completed on 17 September 2013. The course involved attendance on Mondays to Thursdays with 28 hours' study per week. A letter obtained from the relevant educational institution stated that the Respondent had attended on 4 June 2012 for student orientation, but had not attended since, with a paper rollcall being marked and recorded for each group twice daily, and with each student being placed on a rollcall according to their session group. It was said that there was no paper or electronic record of the Respondent having contacted the college with a reason for her non-attendance.

137In the Respondent's second affidavit on 12 June 2012, she stated that she had commenced treatment with Ms Shapievsky, psychologist, in late March 2012 and had ""seen her twice, each time for one hour"". In a letter dated 14 June 2012, Ms Shapievsky stated that the Respondent had attended the initial consultation on 20 March 2012 with follow-up consultations being scheduled for 10 April, 17 April, 26 April, 3 May, 15 May and 30 May 2012 with the Respondent not attending any of these further sessions.

138In view of the conflict between the Respondent's affidavits and the evidence contained in the affidavit of Ms Griffiths, the Court resumed the hearing of the appeal on 20 June 2012. The Respondent was cross-examined on her earlier affidavits and a further affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 20 June 2012 was read.

139In the affidavit of 20 June 2012, the Respondent stated, with respect to the hairdressing course, that she had attended on 4 June 2012 and 7 June 2012 (she was unsure why her name was not marked off on the rollcall for that day), but that the students were advised on 4 June 2012 that the course program had not been finalised, so it was not necessary to attend on 5 and 6 June 2012. 

140With respect to her attendance upon Ms Shapievsky, the Respondent stated that she attended an additional follow-up session after the initial consultation and that there were further sessions scheduled, however they fell over the Easter period and were cancelled by the psychologist. She stated that the rescheduled sessions during May 2012 were cancelled by herself as they conflicted with her requirement to report to the Probation and Parole Service and she requested alternate dates from Ms Shapievsky, but no further appointments had yet been made.

141Under cross-examination by the Crown, the Respondent stated that she did not have a clear understanding of these matters at the times when she affirmed her affidavits of 12 June 2012. She stated that she had a lot on her mind at different points and that this had affected her ability to give accurate accounts of these matters.

142Under cross-examination, the Respondent agreed that she had not reported on all occasions as required to the Probation and Parole Service and that she had received a warning letter which stated that, if three warning letters were issued, breach action would be initiated against her with respect to the bond.

143By reference to the affidavits and oral evidence of the Respondent given on 20 June 2012, the Crown submitted that the Court would not be satisfied that the Respondent had made real efforts towards her rehabilitation in the period since sentence was passed in the District Court, and that she had not been frank with the Court. 

144Mr Stratton SC submitted that it would be open to the Court to conclude that the Respondent was not a reliable historian with respect to these matters, but that the evidence confirmed that she had enrolled in the hairdressing course and had attended at least once upon the psychologist. He submitted that the Court should conclude that the Respondent still manifested signs of youth and immaturity and was also subject to the demands of raising a three-year old child. He emphasised that there had been no further offence committed whilst the Respondent was subject to the bond.

145I have concluded that error has been demonstrated by the Crown in the sentence imposed on the Respondent on 3 February 2012. Accordingly, the occasion arises for the Court to consider whether, in the exercise of residual discretion, it should determine not to interfere and to leave in place the suspended sentence and bond ordered in the District Court.

146From time to time, this Court has declined to resentence an offender on a Crown appeal, despite error having been established, because of solid and substantial evidence of rehabilitative steps taken by the offender between the time of sentence and the hearing of the appeal: R v Tortell [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [63]; R v SC [2008] NSWCCA 29 at [55]. In such circumstances, it may be seen that the offender has taken full advantage of opportunities for rehabilitation which have presented themselves as a result of an erroneous and unduly lenient sentence. Depending upon the circumstances of the case, the residual discretion may be exercised in favour of the offender with the Court dismissing the Crown appeal. Of course, in those circumstances, the judgment of this Court will still serve the primary purpose of Crown appeals referred to at [127] above.

147The Respondent was given a very significant opportunity, as a result of the suspended sentence imposed on 3 February 2012, to demonstrate strict compliance with the terms of her bond and the taking of steps to advance her rehabilitation. There was a reasonable expectation that she would be full and frank, in any evidence to be provided to this Court at the hearing of the Crown appeal, concerning the steps she had taken since sentence was passed. 

148The most favourable view of the Respondent's approach towards her affidavits and evidence in this Court is that she has demonstrated less than enthusiastic efforts to comply with the terms of her bond and, more significantly, a capacity to provide self-serving and misleading accounts concerning action which she had taken.

149I have sought to make allowances for the youth and relative immaturity of the Respondent and the other demands in her life of which she has spoken. However, I have concluded that the Respondent has not demonstrated the taking of significant rehabilitative steps, in a way that should lead this Court to have confidence in her.

150It is true, as Mr Stratton SC submitted, that there has been no allegation that she has committed a further offence whilst subject to the bond. The difficulties for the Respondent, however, lie in the different areas to which I have adverted.

151Having considered the submissions made in the context of the somewhat unusual scenario which developed in this Court, I have reached the view that the Court should not decline to resentence the Respondent, in the exercise of the Court's residual discretion. A manifestly inadequate sentence was imposed in the District Court. The appropriate course is that the Court should allow the Crown appeal and resentence the Respondent. 

152It is necessary to consider the appropriate sentence which ought be imposed in the circumstances of this case. I am satisfied that the sentence of imprisonment imposed in the District Court of one year and 11 months ought be fixed. As the Respondent has been subject to the suspended sentence and bond since 3 February 2012, it is appropriate to direct that the sentence commence from that date.

153As his Honour determined to suspend the sentence, it was not necessary for the sentencing Judge to specify a non-parole period. As a full-time sentence of imprisonment ought now be imposed, it is necessary for the Court to consider that issue. I am satisfied that ""special circumstances"" should be found so as to vary the statutory ratio under s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. These circumstances include the fact that the Respondent has care of a three-year old child, a factor (amongst others) accepted by the sentencing Judge if ""special circumstances"" were to be considered on sentence in that Court (see [42] above). 

154A non-parole period of 12 months is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. That non-parole period will date from 3 February 2012.

155I propose the following orders:

(a) Crown appeal allowed;

(b) quash the sentence passed at the Parramatta District Court on 3 February 2012 with respect to the Respondent;

(c) for the offence of aggravated kidnapping under s.86(2)(a) Crimes Act 1900, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 3 February 2012 and expiring on 2 February 2013, with a balance of term of 11 months commencing on 3 February 2013 and expiring on 2 January 2014;

(d) pursuant to s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, direct the release of the Respondent on parole at the end of the non-parole period on 2 February 2013.

156HAMMERSCHLAG J: I agree with Johnson J.

		28 June 2012",2012-06-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708064,R v Petrovski; R v Abdallah; R v Atanovski; [2012] NSWDC 168,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Appearing for sentence today are three drug dealers, Dobre Petrovski, Tony Atanasovski and Michael Abdallah. Their sentence proceedings were heard together because Petrovski is a co-offender with Atanasovski and Abdallah, although the latter two are not co-offenders with each other. Three other drug dealers should be mentioned who were not part of the present proceedings - Adel Mustafa, who I sentenced in December last year; Done Romanov, sentenced by Chief Judge Blanch in November last year; and Leon Candarakis, sentenced by Judge Toner in February this year. 

2The proceedings involving the present three offenders were heard together in order that a proper appreciation of the roles played by each offender could be ascertained. Both this Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal have commented in the past upon the undesirability of co-offenders being dealt with separately. Often enough, where co-offenders are dealt with in separate proceedings, each blames the other and it comes about that each offender is sentenced on the basis that his or her co-offender was the more culpable because of the different evidence submitted in the separate proceedings. An example of this problem can be found in the circumstance that Romanov was dealt with separately from Peskovski. When sentencing Romanov Justice Blanch, clearly on the evidence before him, found that Peskovski was ""a major dealer of prohibited drugs"". However, the evidence before me, clearly different to the evidence before his Honour, did not satisfy me that that description was accurate.

3Notwithstanding some confusion at the commencement of these proceedings, I have endeavoured to ascertain the role played by each offender, and compare their relative culpability based on the evidence before me, with the obvious qualification flowing from the fact that, as I have mentioned earlier Atanasovski and Abdallah were not co-offenders in the offence.

4Now is perhaps the appropriate time to mention that I have taken into account the principle of parity in formulating appropriate sentences for each of these offenders. No offender should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence he has received with those of his co-offenders. Of course, no two co-offenders are alike, and especially in this case, each of the people involved performed different roles with different levels of involvement and moral culpability. I have borne those differences in mind, and so should the offenders when they compare the sentences they receive with the sentences imposed on the others.

5The charges faced by each offender arise out of a controlled operation undertaken by police. A man by the name of John Gray provided information to police and began working for them. Also involved in the controlled operation was an undercover police officer, using the name ""Mick."" 

6On 25 March 2010 Gray met with Peskovski. At this meeting, Peskovski said that he was able to supply Gray with large quantities of cocaine. A couple of weeks later Gray and Mick went to Peskovski's home. There Peskovski agreed to supply one ounce of cocaine as a sample prior to the supply of a larger quantity. The transaction whereby Peskovski supplied Mick with 26.6 grams of cocaine, for which Mick paid $8,250 in cash then took place. This is an offence of supplying cocaine, for which the offender is to be sentenced.

7A few days later, following a number of telephone calls, Mick and Gray went to a hotel as directed by Peskovski. They met him there and Peskovski supplied Mick with .2 of a gram of cocaine as a sample, saying that he had a much larger quantity of that particular drug available for supply. No payment was made for that sample. That is an offence of supplying cocaine which appears on a Form 1, which I am to take into account when sentencing the offender for the next matter I will describe.

8On 22 April 2010, Peskovski and Gray had a number of telephone conversations as a result of which Peskovski, Gray and Mick met a number of times at various locations in Sydney. At one of those meetings, Peskovski offered to supply Mick with five ounces of cocaine to come from Atanasovski. Mick and Gray thus went to Atanasovski's premises where they discussed the supply of cocaine by Atanasovski. Atanasovski told them he could not supply any cocaine but agreed to supply some in the future. I will deal with the offence that Atanasovski faces in relation to this conduct later, but as far as Peskovski is concerned that conduct represented an attempt to supply five ounces of cocaine.

9On 2 June he made a further attempt, this time trying to supply ten ounces of cocaine. In the events that followed, Peskovski attempted to involve himself in the supply by Atanasovski, who eventually told him that he was unable to supply the ten ounces which had been requested. The co-offender Candarakis was also involved in that particular activity. 

10Thereafter, further discussions ensued which culminated in Peskovski involving himself in the supply by Kellie Murray to Mick of 253.1 grams of cocaine on 10 June 2010. In the lead up to that actual supply of that commercial quantity of cocaine, Peskovski had many conversations with both Murray, Mick and Gray. Although he was not a principal, Peskovski was clearly significantly involved in the arrangements.

11Then on 17 June 2010, there was the further supply of a further commercial quantity of cocaine this time 251 grams. This offence involved Romanov and Abdallah. On 17 June Peskovski and Mick went to Abdallah's home. Peskovski told Mick that Abdallah was able to supply sixteen ounces of cocaine. Mick handed Abdallah $63,000 in cash and received 251 grams of cocaine from him. Once more, Peskovski was significantly involved in the arrangements, was present at the time the transaction actually took place and indeed sampled a small amount of the cocaine as the transaction was taking place.

12Peskovski is forty-three years old. He gave evidence in these proceedings. His evidence was very difficult to follow, not only because his evidence was given through an interpreter and because the answers did not appear to be responsive to the questions asked of him, but also because of the way the Crown and Ms Pullinger put the matter before me, (not disclosing until proceedings were well advanced the names of those working for police, and that these were in fact Gray and Mick who Peskovski had been referring to in his evidence).

13There appeared ultimately to be only two matters in dispute. In particular, Peskovski suggested that some of the drugs he supplied came from Gray. His evidence-in-chief was not at all convincing, and I found it impossible to believe much of what he said, but in any case, cross-examination of him revealed that his recorded conversations with Gray during the transaction were quite inconsistent with the explanation he offered in his evidence. I do not accept that the source of any of the drugs supplied by Peskovski was Gray.

14Nor do I accept that he was in dire financial circumstances. The offender gave evidence that as a result of being told by Gray that his life was in danger because he owed money to bikies, he lent money to Gray which the latter was supposed to repay. Peskovski himself borrowed money at an exorbitant rate of interest, which meant that by the time the offences commenced he was owed by Gray $78,000. He gave evidence that it was Gray's suggestion that he get involved in drug supply as a means of recouping his loss.

15So, rather than write off his loss he decided to become a drug supplier to make money. Ms Pullinger, who appeared for Peskovski, went so far as to say that being owed $78,000 and being in poor financial circumstances amounted to duress. I do not accept that at all. Firstly, I do not accept that he was in dire financial circumstances, and even if he was that scarcely provides any justification at all for the offender doing what he did. 

16Whether or not his financial position was poor, it is undoubtedly the case that he committed these offences for financial gain. Although he may have been a drug user he was not a drug addict. He is in that worst category of offender, a person who involved themselves in the trade of drugs simply to make money.

17The offender has an unremarkable background. There is nothing to indicate why he would seek drug trafficking as a means of getting out of any financial difficulties he perceived himself to be in. Although he has a minor criminal history there are no drug matters on it. 

18The offender was born in Macedonia and came to Australia at the age of seventeen in 1986. Gray, who is married to his cousin, picked him up from the airport upon his arrival and the two had a lot to do with each other over the ensuing years. This may be a partial explanation as to why he would deal in drugs when approached to do so by Gray. He married and has two sons. Both of them clearly love their father and have written letters in support of him, which were tendered before me. 

19He is now divorced from his former wife and is in a relationship with a woman he met at the Macedonian Club at Yagoona. She too is supportive of him. He was working before his arrest on this matter and gave evidence that there will be work available to him upon his release from custody. He hopes to resume living with his partner. He has expressed his remorse for his involvement in these offences, although some of the evidence that he gave, which I found to be unbelievable suggests that he is not totally contrite for what he has done. 

20He no doubt had some difficult times after his marriage broke down and the evidence would suggest that he is currently depressed. That is not terribly surprising, given that he is incarcerated and facing a significant term of imprisonment.

21It is significant that all of Peskovski's drug dealing activities involved two people, Mick and Gray, who were working for the police, and Gray was a member of his family who had been very kind to him in the past. There is no evidence that Peskovski was involved in any other drug supplies apart from these in the period over which the offending occurred extended only from 13 April to 17 June. 

22It is also significant that from 17 June until his arrest on 8 December, some months passed without any other offending. In many cases, if not most, drug suppliers only stop supplying drugs when they are arrested. That is not the case with Peskovski.

23As with all the others for sentence today, it is a matter of minor mitigation that none of the drugs actually supplied were disseminated to drug users in the community because of the police involvement. The harm to the community was less because of that circumstance, but of course the moral culpability of the offenders is not reduced at all. They certainly intended that the drugs were disseminated to drug users. 

24Peskovski pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and thus the sentence I will impose upon him is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

25It is conceded, of course, that a custodial sentence is required. Peskovski has been in Australia for many years, but needs the assistance of an interpreter for some communications in English. Thus, to some extent, he will serve his sentence harder than would be the case for a person who is easily able to communicate with other prisoners and the authorities. He will also be affected by the circumstance that whilst he is custody he is separated from his family and partner.

26The offender is doing his best to make the most of his time in custody, studying and working as well. He will benefit from an extended period of supervision upon his release to parole, and so I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour. 

27Clearly the principle of totality applies to Peskovski and his co-offenders because of the number of offences they committed. There needs to be due recognition of the fact that each offence was a separate aspect of the offender's criminality, and thus deserving of further punishment. On the other hand, the sentence I impose should, in an overall sense, reflect the overall position concerning each offender. For that reason, in most cases there will be partial accumulation of sentences for the separate acts of criminality.

28For Peskovski as well as the others to be sentenced today, I take into account both the maximum penalties and, where appropriate, the standard non-parole periods for these offences. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period for any offences which carry standard non-parole periods are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

29Tony Atanasovski is to be sentenced for one offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine, two offences of offering to supply a commercial quantity of cocaine, one offence of possessing an unauthorised firearm (which was a replica not capable of firing any projectile and thus is a relatively minor matter) and one offence of obtaining money by deception. When I sentence him for the first of those matters, that is, the actual supply of 449 and a half grams of cocaine, he asks that I take into account nine matters on a Form 1; one further matter relating to the unauthorised firearm, in that he did not keep that firearm safely; a matter of possessing prohibited drug; and seven offences of obtaining money by deception, which are part of the same activity, as the substantive offence of obtaining money by deception.

30On 22 April Gray went to Atanasovski's home and raised with him the possibility of Atanasovski supplying him with cocaine. The offender was then introduced to Mick. The three of them further discussed the supply of cocaine to Mick with Atanasovski telling him how much he could supply and how much notice he would need. 

31On 6 May Gray met with Atanasovski and the latter agreed to supply sixteen ounces of cocaine for $8,500 per ounce. Further conversations involving other offenders, (Bradvica and Candarakis), took place where it was agreed that the cocaine would be handed over in three separate lots. Pursuant to that agreement, Candarakis supplied five ounces of cocaine to Mick in exchange for $45,000 cash and later on a further quantity of eleven ounces of cocaine for $51,000 cash. Mick gave $7,500 to Atanasovski before leaving the premises, thus in total 449.5 grams of cocaine were supplied.

32On 2 June 2010 Gray and Atanasovski had a number of conversations, the upshot of which was that Atanasovski would supply Mick with ten ounces of cocaine at 3.30 that afternoon. However, when Atanasovski rang Bradvica to obtain the cocaine, he was told that the latter was unable to supply the cocaine until the following day. That deal fell through. 

33There was then a substantial gap until early December 2010. Once more Mick met Atanasovski who told him that he was about to meet a big supplier. Mick was then introduced to Mustafa, who offered to supply him with twenty-five ounces of cocaine for a total price of $275,000. Mick agreed to buy the cocaine on those terms. It was agreed that Atanasovski would be paid $12,500 for his part in the transaction, which was to take place on 8 December. That transaction never took place because Mustafa was arrested beforehand. When arrested, he was found to be in possession of 697.06 grams of cocaine. It was this quantity of cocaine that Atanasovski had agreed to supply. That supply would clearly have taken place were it not for the intervention of police.

34Atanasovski was arrested at the same time, and the imitation firearm was discovered along with a small quantity of cocaine, the subject of the possess prohibited drug on the Form 1, and two sets of digital scales. 

35Seemingly unrelated to the offender's drug supply activities he was also involved in fraudulent withdrawals from a bank totalling $80,000. On eight separate occasions Atanasovski went into the Commonwealth Bank at Hurstville, and presented a withdrawal slip for the withdrawal of $10,000 cash from a bank account held by Mr Mendo Mirceski. The statement of facts records that the accused ""has presented the withdrawal slip to the bank teller and presented a fraudulent New South Wales driver's licence, in the name of Mendo Mirceski, which contained a photo of the accused."" Although that statement of facts has been signed by a barrister, Mr George Thomas, apparently on behalf of the offender, in a document tendered to the Court Atanasovski denies that he had such a driver's licence in his possession. As it does not make any difference to the resulting sentence, I do not propose to attempt to resolve this factual dispute. It is clear that the offender was involved in a scheme to defraud the Commonwealth Bank of $80,000 and he succeeded in that endeavour.

36Like his co-offenders, the offender has some matters on his criminal history but nothing approaching the seriousness of these offences. He was actually on a bond for his latter offences, that bond having been imposed for a high range PCA matter in August 2010. 

37He also pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity so I will impose upon him a sentence which is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. The offender was, and continues to be in prison, a hard worker. He was involved in finance, and was successful for a while, but went bankrupt following the global financial crisis of a few years ago. He turned to drugs and alcohol at a stage of life when he was depressed, part of that depression of course coming about because of the failure of his business. 

38As with Peskovski, his motivation committing these offences was financial. He wanted to make money and involving himself in the supply of drugs seems to have been a way in which he could make significant sums of money.

39He was certainly not a principal in the drug deals. It seems to be agreed between the parties that he facilitated the supply of drugs by bringing the purchaser and the supplier together. As is obvious from the substantial gap between June and December, he was not a person who regularly conducted himself in this manner. He only got involved in drug supply transactions on occasions when he was contacted by people working for the police. 

40Atanasovski is fifty-one years of age and has three children. He too has been married but is now separated from his wife. Before things went downhill for him, he seemed to have been quite successful, running a business with fifteen employees and living in a large beach house. He began to drink from around February 2009, and his marital situation was of course strained by his declining financial situation and his abuse of alcohol. His wife left him in November 2009, not too long before he began to commit these offences. 

41He told a forensic psychiatrist that 2010 was a bit of a blur for him, in which he used drugs and alcohol to excess. He was, it seems, quite depressed at the time of these offences.

42A number of testimonials were tendered. I have to say however that the value of these testimonials is somewhat diminished because the referees appear to be unaware of what he actually did. Thus the one from Mr Brown referred to the offender's ""misdemeanour"" whilst others referred to ""drug possession."" 

43Notwithstanding the substantial quantity of the drugs involved in Atanasovski's offences, it is important to bear in mind the role that he played. As I mentioned, it seems to be agreed between the parties that the offender was a facilitator or go-between, consistent with that role, it appears that the amount that he himself was to be paid, was much less than ten per cent of the purchase price.

44Another matter in Atanasovski's favour concerns his mental state at the time of these offences. Dr Furst suggested that the presence of Mr Atanasovski's depressive illness during the period of the offences in question before the Court, mitigates against the seriousness of his actions as he was not coping well, exercising poor judgment and may have been more easily influenced by his associates. His judgment was probably affected by his chronic abuse of alcohol and cocaine at the time in question. The stressors in his life followed the collapse of his business and separation from his wife. The period of offending coincided with a low point in his life.

45As with the others the offender does have prospects of rehabilitation but a lot will depend on whether he gives up drugs, and perhaps also excessive consumption of alcohol, upon his release from custody. He has been attending drug and alcohol counselling whilst in custody and appears motivated to change. 

46There are special circumstances in his case. Both he and the community, will be assisted by him being supervised for an extended period upon parole.

47Finally we come to Mr Abdallah, the most serious of the offenders today. Although he was involved with Peskovski in the first of the offences I will describe, he committed the remainder independently. He committed a total of five serious offences of commercial drug supply, involving the actual supply of more than a kilogram of cocaine, and he would have supplied a further half kilogram were it not for the intervention of police.

48On 17 June 2010, as I described when dealing with Mr Peskovski, Mick and Peskovski went independently to Abdallah's home, having previously made arrangements for Mick to be supplied with sixteen ounces of cocaine. Mick and Peskovski went to a cabana at the rear of Abdallah's premises. Mick introduced himself to Abdallah and Romanov, who was also there, and after a short conversation gave Abdallah $63,000. There was a bag containing 250 grams of cocaine nearby. Peskovski sampled a small amount of that cocaine before retying the bag and handing it to Abdallah, who in turn handed it to Mick. Peskovski and Mick then drove away.

49On 26 October 2010, Mick and Gray went to a car park in Casula, where they met Abdallah. Arrangements were made for the supply of ten ounces of cocaine at $7,500 per ounce on 3 November. Pursuant to that agreement, Mick went to Abdallah's home where, in exchange for $75,000 in cash, he received 280.2 grams of cocaine. During that meeting, Abdallah agreed to supply Mick with a further ten ounces of cocaine on 17 November. On that date, once more Mick went to Abdallah's home. On this occasion, Mick handed over $70,000 in cash and received 280.8 grams of cocaine. An agreement was then reached that Abdallah would supply Mick with a further ten ounces of cocaine on 1 December. 

50On that date once more at Abdallah's home, Abdallah supplied Mick with 279.2 grams of cocaine, in exchange for $70,000. They also agreed that the next supply would take place on 8 December. On that day before he could actually supply Mick with 560.1 grams of cocaine, he was arrested. Police found that quantity of cocaine in Abdallah's possession, as well as three sets of scales, two bags of Glucoden and freezer bags. 

51Police also discovered a large quantity of cash, (which was clearly the proceeds of crime, given that Abdallah and his wife were in receipt of Centrelink payments at the time of the offences), and a pistol, with its serial number defaced, and ammunition.

52The offender is thus to be sentenced for five offences of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine, dealing with the proceeds of crime and possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm. When I sentenced him for that last matter, he asked me to take into account two matters on a Form 1; namely, possessing a firearm with a serial number missing, and possessing ammunition.

53The offender is fifty-one years of age. He also has matters on his criminal history for less serious offending than this and in particular, like the others here today, has never been convicted of any offence relating to drugs. 

54The offender is the oldest of six children, born in Australia to parents who emigrated to Australia. His father was a successful builder until he went to gaol for drug offences in 1985 when Mr Abdallah was nineteen. He thus became head of the family, and it was his responsibility to work to support his younger siblings. He became something of a property developer. He bought a house in 1984, which was renovated, and then went on to build blocks of units. He appears to have done very well for himself. He is qualified as a mechanic too, and whilst in custody he looks after the various motorised equipment, such as ride-on mowers and the like.

55He married in 2004 and has two daughters. Evidence was put before me of the offender's very lengthy problems with drugs. He has caused his wife and daughters no end of misery because of his substance abuse. He began drug taking at the age of fifteen when he started smoking cannabis, he then tried ecstasy, abused anabolic steroids whilst a bodybuilder before finally commencing to use heroin when he was aged twenty-nine. Once he started he has been unable, apart from some relatively brief periods, to stop until he was incarcerated on the present charges. 

56His wife, Sylvana prepared an affidavit which set out the offender's heart-breaking history of drug use. The affidavit details the various attempts at rehabilitation, their successes and their failures as well. The low point was obviously on 8 December 2008 when Mr Abdallah overdosed. His wife rang for an ambulance and was instructed how to administer CPR over the telephone. One of his daughters assisted by opening the gates for the ambulance to get in. He survived. One might have thought that that experience would be a powerful incentive for him to remain drug free, but he was only able to go a month without using drugs before relapsing once more.

57The offender's wife says she had no idea that he was supplying drugs. Some might think that she is mad to continue to support him, but it is to her enormous credit that she did not give up on the offender many years ago.

58Although the offender was a drug user at the time he was a drug dealer, this was far from the case where the offender could only obtain his drugs by drug supply. Because of his success as a property developer, he and his family lived a life which could actually be described as ""well off"", and he had plenty of ways that he could get money to buy drugs other than through supplying them. He did not want to do that, however. At least part of the motivation he had in deciding to supply drugs was to keep the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed.

59The offender pleaded guilty and has assisted the authorities. The details of what he has done will not be set out in this judgment. They are contained within an exhibit. I am able to say however that the assistance has been valuable and he has taken steps which have led to members of the community being protected from the possibility of injury or even death. 

60Although the plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity, and followed after committal for trial and negotiations between the parties, at no stage did the prosecution have to prepare the matter for trial. In view of the pleas of guilty and the assistance, the sentence that I will impose the offender is thirty-five per cent less than it otherwise would have been.

61The offender must necessarily go to gaol for a long time. Whilst he is drug free at present there is, given his lengthy problems with drugs, no guarantee that he will not relapse in the future, and thus although he does have prospects of rehabilitation, I cannot say they are good. He is progressing in the right direction, now off drugs and expressing his remorse for what he has done in the past, but a lot will depend on what happens when he gets out of gaol. 

62He does have an employment opportunity upon his release, and he is working whilst in custody in a position of some responsibility.

63Of course, one of the most important factors in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon an offender who has supplied concerns the offender's role. Whilst he may have played a more limited role in relation to the offence committed on 17 June 2010, in relation to the other offences, no submission could or was put to a similar effect. 

64There is no doubt that the offender's longstanding drug addiction was a significant factor in him committing these offences. One of the terrible things about drug addiction is the effect it has on the addicts themselves. It is not uncommon for addicts to lose, to a very significant degree, a proper appreciation of right and wrong. It is almost certain that the offender would not have committed these offences were he not himself a drug addict, but what I have just said does not only work in the offender's favour. What happened to Mr Abdallah is precisely the sort of thing that happens to people who would have used the drugs he supplied. The misery which he has caused his family is replicated throughout the wider community, which is precisely why drug supply offences are regarded as seriously as they are. 

65Quite clearly, the offender will need substantial support upon his release from custody given the length of his problems with drugs. Once more therefore I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour.

66The offender is using his time in custody wisely. In submissions he was described as a ""model prisoner"", which seems to be an accurate description of his behaviour in custody. 

67The offender was clearly emotional while giving evidence when he spoke about the effect of misconduct on his family. Perhaps at long last the realisation of what he has done to them might be a factor in him finally putting his drug use behind him. 
Mr Peskovski, for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on 13 April 2010, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two years, to date from 8 December 2010. 
For the two attempts of supplying prohibited drug, one of which was a commercial quantity committed on 22 April 2010, and 2 June 2010, I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 8 December 2011. 
For the two supply commercial quantity of prohibited drugs offences, committed on 10 June and 17 June 2010, I impose a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence - a total sentence of four and a half years, to date from 8 June 2012.

68Mr Peskovski, I will tell you the overall effect of that sentence. The overall sentence you must serve consists of a non-parole period of three and a half years, with a total sentence of six years, and the most important date that you want to know about is the date that you are eligible to be released to parole. That date is 7 June 2014.

69Mr Atanasovski, for the offence of obtaining money by deception, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment from one year, to date from 8 December 2010. 
For the offence of possessing an unauthorised firearm, you are dealt with under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, on 6 May 2010, you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years, to date from 8 June 2011. 
For the offence of offering to supply a commercial quantity of cocaine on 2 June 2010, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of eighteen months, to date from 8 June 2011. 
For the offence of offering to supply a commercial quantity of cocaine between 1 and 8 December 2010, you are sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months, to date from 8 June 2012 with a head sentence of three and a half years. 

70Thus, your overall sentence consists of a non-parole period of three years, with a total sentence of five years, and you are eligible to be released to parole on 7 December 2013.

71Mr Abdallah, for the offence of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime, you are sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of six months, to date from 8 December 2010. 
For the offence of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm, I set a fixed term of imprisonment for two years, to date from 8 December 2010. 
For the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine on 17 June 2010, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 8 December 2011. 
For the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine on 3 November 2010, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of three years to date from 8 June 2012. 
For the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine on 17 November 2010, I set a fixed term of imprisonment for three years to date from 8 December 2012. 
For the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine on 1 December 2010 I set a fixed term of imprisonment for three years to date from 8 June 2013.
And for the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine on 8 December 2010, I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 8 December 2013 with a head sentence of six years. 

72Thus, the non-parole period will expire on 7 December 2016, with the overall sentence being an effective non-parole period of six years, with a head sentence of nine years.

2708072,JACKSON v MAZZAFERO [2012] NSWCA 170,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
2HOEBEN JA:  Nature of proceedingsBy Statement of Claim filed 2 June 2009 the appellant sued the respondents for injury she received on 3 December 2007 when she fell in the entrance area of commercial premises owned by the respondents, fracturing her left wrist.
3In their Defence, the respondents admitted ownership of the premises and that they owed a duty of care to the appellant, but did not admit injury and loss and pleaded contributory negligence, intoxication and obvious risk.
4The matter was heard by McLoughlin DCJ on 6 - 7 September and 19 November 2010.  His Honour handed down judgment on 10 February 2011.  His Honour found in favour of the appellant and entered judgment  for $173,707.
5The judgment was made up of the following components:
(i) Non-economic loss - 26 percent - $40,000.(ii) Past out-of-pocket expenses - $17,832.00(iii) Past economic loss - $42,000.(iv) Past superannuation loss - $4,620.(v) Future economic loss - $30,000.(vi) Future superannuation loss - $3,300.(vii) Past domestic assistance - $13,455.(viii) Past lawn mowing - $2,500.(ix) Future domestic assistance - (lawn mowing) - $10,000.(x) Future domestic assistance generally - $10,000.
6The appellant appeals against the quantum of damages awarded by his Honour.  Specifically, the appellant challenges the damages awarded under the following heads:  Non-economic loss, past economic loss, future economic loss, future domestic assistance and future out-of-pocket expenses.
Factual background
7The appellant was born in January 1950 and except for a short period in the 1970's when she was caring for her children, worked as a registered nurse for over 40 years.  At the time of the accident, the appellant was divorced and living on her own in a three bedroom townhouse that had a small garden.
8The appellant commenced working in the orthopaedic ward at the Bankstown Hospital as a registered nurse in 1988.  In 2007 the appellant was working 30 hours per week in that ward.  Over the years she suffered some back injuries and developed an anxiety condition, particularly after the death of her mother in 2003.  Despite this, the appellant remained in employment.
9In July 2007 she had a fall and fractured her right wrist.  She went off work and did not return until October 2007.  Upon her return to work, she was working 20 hours per week in the orthopaedic ward, but had negotiated with her employer to return to 30 hours per week in January 2008.  On 3 December 2007 she had the fall which was the subject of these proceedings.  She once again went off work.
10As a result of the fall, the appellant suffered a severely comminuted fracture of her left wrist which required internal and external fixation.  The fixators were removed in January 2008.  Thereafter the appellant was diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (regional pain syndrome) in relation to her left wrist.  This condition produced changes in temperature and colour and pain.  The condition gradually resolved.  
11The appellant became anxious and depressed about her situation, particularly with regard to whether or not she would be able to return to work.  She underwent psychological treatment and was placed on medication which assisted her with her anxiety.  By the date of the trial, his Honour found that her psychological difficulties caused by the fall had largely resolved.
12The appellant returned to work on 26 May 2008.  Because she was unable to perform the heavy lifting work required in the orthopaedic ward, she was transferred to the neonatal ward.  In the neonatal ward, the appellant worked 24 hours per week or 30 hours per week, depending on the roster.
13For approximately six months after the fall, the plaintiff received assistance in relation to her housework from a friend, Ms Zieba, and her daughter.  At the time of trial, the appellant had engaged a commercial lawn mowing service because she was not able to perform that activity.
Findings of trial judge
14His Honour accepted the appellant as a witness of truth.  He found that had the injury to the appellant's left wrist not occurred, she would have returned to the orthopaedic ward, working 30 hours per week, in January 2008.  He found that as a result of the injury to her left wrist, she was not able to return to work in the orthopaedic ward.
15His Honour found that the appellant had suffered a significant injury with psychological sequelae, although the psychological sequelae had abated.  He found that there was a real possibility that the appellant would come to further surgery in the future, in the nature of a wrist joint arthrodesis.  His Honour found that the arthritis in the left wrist was either caused or significantly exacerbated by the injury and would continue to worsen.  His Honour found that it was ""probably unlikely"" that the surgery would occur in the next five years.
16The appellant complained of left shoulder problems, which had developed after the injury to her left wrist, but which had become asymptomatic by the time of trial.  His Honour concluded that the shoulder problem ""may or may not be related to this accident, I make no finding in that respect"".
Non-economic loss
17Having reviewed the medical evidence, his Honour said:
""I recognise the plaintiff's age in the assessment of general damages pursuant to the Civil Liability Act, however, the plaintiff has had significant restriction imposed upon her ability to lead a life within her home, a social life and a working life with some associated fears now abated in relation to that injury.  I assess the plaintiff's injury pursuant to the Civil Liability Act as some 26 percent of a most serious case.""  (RAB 50R).
18The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in his assessment of non-economic loss because he had failed to take into account the prospect of future deterioration, in particular that there was a real possibility that she would require further surgery, because the arthritis in her wrist would worsen.
19The appellant then reviewed the various features of her injury, i.e. the reflex sympathetic dystrophy, the pain from arthritis in the wrist joint, and the lifting restriction on any weight beyond 7 kgs.  She referred to the opinions of Dr Dave, the treating orthopaedic surgeon, and Dr Deveridge, another orthopaedic surgeon as to those matters.  The appellant also referred to the adjustment disorder and anxiety state which had developed following the injury, which she accepted had resolved by the date of the trial.
20The appellant submitted that his Honour should have found that the shoulder injury was caused by the fall.  In failing to make that finding, the appellant submitted, his Honour had failed to take into account a significant feature of the appellant's injuries, even though she accepted that the shoulder condition was asymptomatic at the time of trial.  By reference to those matters the appellant submitted that his Honour's assessment of Non-economic Loss was plainly inadequate.
21The principles relevant to a challenge to an assessment of non-economic loss were set out in Basha v Vocational Capacity Centre Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 409 at [101] by McColl JA (with whom Tobias JA and McClellan CJ at CL agreed) as follows:
""101 The challenge to the primary judge's conclusion on non-economic loss must be determined in accordance with the principles explained in Wynn Tresidder Management v Barkho [2009] NSWCA 149 (per McColl JA, Tobias and Young JJA agreeing):
""110 The approach taken when an appellate court is asked to review a primary judge's conclusion as to the severity of a plaintiff's non-economic loss by reference to a 'most extreme case' was discussed in Crystal Wall Pty Ltd v Pham [2005] NSWCA 449 (at [49]) as follows:
'49  The exercise in which the primary judge was involved in determining non-economic loss is neither scientific nor normative. While it is not wholly at large, it involves an exercise of discretion with which the Court will rarely intervene: Southgate v Waterford (1990) 21 NSWLR 427 at 440. Having regard to the nature of the exercise, a finding that a particular case is or is not 'a most extreme case' has been said to be not 'readily ... susceptible of appellate review' as 'its resolution ... involve[s] questions of fact and degree, and matters of opinion, impression, speculation and estimation calling for the exercise of common sense and judgment': Dell v Dalton (1991) 23 NSWLR 528 at 533 per Handley JA (with whom Kirby P and Priestley JA agreed); Rabay v Bristow [2005] NSWCA 199 at [62] - [67]. Unless it can be demonstrated that the trial judge has erred in the application of principle, in order to attract appellate review it will be necessary to show that the conclusion reached by the primary judge was manifestly erroneous: Ellis v Rantzos (t/as Rantzos Hairdressing) [2005] NSWCA 266 at [43] per Basten JA (with whom Handley and Santow JJA agreed).'
111 A like approach has been taken by the West Australian Court of Appeal: see Hammond Worthington v Da Silva [2006] WASCA 180; Den Hoedt v Barwick [2006] WASCA 196; (2006) 46 MVR 30; Insurance Commission of Western Australia v Weatherall [2007] WASCA 264"".
22His Honour clearly had in mind all of the disabilities identified by the appellant in her submissions (except for the shoulder) because his assessment of non-economic loss followed a comprehensive review of the content of the medical reports.  All of the features of the disabilities, to which the appellant drew attention, were in the quotations which his Honour included in his review of the medical evidence.
23Even if his Honour had not specifically referred to every disability flowing from the fall, this would not provide a basis for interfering with his Honour's assessment.  As the passage from Pham makes clear, an assessment of non-economic loss while needing to be based on evidence is an essentially impressionistic and discretionary exercise.
24The question of whether the appellant suffered an injury to her shoulder which was related to the accident is not easily resolved.  The general practitioner, Dr Petroulias, who saw the appellant on a number of occasions was only prepared to say that there ""may"" be a causal relationship between the appellant's complaints of pain in the shoulder and the fall.  Her treating orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Dave, who also saw the appellant on many occasions, did not record any history of the shoulder pain following the removal of the fixators.  If she had complained of shoulder pain at that time he would almost certainly have noted it.  Dr Dave was meticulous in recording complaints by the appellant and observations made by him of her condition.
25Dr Deveridge, who saw the appellant once in January 2009, attributed the pain in the shoulder to the accident but in so doing, relied entirely upon what he was told by the appellant.  In those circumstances, his Honour was not obliged to take the shoulder injury into account when assessing the appellant's damages.
26Even if his Honour were in error in not taking account of the shoulder injury in his assessment of non-economic loss, the injury itself was relatively minor when measured against the other disabilities caused to the appellant by the fall.  On the appellant's history, pain in the shoulder did not develop until the fixators were removed in January 2008.  Dr Deveridge recorded that by January 2009 there was no pain in the left shoulder.
27I am satisfied that the assessment of 26 percent of a most extreme case was well within the range of assessments of non-economic loss for the appellant.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Past economic loss
28The appellant challenged his Honour's assessment of past economic loss on the basis that insufficient reasons had been provided by his Honour and that his Honour's assessment was against the weight of evidence.
29As the above schedule of damages makes clear, the past economic loss component was made up of three parts - the 22 weeks immediately following the fall, the loss of long service leave and a buffer to cover the remaining elements of the appellant's claim for past economic loss.  His Honour set out his reasons for those calculations as follows:
""The first difficulty to arise in relation to past economic loss is the plaintiff at the time had returned to orthopaedic duties, working twenty hours per week and no doubt would have increased those hours.  She returned to work at the end of May 2008 in the neo-natal ward, was commencing to work on twenty hours per week and that work has then varied between either thirty hour shifts per week or twenty four hour shifts per week.  There is no real evidence to indicate that the work in the orthopaedic ward would not produce shifts of the same duration.  That is a difficulty in relation to the determination of the plaintiff's loss because of this injury.
The other factor is that there is a claim made for the plaintiff's loss of payments, being the nurse in charge of the ward.  While some qualification is obtained within the submissions by learned counsel for the plaintiff as to how that should be arrived at, there are difficulties in that it is not clear as to the number of hours per week to be worked or that the plaintiff would have worked in an orthopaedic ward.  Whether the psychiatric or psychological difficulties in relation to the orthopaedic ward would have prevented her from being the nurse in charge, were matters not explored in the plaintiff's case and their absence make it difficult to assess the plaintiff's past economic loss.
Whilst it is clear in my view as expressed, the plaintiff cannot carry out the work in the orthopaedic ward, or should not, she is still earning whilst working in the neo-natal ward, similar monies when working the twenty four to thirty hour shift.
I accept that there is a difference between $1,089 net per week which the plaintiff would have earned in the orthopaedic ward and the $571 net per week which she actually earned as revealed in her 2007 tax return for the period of twenty two weeks.  The difficulty with this is it is not as clear cut as that for the reasons I have indicated above.  The plaintiff makes a claim for $11,396 and i think it is appropriate only to allow compensation in the sum of $10,000 for the wage loss, bearing in mind the plaintiff at the time had not returned to beyond twenty hours per week, although it was her intention to do so as soon as she could thereafter.
There are then claims of a loss in charge of the orthopaedic ward for three years at $400 per week loss of long service leave for the period she was off work.  The difference between the $1,089 net per week and the $867 net per week that she actually earned in 2009, a difference between $1,089 net per week plus ten percent which it is alleged is the increase in earnings for 2010.
The matters which I have referred are all contributory to the difficulties in determining an appropriate figure to properly compensate the plaintiff for this past loss.
In relation to the long service leave I am of the view - five months - and there is no evidence that comes from the hospital as to this loss, I propose to allow a figure in the sum of $2,000.
In relation to the other three, the loss of being in charge, and the difference between the figures that have been referred to, the totality of those figures come to approximately $100,000.  I do not think that it is appropriate to award a figure anywhere near that because of the difficulties to which I have referred, and I allow the sum of $30,000 for that past general economic loss."" (RAB 51A-53L)
30As the above quotation makes clear, there is considerable force in the submission that the reasons provided by his Honour for his assessment were not adequate.  In fairness to his Honour, however, while his reasons may be sparse to the point of error, the evidence which he had before him upon which he was asked to base his conclusions was exiguous in the extreme.  The other difficulty is that his Honour misunderstood the evidence.  Accordingly, it is necessary to reassess the appellant's claim for past economic loss in accordance with the evidence.  This is a task which the Court can carry out for itself since his Honour has already made all of the necessary demeanour and credit findings in relation to the appellant's evidence.  
31It was not correct for his Honour to say that there was ""no real evidence to indicate that the work in the orthopaedic ward would not produce shifts of the same duration"".  There was such evidence (Black 35J-N).  What the appellant said was that in the orthopaedic ward she was able to work thirty hour shifts but in the neonatal ward the shifts varied between 24 and 30 hours, depending upon her roster.  At the very least this would indicate a loss to the appellant of 3 hours per week when working in the neonatal ward by comparison with the orthopaedic ward.
32The appellant's claim for economic loss, both past and future, was based upon taxation returns for the years ended 30 June 2007, 30 June 2008, 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2010, together with a single ""Summary of Earnings"" document which covered the period 12 November 2007 - 25 November 2007, being just before she was injured (Blue 261).  At that time the appellant was working 20 hours per week in the orthopaedic ward and the net pay recorded was $1,453.36 for those two weeks.  Using those figures, the appellant extrapolated what she would have earned for 30 hours per week at $1,089 net.  That calculation appears to have been accepted by the parties at trial as accurate.
33There was no issue that following this fall, the appellant was off work for 22 weeks and that during this time she could not perform any work.  By reference to the ""Summary of Earnings"" document, her loss during this period would have been $726.68 net per week until January 2008 when on his Honour's findings, she would have increased her hours of work to 30 so that thereafter her net loss per week would have been $1,089.  There was no basis in the evidence to justify why his Honour did not award to the appellant her full wage loss for that period, i.e. $22,508.72.
34His Honour appears to have misunderstood the nature of the monies which the appellant was receiving while she was off work.  She was receiving $571 net per week by way of long service leave.  She had no sick leave left and because the injury occurred in non-employment circumstances, she was not entitled to workers compensation.  His Honour should not have taken that $571 net per week into account since that was not money paid to the appellant as a result of the accident, but because of her employment entitlements generally (Zheng v Cai [2009] HCA 52, 239 CLR 446; National Insurance Co of New Zealand Ltd v Espagne (1961) 105 CLR 569 at 598-600; Redding v Lee (1983) 151 CLR 117 at 137).  Accordingly, that aspect of his Honour's award of damages for past economic loss needs to be corrected.
35His Honour's difficulty in assessing the balance of the appellant's claim for past economic loss, i.e. 26 May 2008  until the date of judgment, arose largely from the way in which submissions were made to him and from the paucity of evidence.  This Court was provided with a copy of the calculations for past economic loss which were placed before his Honour (mfi (1)).  It is clear from those calculations that the appellant's submissions at trial misunderstood the contents of the ""Summary of Earnings"" document.  It is, of course, entirely unexplained why only one ""Summary of Earnings"" document was placed before the court covering a period of 2 weeks when there must have been such documents available for the whole of the period.
36In submissions at trial, a claim was made on behalf of the appellant for $62,400 on the basis that while she was working in the orthopaedic ward she received an extra allowance for being ""in charge"" which she did not receive in the neonatal ward.  It was submitted that the value of this extra payment was $400 per week.  When, however, one looks at the ""Summary of Earnings"" it can be seen that the extra amount for being ""in charge"" was $25 per week.  His Honour was obviously uneasy about the accuracy of the figures put to him and that is why he awarded a $30,000 buffer for that part of the claim for past economic loss.
37The tax returns which were in evidence show the appellant's weekly wage for the year ending 30 June 2009 to be $869 net and $925 net for the year ending 30 June 2010.  On the basis that the extrapolated figure of $1,089 net per week correctly reflected what the appellant would have been earning working 30 hours per week in the orthopaedic ward, there is a difference of $220 net per week for the 2009 tax year and $164 net per week for the 2010 tax year.  The average net loss for the appellant over the period would therefore be $192 net per week.  This is reasonably close to the appellant's own estimate of her net loss per week of $150 (Black 35E).
38If one calculates the weekly loss for the appellant at $192 net per week from 28 May 2008 until 10 February 2011 when judgment was handed down, the figure reached is $27,072.  Accordingly, his Honour's buffer of $30,000 was a reasonable approximation of the appellant's actual loss and there being no cross-appeal, it should not be interfered with.
39It follows from the above analysis that his Honour's award of damages for past economic loss of $42,000 should be set aside and replaced with a figure of $52,508.72.  There will need to be a commensurate adjustment to the past superannuation loss figure.
Future economic loss/loss of earning capacity
40His Honour dealt with this part of the appellant's claim as follows:
""As to the future economic loss the plaintiff is in a situation where obviously she cannot return to the orthopaedic ward.  She is capable of working the 24 and 30 hours per week which she does in the neonatal ward, differential only for the extra hours worked in the orthopaedic ward and when being in charge.  It is impossible to give an accurate weekly loss for this figure.
In addition to that there is to be taken into account the psychological difficulties the plaintiff has had, her health problems in relation to back on prior occasions, the shoulder which may or may not be related to this accident, I make no finding in that respect, and the question that may add to the damages is the question of the possibility of surgery, although this would only be a deferral, and it is probably unlikely to have occurred within the next five years.  I am of the view the appropriate figure to allow is that of $30,000 for future economic loss.""  (RAB 53.M-53Y)
41The appellant submitted that the figure of $1,089 net per week which was agreed as being the likely net weekly earnings of the appellant in the orthopaedic ward as of January 2008 should be increased by 10 percent to represent what the appellant would have been earning in the orthopaedic ward as of the date of judgment.  On that basis, she submitted that there was an actual loss of approximately $270 net per week which could and should have been used by his Honour to calculate future economic loss, rather than the modest buffer which his Honour chose.
42The appellant submitted that his Honour should not have taken into account her pre-existing psychological difficulties and pre-existing back problems as discounting her claim for future economic loss because these matters had not prevented her in the past from working in the orthopaedic ward.  The appellant submitted that there was no evidentiary basis for his Honour taking those matters into account as a discounting factor for the future.
43The appellant submitted that his Honour did not properly take into account the possibility that she might have to undergo surgery before she turned 65.  If that occurred, not only would she lose time off work but the nature of the operation was such that she might well be forced into a premature retirement from nursing at that point in time (Dr Deveridge Blue 135N).
44His Honour was justified in saying that it was ""impossible to give an adequate weekly loss"" for future economic loss.  It is surprising and unexplained why evidence was not placed before his Honour as to the earnings of a registered nurse working 30 hours per week in the orthopaedic ward.  Even a current ""Summary of Earnings"" document in respect of the appellant would have been useful.  On the other hand, there was no basis for his Honour taking into account the appellant's pre-existing psychological problems and back problems as a discounting factor for the future (which was a relatively short period) when there was no evidence that they had adversely affected her employment in the past.
45The figures relied upon by the appellant to indicate an actual wage loss of approximately $270 net per week at the time of judgment are unreliable in the absence of any more recent wage documents than the ""Summary of Earnings"" for two weeks in November 2007.  It is reasonable to accept that there would be some increase in the earnings of the appellant, had she continued to work in the orthopaedic ward, between what she was paid in November 2007 and what she would have been paid in February 2011.  The extent of that increase is, however, not known.  There is also the added complication that the ""in charge"" allowance of $25 per week would no longer be applicable since at the time of trial, the appellant had just started receiving that allowance in the neonatal ward.  The figures suggested by the appellant give a false precision to what can only be a broad estimate given the paucity of evidence.
46Nevertheless, the appellant's tax return for the 2010 tax year, by reference to what the appellant would have been earning in January 2008, shows a clear weekly loss.  Even allowing for the ""in charge"" allowance now being paid for her work in the neonatal ward, it seems that as of February 2011 the appellant was suffering a weekly loss in the order of $200 net per week.  This is a very approximate figure but it can be used to check the reasonableness of the buffer awarded to the appellant by his Honour.  
47Using the 5 percent tables and deducting 10 percent for vicissitudes, given the short period involved, a net loss of $200 per week until the appellant turns 65 would produce a loss of $36,000.  That figure, of course, makes no allowance for the chance that the appellant might have to undergo an operation which would not only cause her to lose time from work, but to use the words of Dr Deveridge ""might well force her into a premature retirement"".
48Taking all those matters into account, I conclude that the buffer awarded by his Honour does not adequately reflect the appellant's future loss of earning capacity.  I would allow a buffer of $40,000.  That would result in a commensurate adjustment to the future loss of superannuation figure.
Future domestic assistance
49His Honour dealt with this aspect of the claim as follows:
""As to other domestic assistance, the plaintiff in the past has been able to rely on the assistance of friends and family.  She has never sought to employ carers in and around the home, and I think it is unlikely that she will do so unless there are some circumstances that her friends or daughter are unable to provide assistance.  I think the plaintiff is stoic.  I think she is a person who would do her best to survive, no matter surgery or the sequelae of it, with the assistance of her daughter and friends.  This then means taking into account the recent Court of Appeal decision in Hill v Forester, the plaintiff having established the first entitlement of six months gratuitous care is entitled to care for six hours per week.
It is impossible to predict, although in my view it will occur, because of the worsening condition with her arm, and she will on many occasions require the provision of six hours per week domestic care.  It is impossible to quantify this sum, however, I am of the view that a proper figure to allow for it as to the future would be in the sum of $10,000 which may lack generosity to the plaintiff, but in doing the best I can between the parties.""  (RAB 55Q-56F)
50The appellant submitted that his Honour's assessment did not have due regard to the evidence of Ms Zieba that as of the date of trial, she was still providing four hours per week of assistance in performing housework.  The appellant submitted that his Honour's assessment ignored the evidence of the appellant that if money were available, she would pay for assistance in performing her housework, rather than have a friend or her daughter do it (Black 37P).  At trial the appellant claimed $200 per week, being 5 hours at $40 per hour of paid assistance for 27 years.  Before this Court the appellant's claim was 4 hours per week at $40 per hour for 10 years on the basis that a proper allowance had to be made for the appellant's other disabilities.
51In the alternative, the appellant submitted that his Honour's assessment of her need for domestic assistance was based on her current condition.  It did not make proper allowance for the effects of the operation which the doctors agreed would occur within the next 5 to 10 years and which would further reduce her capacity to perform housework in that her left wrist would be fused.  The appellant submitted that his Honour's assessment also failed to have adequate regard to the likely worsening of the arthritis in the wrist and the length of time over which the assistance would be required, i.e. 27 years.
52The evidence of Ms Zieba as to still providing some domestic assistance for the appellant cannot be reconciled with the appellant's own evidence.  The appellant's evidence was that she received assistance from Ms Zieba and her daughter for about 6 months following the injury, but thereafter she did her own housework (Black 38J).  That evidence is consistent with what is recorded by Dr Deveridge in January 2009:
""She has recovered to the extent that she can do her own housework although she does not have a great deal and it is spread out over the week.""  (Blue 134G)
53The appellant is in the best position to know what her needs are.  It was open to his Honour to conclude that the appellant was able to perform her normal household tasks without assistance, albeit more slowly than before.
54His Honour was entitled to reject the evidence as to paid assistance for the reasons which he set out.  Other than lawn mowing, the appellant had never sought to employ anyone in the past.  His conclusion as to her stoicism was a demeanour based finding which ought not be interfered with.  His Honour had the opportunity of observing the appellant give evidence over two days.  His conclusion as to her stoicism is also consistent with her evidence that she did the housework herself and what she told Dr Deveridge in January 2009.  Accordingly, his Honour was entitled to reject the submission that allowance should be made for paid housework assistance in the future.
55The alternative submission made by the appellant has more force.  Twenty seven years is a long time.  It seems clear that the appellant will come to an operation within 5 to 10 years and that the fusion of her left wrist will render her more disabled than she is at the present time.  Even allowing for the effect of her other unrelated health issues and her present ability to perform housework, $10,000 is insufficient to meet her likely future needs flowing from this fall.  Over the next 27 years there is a real chance that her friend and her daughter will be unable to assist her so that paid assistance will be necessary.  In my opinion, an appropriate allowance for future domestic assistance is $25,000.
Future out-of-pocket expenses
56The appellant submitted that his Honour appeared to have forgotten to make any allowance for the cost of an operation which all the doctors opined that she would need.  The respondents accepted that this was so.  They submitted that the operation should be deferred for 5 years in accordance with Dr Deveridge's estimate and that allowance also had to be made for the 2 years which had elapsed between the date of Dr Deveridge's report and the date of judgment.  This would produce an allowance for the operation of $12,527.  The approach by the respondents was not challenged by the appellant and I accept it as reasonable.
57The appellant also referred to the evidence of Dr Deveridge as to other future treatment expenses:
""Future treatment is likely to involve intermittent analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medication indefinitely.  She will need to see her general practitioner every month or two for repeat prescriptions.  She could reasonably attend sporadic sessions of physiotherapy ($65 per session) at times of future relapse.   She is going to develop slowly advancing secondary osteoarthritis in the left wrist joint in future years.""  (Blue 135K)
58The appellant submitted that some allowance should be made for this likely future expenditure.
59This is a very difficult claim to quantify.  The taking of analgesia and anti-inflammatory medication is only going to occur on an ""intermittent"" basis.  The need to attend her general practitioner on a regular basis would also be caused by her other disabilities, which were unrelated to this fall.  There is no evidence of her having undergone any physiotherapy in the past.  Nevertheless, difficulties of calculation should not prevent the Court making an award of damages if the appellant is otherwise entitled to them.  The need for such future treatment is consistent with the opinions of the other doctors.  I propose to allow a figure of $5,000 which is the equivalent of $6 per week over the next 27 years.
Conclusion
60It follows from the above analysis that I would allow the appellant's appeal and would award damages in favour of the appellant as follows:
Non-economic loss 26 percent$   40,000.00Past out-of-pocket expenses$   17,832.00Past economic loss $   52,508.72Superannuation on past economic loss$     5,776.00Future economic loss$   40,000.00Superannuation on future economic loss$      4,400.00Past domestic assistance$   13,455.00Past lawn mowing$     2,500.00Future domestic assistance (lawn mowing)$   10,000.00General future domestic assistance$   25,000.00Future out-of-pocket expenses$   17,527.00Total$ 228,998.72

61Since the damages now to be awarded in favour of the appellant exceed the Offer of Compromise made by the respondents before trial, the award at trial of indemnity costs in favour of the respondents also needs to be set aside.
62The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) Appeal allowed.
(2) The judgment of the primary judge in favour of the appellant in the amount of $173,707 is set aside.
(3) In lieu thereof judgment is entered in favour of the appellant in the amount of $228,998.72.
(4) The costs orders made by the primary judge on 10 February 2011 are set aside.
(5) In lieu thereof the respondents are to pay the appellant's costs of the trial.
(6) The respondents are to pay the appellant's costs of this appeal.

		15 June 2012",2012-06-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2708073,R v SBR [2012] NSWCCA 233,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  The respondent pleaded guilty to three counts concerning child pornography. Counts 1 and 2 alleged that the respondent had produced child pornography contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Count 3 alleged that the respondent had possessed child pornography contrary to the same section. He pleaded guilty shortly before the trial and was afforded a discount of 12½ percent by the sentencing judge. At the time that he was sentenced he asked the judge to take into account a single count of aggravated sexual assault under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act on a Form 1.
2The maximum penalty for each offence was ten years imprisonment. The offence contrary to s 61M(1) of the Act has a standard non-parole period of seven years. 
3Although the respondent pleaded guilty on 19 October 2010, the matter was not dealt with immediately. It was initially stood over for sentence to 25 February 2011 when submissions were received, however, defence counsel made an application that further reports be obtained and the matter was adjourned for a further six months. The respondent was ultimately sentenced on 15 December 2011, more than twelve months after his original plea.
4The sentences imposed were as follows:
Counts 1 and 2:A fixed term of 12months imprisonment, both sentences to date from 9 December 2011.The form 1 offence was taken into account on count 1.
Count 3:A fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to date from 9 June 2012.
This sentence was made concurrent with the last six months of the sentences in relation to counts 1 and 2.
5Accordingly the total effective sentence was one of 18 months imprisonment. The sentencing judge suspended the entirety of the sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Short particulars of each of the counts are as follows:
Count 1: produce child pornography:These photographs were taken on 20 November 2008 at the young person's grandfather's house at Bushby. The 14 images were taken in the early afternoon when the young person was asleep on a lounge chair wearing a red T-shirt. They were taken on the day of a family lunch when the young persons' father was out of the house speaking with neighbours. The 14 photographs show a view inside the young person's T-shirt which was being pulled out, or perhaps up, to expose one or both of her breasts. The images were largely focused on her breasts.
The Form 1 matter:  This photograph was taken on 2 November 2008 and appears within the same series of photographs the subject of count 1. In this photograph the respondent is depicted kneeling, with his lips in contact with the young person's side just above her hip.
Count 2:  produce child pornography:This count concerns 35 images taken in the early hours of 14 February 2009 at the respondent's residence. The respondent had taken the young person to Luna Park on 13 February. The 35 images show the young person asleep in the respondent's bed with her pyjama top above her breasts, leaving both breasts exposed. In some photographs the young person's hand partially covers her breasts.
Count 3:  possess child pornography:  When police searched the respondent's premises they located a CD inside the drive of one of his computers. It was marked ""Steven's Kodak Pics 2"" and it contained 235 images of female children. The images appeared to be professionally taken and it is probable that they were downloaded from a child pornography web site. Some 7 of them were classified at level 9 on the COPINE scale, another 20 were at level 7, the others were lower down the scale.
6The respondent was sentenced in accordance with the facts that had been agreed.
7As it happened, on 8 March 2009 the respondent was arrested by police for an unrelated matter. At the time of the arrest the police seized a camera in his possession, and later applied for, and were granted, a warrant to search his premises. During that search two computers were seized and they were subsequently examined, and that examination revealed the factual matter relevant to count 3. During the examination the disk that I have referred to was identified.
8During the course of examining the photographic material the police identified a number of images of the young person, who is the second cousin of the respondent and was aged 12 at the time. I should confirm that there is a non-publication order that is made in relation to the young person's identity. The young person was depicted, firstly, lying on a lounge and appeared to be sleeping. Two of the images were not child pornography but were images of her face. There are, however, 14 photographs showing a view inside the young person's T-shirt when it was pulled up, and there is one image, as I have already related, which depicts the respondent kneeling, with his lips in contact with the young person's side just above the hip.
9In relation to count 2, again the police located the images on the camera. She is depicted wearing pink pyjamas. There are 35 images of her asleep under the sheets with the pyjama top above her breasts, which were exposed and, accordingly, could be photographed.
10The respondent was arrested and at the time of his arrest made a number of admissions in relation to the offences. He participated in an ERISP, and freely admitted the possession of the disk and to knowledge of its content.
11Police enquiries with the young person and her father revealed that the respondent had over the years had significant contact with the young person and had engaged in conventional and innocent behaviour with her during those occasions.
12In relation to count 2, the respondent said that the young person had slept as his premises on that evening after attending Luna Park. She had slept in his bed while he slept on the recliner lounge. He admitted taking the photographs of the young person during the evening.
13The sentencing judge in his careful and detailed remarks on sentence assessed the objective seriousness of each of the offences. His Honour had particular regard to the decision of this Court in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; (2010) 201 A Crim R 243 in which matters relevant to the seriousness of this type of offending were discussed. His Honour concluded that there was little to distinguish between counts 1 and 2 even taking into account the matter on the Form 1. His Honour accepted that the assault was a very low level example of an indecent assault. His Honour ultimately concluded that both counts 1 and 2 and the matter on the Form 1 fell towards the lower end of the scale for matters of their kind. His Honour also concluded that count 3 was towards the lower end of the scale, and but for the fact that there were a number of photos depicting very young children and a small number at the very high end of the COPINE scale, his Honour concluded that this count would also have fallen at the bottom of the range of seriousness.
14The respondent was aged 51 at the time he was sentenced. He first attended a session with forensic psychiatrist Rima Nasr on 7 October 2010, less than 2 weeks before entering his pleas of guilty. Ms Nasr observed an odd demeanour, disjointed thought processes, limited insight, narcissistic personality traits, and a grandiose and egocentric self-image. He had been referred to her by the respondent's legal advisors.
15Ms Nasr assessed the respondent as of low average verbal intellectual function and average non-verbal intellectual function, but overall in an average range. Ms Nasr referred the respondent to a neuro-psychologist, Dr Wayne Reid.
16Dr Reid concluded that the respondent ""presented as mildly fatuous, with concrete and somewhat grandiose ideation of time ... did not always appear to grasp the wider meaning of questions ... he was a vague and inconsistent historian ... On testing no impairments were seen in (the respondent's) naming, verbal generativity and simple perceptuo-clerical speed. The underlying reason for the above deficits is unclear. ... The early stages of fronto-temporal dementia is a possibility.""
17Dr Reid found the respondent's presentation to be unusual and concluded that there was a possibility that he was developing Alzheimers disease.
18Ms Nasr indicated that although the respondent was initially ambivalent to engaging in any treatment, he had subsequently become motivated and had made a commitment to ongoing psychological treatment and assistance. 
19The sentencing judge had paid careful regard to these reports. In particular he emphasised that a reading of Ms Nasr's reports indicated that the respondent required extensive therapeutic intervention and that further treatment was required. Ms Nasr had concluded that if the treatment continues there was ""at least a reasonable chance of (the respondent) not reoffending in the future.""
20Ultimately his Honour concluded that a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate but determined that it should be suspended, having regard to his Honour's conclusion that ""it is vital for the (the respondent) and for the community that he continue with his rehabilitation, and keeping in mind the objective seriousness of the offences, and the fact that it now over 2½ years ago that these offences were committed.""
21The Crown ultimately filed five grounds of appeal. They are as follows:
Ground 1: By failing to accumulate the sentence for count 2 his Honour did not acknowledge that count 2 was a separate act of criminality to count 1.
Ground 2: His Honour failed to properly determine the objective seriousness of count 3.
Ground 3: In suspending the sentence his Honour failed to have adequate regard to general deterrence.
Ground 4: His Honour found contrition and remorse where none was demonstrated; and
Ground 5: His Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried and resulted in the imposition of a sentence which is manifestly inadequate.
22In the written submissions filed in support of the appeal the Crown advanced arguments in relation to each of the grounds but ultimately acknowledge that discretionary factors loomed large in the appeal and accepted that the sentencing judge's remarks demonstrate an acknowledgment of the relevant principles and the factors to which he was obliged to have regard. It was, however, submitted that the sentencing judge had placed undue weight on the respondent's efforts at rehabilitation and had too readily dismissed proper consideration of the need to convey the very serious way in which courts view the possession of child pornography, the exploitation and abuse inherent in its making and the substantial breach of trust brought about by its creation. In the course of oral submissions made to this Court today, counsel for the Crown in his measured and appropriate submissions, emphasised the possible problems with the way in which his Honour dealt with the matter of contrition and remorse. I will return to that issue in due course.
23The grounds of appeal involve two matters of particular significance. Ground 1 submits that his Honour should have provided a separate period of identifiable imprisonment for each of counts 1 and 2 rather than make them concurrent. Ground 2 asserts that his Honour failed to properly determine the objective seriousness of count 3.
24With respect to ground1 I accept that each of counts 1 and 2 were distinct acts of criminality. However, their character was similar and his Honour was correct to conclude that they were at the lowest end of any scale of objective criminality. This Court has emphasised in the past that there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively which is a matter for the sentencing judge. The critical issue is whether the total sentence is appropriate having regard to all of the offending: R v Cahyodi (2007) NSWCCA 1 at [12] and [27]. I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in adopting the approach which he did. 
25With respect to count 3 in my opinion it is a more serious offence than either counts 1 or 2. The offence involved the accumulation of 235 photographs which were presumably downloaded from the internet, some of which were at a high level on the COPINE scale. They are of course the product of the exploitation and abuse of young persons by others. This Court has commenced upon the seriousness of this crime on other occasions. If I had been sentencing at first instance I would probably have concluded that a sentence greater than 12 months was appropriate for this offence.
26Apart from the matter of contrition and remorse, with respect to the other grounds of appeal I am satisfied that the findings which his Honour made were open. Having regard to the identified disabilities of the respondent and the prospect that counselling, which would occur outside of the prison system, was essential to the rehabilitation of the respondent, I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in failing to have appropriate regard to general deterrence. 
27It is correct, as the appellant emphasises, that the respondent did not demonstrate his contrition and remorse in a forthright manner. Indeed, complaint is made that his Honour's finding in this respect was erroneous, having regard to the failure of the respondent to expressly acknowledge and express contrition for his offending. When considering this issue his Honour had regard to the reports of Ms Nasr and Dr Reid. It is true that nowhere in the reports does the respondent directly acknowledge his wrongdoing or the breach of trust involved in his actions. Furthermore, it is apparent that at least in his initial consultation there were difficulties in effectively discussing the issues with the respondent. However, those difficulties have since passed and it is plain that the respondent is now undertaking a treatment program. His Honour was mindful of the reports from these persons, but acknowledged that without the respondent giving evidence it was difficult to discern whether or not he was genuinely remorseful. However, his Honour accepted the plea of guilty and his commitment to an extensive program of treatment supported the conclusion which his Honour made that the respondent was, by the time that he was sentenced, remorseful for his actions.
28Although the evidentiary foundation for his Honour's conclusion may not be strong, I am not persuaded that, having regard to the matters which his Honour considered, the finding which he made was not open.
29The principles relevant to a Crown appeal are well known. They were discussed at length by this Court in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 and by the High Court in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 86 ALJR 36. As the Crown submissions effectively concede, his Honour's remarks on sentence do not reveal any errors of principle, but rather the appellant asserts that his Honour's discretionary judgments were erroneous, particularly in relation to the sentence imposed with respect to count 3. 
30I have indicated my acceptance that the sentence for count 3 may have reasonably been greater, however, his Honour was entitled in all of the circumstances to emphasise the fact that by the time he was sentenced the respondent had embarked upon a process of rehabilitation involving psychological counselling which would have been disrupted, if not completely lost, if he was now incarcerated. 
31In so far as those matters legitimately loom large at the time that the respondent was sentenced, they are of even greater significance to this Court. This Court has been provided with evidence which confirms that the respondent has continued his counselling and has maintained a stable residential address. 
32Even if I was persuaded that the sentencing judge had erred in a manner which may require the intervention of this Court in respect of the sentence for any particular offence, I would, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case, in the exercise of the court's discretion, declined to intervene.
33Accordingly, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.
34PRICE J:  I agree with the Chief Judge.
35BUTTON J:  I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law.
36McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  Accordingly, the order of the court is as I have indicated.

		12 November 2012",2012-06-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708075,R v Cornwall [2012] NSWDC 183,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: I trust that Mr Cornwell will not mind if I describe him as an unusual offender. I will explain why in a little while but the nature of his personality and the nature of his offending are quite unusual.

2He appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to three offences. Two are offences of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely to steal and the third is an unaggravated form of that offence. The circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown is that the offender was in company.

3The aggravated offences have maximum penalties of 20 years imprisonment and standard non parole periods of five years. The unaggravated form of the offence has a maximum penalty of 14 years.

4I have taken into account of course the maximum penalties and the standard non parole periods where appropriate in formulating the appropriate sentences to impose upon Mr Cornwell. My reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

5When Mr Cornwell was about 18 and three-quarters, he commenced a series of offences in which he targeted schools and, in particular, computer and other electronic equipment within those schools. At around midnight on 20 January 2011 he and a co-offender, who was under 18 at the time and so I will not name him, attended the Weston Primary School. They jumped over the security fence and went to the fairly recently constructed IT room. That was an important aspect of the school. It was built following Federal Government grants and was intended to be an important development for both students and staff. It was hoped also that it would benefit the wider community. The school is in an area of substantial disadvantage where there are families who have been unemployed for generations. The principal of the school, Mr Withers, gave evidence today about how important this new IT room and the equipment within it was.

6The offender and his co-offender took the rubber seal from a window, removed a sheet of glass and went into the classroom. They removed a large, flat screen television and parts of some computers which they then took to Mr Cornwell's home. They left unlocked one of the windows. It was through that means that the offender went back to the same school on 24 January, went through the unlocked window and took two hard drives from computers. 

7A few days later on 28 January the offender and his co-offender targeted a different school, Kurri Kurri Public School. He was an ex student of both schools. They took with them this time another relatively young person who was over the age of 18 and thus who I can name, Amy Foster. She was to drive the getaway vehicle. 

8The offender and his young co-offender broke into the school and began looking for items of value. They found some Coca Cola and had a drink, took some green environmental bags and got some keys, intending to use them to gain access to various rooms throughout the school. Before they could take much else, however, they were detected. They were eventually arrested by police who had been called by security, who noticed what was going on.

9The offender, Mr Cornwell, made admissions about what he had just done and, when police later searched his home and found property relating to the Weston Public School offences, he made admissions to those offences as well and directed police to where the stolen property was hidden. 

10Although Mr Booth did not rely on the principle of parity, I will note that the young offender received 100 hours community service and so did Ms Foster. Given Ms Foster's involvement in a single offence, Mr Booth was right not to rely on the principle of parity. Similar comments can be made about the sentencing of the juvenile offender.

11The offender appeared in court today. Neither of his parents was able to be here. His father is unwell and his mother had commitments with children. His parents separated when the offender was quite young. He remained with his father but has spent times living with his mother and sister. He left school in year 11 and although he has done some work and is currently doing voluntary work he spent some time on unemployment benefits. At the time of these offences he says that he had no money. The offender's offending was quite targeted for reasons he explained in evidence. He needed, for example, two hard drives. He did not just take everything that he could find but took only what he needed. His offending was quite focused in that way. He wanted some computer equipment and he was prepared to commit serious offences to get it.

12The offender is now working in an op shop on a voluntary basis. That only recently started but the offender enjoys it. 

13I mentioned before and again I trust Mr Cornwell will forgive me for saying this, that Mr Cornwell acts somewhat unusually. He was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome in 2003, although he describes symptoms of that syndrome from a much earlier age. Other possible diagnoses have been given, Asperger's Syndrome has been mentioned or high functioning autism without cognitive impairment. I have watched him in the witness box as he gave evidence. He is now 20 years of age and his behaviour was such that I have got no doubt that he would be quite vulnerable in prison. Prisons are terrible places. Any sign of weakness is seen as an opportunity by bored and usually violent prisoners for those prisoners to entertain themselves. I have got no doubt that the offender's time in custody would be considerably harder than that served by most other prisoners.

14He has in fact spent some time in custody, not in relation to these offences but in relation to other offences which he committed whilst on bail for these offences. The facts of those offences were put before, me appropriately, as an indication as to the offender's prospects for rehabilitation. They do suggest that, despite reaching the age of almost 19 without committing any further offences, Mr Cornwell was starting on a career which involved regular offending but he did spend 53 days in custody, bail refused, on these subsequent matters. He does not get any credit for pre-sentence custody from me, because no doubt that period was taken into account by the magistrate who dealt with the subsequent offences, in reaching the decision not to impose a sentence of full time custody upon him for very serious offences. 

15But what is much more relevant is the experience that Mr Cornwell had whilst in custody. It seems that the victim of his subsequent offences was a prison offender. For that reason, and I have got no doubt also because of his behaviour and age, he spent his time in custody on protection. Despite that, he was subject to threats and spent his 53 days in custody in a very unpleasant manner. Because he was on protection, it was assumed by other prisoners that he was a paedophile. He of course is not serving any sentence for anything relating to paedophilia or child sexual assault, but such subtleties were not appreciated by other prisoners.

16I am not the first person to note that prisoners have an unusual sense of morality but one thing is clear, prisoners regard paedophiles as the lowest of the low and are prepared to inflict violence upon them simply for what they are. I repeat, the offender is not in that category but he was assumed to be by other prisoners. The experience of having spent those 53 days in custody has been a salutary lesson for the offender. I have also got no doubt that, were he to return to full time custody, he would most likely serve any sentence on protection and most likely the things that he experienced while he was bail refused would recur.

17The offender expressed his remorse. It is quite beneficial that Mr Withers, the Principal of Weston Public School, was able to tell me and also the offender of the harm that his offending caused. I am sure that at the time the offender committed these offences he had not thought about the consequences for the school, that is the staff, the students and even the wider community, about what he was doing. That harm was substantial, although not everything was taken. The room could not be used for a number of months and it was six or seven months until the IT room was back up and running as it had been before. 

18The offender described his behaviour as abhorrent. I accept that he is remorseful. Often when offenders are asked by their counsel whether they intend to commit any offences in the future, they confidently say that they will not. Mr Cornwell did not. He has a realistic attitude to what he was thinking about when he committed these offences and the chances of him ever feeling that way in the future. He hopes that he will not commit further offences but - and this is a demonstration of how honest he seemed to be in the witness box - he did not say that he could guarantee that he would not.

19The actual ultimate sentence to be imposed upon Mr Cornwell is quite difficult to work out. It is clear, given the objective gravity of what he did, that a sentence of imprisonment is required. It is clear that I am not able to determine the length of the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed with a view to how I would like those sentences to be served and it is clear that the objective gravity of what the offender did was high indeed. But it is equally clear that the experience of having spent some time in custody has had a significant impact on the offender and thus his prospects for rehabilitation. It is also equally clear, as I have attempted to demonstrate perhaps ad nauseam, Mr Cornwell's time in custody would be very difficult indeed.

20Mr Booth, assuming of course that the sentences would be two years or less, began by suggesting that suspended sentences of imprisonment would be appropriate. Even assuming that I will get to two years or less, I do not consider that a suspended sentence is appropriate. The offender needs to be personally deterred from further offending. He should not at all get the idea that, because of the factors that I have described regarding him, he can commit further offences without being effectively punished. A suspended sentence of imprisonment is, in the circumstances of this case, insufficient punishment.

21As a fallback position, Mr Booth asked me to consider the imposition of an intensive corrections order. The Crown did not speak in opposition to that outcome. Ordinarily these three separate offences would require significant periods of imprisonment and significant levels of partial accumulation. Given the outcome I have in mind it is not necessary for me at this stage to indicate the precise manner in which sentences will be calculated but I have reached the conclusion that the offender would be sentenced to imprisonment for two years or less and I have also reached the conclusion that it is appropriate that he be referred for assessment as to his suitability to serve his sentence by means of an intensive corrections order. I therefore continue the offender's bail.

22The offender is referred for assessment as to his suitability to serve that sentence by way of an ICO. I will order a transcript of those remarks I have just delivered. I do not think it is necessary to order a transcript of the evidence.

23I will dismiss the matter on the 166 certificate at the request of the Crown.

24Mr Cornwell just let me speak to you. You haven't been sentenced to go back to gaol yet. You are not out of the woods though. If the Corrective Services say you are not suitable for one of these intensive corrections orders I have got little alternative so you want to make sure you do everything that they require so that you get a favourable report. I will speak to you about this later anyway if you do get a favourable report. It is not an easy sentence. It is not like a suspended sentence where you have just got to be of good behaviour. You will be on a curfew, you will be subject to regular attendance by Probation and Parole. You have to do voluntary work. There are so many things that you will have to do so it is not an easy option by any means and I will remind you of this if you are suitable on 24 August. But I don't want you to think that you have escaped gaol yet. A lot depends on what happens on 24 August and even if you are suitable on that occasion a lot will depend on how you go during the period of the Intensive Corrections Order. If you don't do well you'll be back in gaol understand.

25OFFENDER: Yes.

2708084,Lee v R [2012] NSWCCA 123,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA: Offence and sentenceOn 9 July 2010 the applicant was arraigned before Latham J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on an indictment charging the following counts:
Count 1 - Conspiracy to deal with money, being to the value of $1 million or more, intending it would become an instrument of crime contrary to sections 11.5(1) and 403(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  The maximum penalty for count 1 was imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $165,000.
Count 2 - Conspiracy to import prohibited imports, being not less than a trafficable quantity of heroin, contrary to s233B(1)(a)(iii) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s11.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  The maximum penalty for count 2 was imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine $550,000.
Count 3 - Conspiracy to traffic in a marketable quantity of controlled drugs, heroin and methamphetamine, contrary to s11.5(1) and 302.3(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  The maximum penalty for count 3 was imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $550,000.
2Thereafter the applicant was tried upon the indicted offences before Latham J and a jury.  On 29 July 2010, towards the end of the Crown case, on the eleventh day of the trial, the applicant was re-arraigned and changed his pleas to guilty.  Sentence proceedings were then conducted before Latham J on 16 August, 8 October, 12 November, 17 November, 2 December and 14 December 2010.
3On 25 February 2011 her Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:
(i) In respect of count 1 imprisonment for a term of 5 years and 6 months to date from 12 June 2010, expiring on 11 December 2015.
(ii) In respect of count 2 imprisonment for a term of 7 years to date from 12 June 2010 and expiring 11 June 2017.
(iii) In respect of count 3 imprisonment for a term of 6 years to date from 12 June 2016 expiring 11 June 2022.
The sentences provide for a non-parole period of 8 years to date from 12 June 2010, the applicant being eligible for release on 12 June 2018.  The aggregate sentence was therefore imprisonment for a term of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.
4By Notice of Appeal filed 18 November 2011 the applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentences imposed for each of the three counts.  The grounds of appeal are:Count 1Ground of Appeal 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate effect to the finding that the applicant played a lesser role in the commission of the dealing with the money to the value of $1 million or more which they intended would become an instrument of crime such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 2 - The applicant has a legitimate grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentence imposed upon his co-offenders, Khanh Hoang Tran, Hong Phong Le and Ngoc Thuan Nguyen such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 3 - The learned trial judge erred by using ""good character"" of the accused as a feature of aggravation such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 4 - The learned sentencing judge erred in that she failed to indicate the proportionality of discount to be applied by reason of the offender's plea of guilty.
Count 2 Ground of Appeal 5 - The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate effect to the finding that the applicant played a lesser role in the commission of the offence of conspiring with Khan Hoang Tran and Hong Phong Le to import into Australia goods to which s33B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, namely prohibited imports consisting of a quantity of heroin being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 6 - The applicant has a legitimate grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender Khan Hoang Tran, Hong Phong Le and Ngoc Thuan Nguyen such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 7 - The learned sentencing judge erred by using ""good character"" of the accused as a feature of aggravation such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 8 - The learned sentencing judge erred in that she failed to indicate the proportionality of discount to be applied by reason of the offender's plea of guilty.
Count 3Ground of Appeal 9 - The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate effect to the finding that the applicant paid a lesser role in the commission of the offence of trafficking substance, being a controlled drug, namely heroin and methylamphetamine, and the quantity being a marketable quantity such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 10 - The applicant has a legitimate grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentence imposed upon his co-offenders Khan Hoang Tran, Hong Phong Le and Ngoc Thuan Nguyen such that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
Ground of Appeal 11 - The learned sentencing judge erred by using ""good character"" of the accused as a feature of aggravation such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Factual background
5In June 2005, the Australian Crime Commission commenced an investigation into the money laundering activities of several money remittance businesses based in Melbourne and Sydney. The businesses were collectively known as the ""Long Tan Money Company (""the LTMC"").  The investigation was later expanded to include the alleged importation and trafficking of drugs by clients of the LTMC.  Investigators identified various illegal drug syndicates that were using the LTMC to deal with illicit drug money.
6The scope of the investigation involving the applicant focused principally upon members of a syndicate dubbed the ""Ken Syndicate"", so known because the head of the syndicate was Khan Hoang Tran, who was also known by the anglicised names ""Ken"" or ""Kenny"".
7Tran and another man, Hong Phong Le (""Phong Le""), were the principal members of the syndicate.  The pair was based in Sydney and worked closely together during the commission of the Ken Syndicate's money laundering, drug trafficking and drug importation offences.
8Between November 2005 and July 2006 the syndicate was involved in the business of importing and selling illegal drugs on a day-to-day basis.   Throughout this period a number of discrete importations and instances of trafficking illegal drugs were identified.
9The Ken Syndicate and its members in Sydney sold drugs to buyers in Melbourne. The drugs were couriered to Melbourne by various syndicate members. The buyers would remit money to Sydney for the purchase of the drugs. Purchase monies were remitted both before and after the delivery of the drugs.
10Tran or Phong Le would acquire the drugs through various means, including through the importation of drugs from Vietnam and through purchases from domestic suppliers.  The drugs would then be warehoused in Sydney until couriers were arranged to transport the drugs to Melbourne. Various types of drugs were acquired and sold by the syndicate, including heroin and methamphetamine.
11Tran or Phong Le would arrange with various members within the syndicate to act as couriers to transport the drugs to Melbourne, either by personally carrying the drugs with them on commercial airline flights or by transporting the drugs to Melbourne by car. The actual delivery of the drugs in Melbourne was arranged and facilitated through the Melbourne based members of the syndicate, including Ngoc Thuan Nguyen (""Ngoc Nguyen"") and the applicant.
12Payment for the drugs was effected by a number of different methods. On occasions the purchasers would deposit the money with the LTMC businesses based in Melbourne and request that it be sent to the corresponding businesses in Sydney for collection by Tran or Phong Le. On other occasions the purchase money would be provided directly to the couriers, who would either use the money remitting business to send it back to Sydney or simply bring the money back with them on their return. On other occasions, Ngoc Nguyen or the applicant would receive money for the buyers in Melbourne and would deposit it with the LTMC business in Melbourne for transfer to Sydney.
13The applicant, who was previously known as Be Van Tran, lived in Melbourne. He is the uncle of Phong Le. Throughout the period of the activities, the applicant was commonly referred to as ""Be"" or ""Uncle B"". The applicant carried out various tasks for the syndicate as and when required. The Applicant would generally carry out these tasks as directed or instructed by either Phong Le or Tran.
14The applicant was involved in each of the three conspiracies throughout the entire period of the charges. The Crown characterised the applicant as the Melbourne based ""branch manager"" for the syndicate. In the course of the three conspiracies, the applicant carried out a number of overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracies including:
(a)       arranging for the transfer of money from Melbourne to Sydney for the purchase of drugs;
(b) physically collecting money from buyers and couriers in Melbourne and depositing that money for transfer to Sydney;
(c) meeting with drug couriers who brought drugs from Sydney to Melbourne;
(d) warehousing drugs in Melbourne when required;
(e) arranging buyers for drugs in Melbourne when required;
(f) liaising with other syndicate members;
(g) arranging for couriers in Vietnam to bring drugs into Australia;
(h)       arranging for money to be provided to the syndicate's Vietnam heroin suppliers and couriers; (i)        travelling to Vietnam, together with Tran, in order to meet the syndicate's heroin suppliers; 
(j)        negotiating prices and amounts for the purchase of drugs with the Vietnam heroin suppliers; 
(k)       attending to the  syndicate's  operations in Melbourne according to theinstruction of Tran and Phong Le.
15Each of the three conspiracies was inter-related and formed the basis for thesyndicate's day-to-day illegal drug enterprise. The syndicate would use the proceeds from the sale of drugs sold to buyers in Melbourne to finance further importations and purchases of drugs, which in turn were then further on sold to buyers in Melbourne.  The cyclical process continued in this way throughout the entire course of the conspiracy, with the proceeds of the sale of the drugs being partially reinvested back into the enterprise.
Sentence proceedings
16The applicant's plea of guilty occurred on the eleventh day of trial after the Crown's principal witness, the applicant's nephew, Phong Le, had given evidence in chief, including extensive evidence regarding telephone intercepts that were tendered during the course of his evidence.  The applicant's plea occurred after the cross-examination of Phong Le had commenced.
17In the sentencing proceedings, the Crown tendered a Statement of Facts.  The applicant disputed certain aspects of the Statement of Facts, principally those that dealt with his role and participation in the conspiracies.  To enable the sentencing judge to resolve the dispute as to the facts, the Crown tendered excerpts of the telephone intercept material that had been relied upon and tendered during the trial.  The sentencing proceedings occupied six days in total.
18Having heard submissions, her Honour accepted the Crown's interpretation of the telephone intercept material and all of the facts as alleged in the Statement of Facts document tendered by the Crown.
19In relation to the objective circumstances of the offences, her Honour found:
""(a) The applicant carried out various tasks for the syndicate as and when required.  He would generally carry out these tasks as directed or instructed by either Phong Le or Tran.
(b) One of the applicant's main roles in Melbourne was to collect and remit drug purchase monies to facilitate the movement of drugs between New South Wales and Victoria.
(c) The applicant liaised with drug couriers for various purposes when they had arrived in Melbourne to deliver drugs.  On occasions the applicant also received or warehoused drugs that had been returned or rejected by the Melbourne buyers.  On occasions the applicant attempted to sell those drugs on behalf of the syndicate.
(d) The applicant introduced the syndicate to his drug contact in Vietnam (i.e. ""Dung"") and thereafter, together with Phong Le and Tran, the applicant was involved in the arrangements for the importation of heroin on behalf of the syndicate.
(e) On occasions when the applicant was in Vietnam, he would deal directly with the suppliers and couriers there.  At other times he would contact the same people by telephone from Australia and discuss prices, amounts and courier arrangements.  On other occasions, the applicant met or made arrangements to meet with couriers arriving in Australia, or paid couriers for importing drugs into Australia, on behalf of the syndicate.
(f) The applicant contributed money to partly finance the first importation of heroin from Vietnam for the syndicate in December 2005.
(g) In the latter half of May 2006, the applicant travelled to Vietnam and met with Tran for the purpose of arranging an importation of heroin for the syndicate.  While in Vietnam, the applicant contacted members of the syndicate and discussed arrangements for the importation and prices of heroin.  The applicant and Tran met with the supplier Dung in Hanoi where further negotiations took place.  The evidence established that the applicant was responsible for ""getting better rates"" for the heroin.
(h) In May, June and July 2006 the applicant was engaged in the selling of quantities of heroin that had been trafficked by the syndicate from Sydney to Melbourne, but which had been returned by disgruntled purchasers.
(i) Between 28 November 2005 and 23 July 2006 a minimum of 110 money remittances took place on behalf of the syndicate totalling in excess of $4,380,205.  Approximately $515,000 of this amount was sent from Australia to Vietnam on behalf of the syndicate.
(j) The applicant personally deposited or collected $533,000 during this period on behalf of the syndicate.
(k) The Ken syndicate was involved in an ongoing open-ended criminal enterprise involving the importation and domestic trafficking of substantial quantities of illicit drugs and the laundering of money to facilitate and finance these activities.
(l) The applicant's participation in the syndicate was within its upper ranks.  The applicant communicated directly with Tran and Phong Le, both of who were acknowledged as principals of the syndicate.
(m) The applicant's criminality was subordinate to Tran and Phong Le, although his role as the principal Melbourne agent for the syndicate's activities suggested that the extent of the departure from the sentences imposed upon Tran and Phong Le would not be great, after allowing for such factors as the pleas of guilty and the provision of assistance.
(n) The sentences imposed upon the applicant had to reflect his agreement to participate in three extensive criminal conspiracies as evidenced by the nature and number of overt acts carried out by the applicant over the course of the conspiracies.
(o) The substantial amount of the drug imported and/or trafficked in the course of the conspiracies was a relevant factor in assessing the applicant's criminality.  Similarly, the amount of money laundered by the syndicate and the fact that those funds were ploughed back into the purchase and distribution of illicit drugs, to the knowledge of the applicant, were important factors in sentencing on count 1 of the indictment.
(p) the offences were committed for financial gain, which must have been considerable.  The scale of the syndicate's activities had the potential to reap huge financial benefits for those involved, particularly in the upper echelons of the organisation.""
20Her Honour recognised that general deterrence was a fundamental factor in sentencing for these offences.
21With respect to the subjective circumstances of the applicant, her Honour took into account the following matters:
(a) He was born in South Vietnam in 1975 and was the second youngest of ten children.  The family arrived in Australia as refugees in 1982 and settled in Melbourne.  He was married in 2000 and has two young sons, both of whom reside with his wife in Melbourne.
(b) He had no criminal history and was of prior good character.  Her Honour noted that this was a factor that allowed him to travel freely for the purpose of engaging in drug trafficking, uninhibited by the scrutiny of the authorities.
(c) He had been in reasonably regular employment since leaving school after year 12 in Victoria.  He had operated a real estate agency between 1999 and 2005.  While on bail after his arrest, he had been working as an apprentice electrician and had completed the second year of his apprenticeship and wished to pursue a career in that field.
(d) He reported using methamphetamines during the period of the offences, largely under the influence of his co-offenders.
(e) He had expressed some remorse for the commission of the offences to the probation and parole officer and to the psychologist, Ms Seidler.  In doing so, however, he had not accepted full responsibility for his offending and had minimised his involvement by describing it as that of a ""debt collector"", ""runner"" and ""general factotum"" for one of the co-offenders in Sydney.
22In relation to discounts, her Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the offences, albeit on the eleventh day of trial and after the principal Crown witness had given evidence, and was partway through cross-examination.  Her Honour accepted that the applicant had facilitated the efficient conduct of the trial by making admissions under s184 of the Evidence Act 1995.  Her Honour noted that lesser sentences than might be appropriate were to be imposed to recognise his willingness to facilitate the course of justice.
Grounds of Appeal 1, 5 and 9 - The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate effect to the finding that the applicant played a lesser role in the commission of the offences such that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
23The applicant referred to her Honour's finding that his criminality fell to be determined as a subordinate to Tran and Phong Le.  The applicant drew attention to that which was stated in the Agreed Facts at par 8, p 3:
""The offender carried out various tasks for the syndicate as and when required.  The offender would generally carry out these tasks as and when directed or instructed by Khan Hoang Tran and Hong Phong Le.""
The applicant also referred to the Crown's submission in the sentencing proceedings at par 47, p 16.
""The offender did not have the same level of authority in the syndicate as the latter two and in most cases was subject to their authority and followed their instructions in relation to the overall operations of the syndicate ...
The Crown submits that the offender occupied a midlevel position in the syndicate hierarchy being below Tran and Phong Le, but well above that occupied by the syndicate's couriers and runners.""
24The applicant submitted that it was clear from these findings, the Agreed Facts and the Crown submissions, that her Honour sentenced him on a higher ranking than that material would warrant.  That error on the part of her Honour, he submitted, was reflected in the sentence which she imposed.
25The applicant submitted that although 110 remittances of money took place between 28 November 2005 and 23 July 2006 totalling in excess of $4,385,205, he was only personally involved with the deposit and collection of $533,000 during that same period.  The applicant submitted that this was a significantly lesser amount than the total remittances for the period and significantly less than the amount of $938,600 which was personally deposited by Ngoc Nguyen.  The applicant submitted that the remittances with which he was personally involved amounted to approximately 13 percent of the total.  He submitted that this percentage was a realistic indication of his subordinate role in the syndicate.
26The difficulty with those submissions is that her Honour had available to her the evidence which had been given in the Crown case over 10 days and in particular, the telephone intercepts and evidence of Phong Le.  Her Honour was not restricted to the Statement of Agreed Facts and the Crown submissions in making her factual findings.  
27There was no issue that the applicant's role was subordinate to that of Tran and Phong Le.  Nevertheless, her Honour characterised him as participating within the upper ranks of the organisation and as performing the role of the principal Melbourne agent for the syndicate's activities.
28Specifically, her Honour said:
""55 I accept the offender's criminality falls to be determined as a subordinate to Tran and Phong Le, although the offender's role as the principal Melbourne agent for the syndicate's activities suggests that the extent of the departure from the sentences imposed upon Tran and Phong Le ought not be great, after allowing for relevant factors such as the pleas of guilty and the provision of assistance.  The sentencing exercise should not be distorted by somewhat strained attempts at positioning the offender precisely within a notional hierarchy.
56 The sentences imposed upon the offender must recognise the offender's agreement to participate in three extensive criminal conspiracies, as evidenced by the nature and number of overt acts carried out by the offender over the course of the conspiracy.  These included arranging the transfer of money from Melbourne to Sydney for the purchase of drugs, physically collecting money from buyers and couriers in Melbourne and depositing that money for transfer to Sydney, meeting with drug couriers who  brought drugs from Sydney to Melbourne, warehousing drugs in Melbourne when required, arranging buyers for drugs in Melbourne when required, liaising with other syndicate members, arranging for couriers in Vietnam to bring drugs into Australia, arranging for money to be provided to the syndicate's Vietnam heroin suppliers and couriers, travelling to Vietnam together with Tran in order to meet the syndicate's heroin suppliers, negotiating prices and amounts of drugs with the Vietnam heroin suppliers and attending to the syndicate operations in Melbourne, according to the instructions of Tran and Phong Le.""
29The evidence clearly supported her Honour's findings with respect to those matters and therefore her conclusion as to the applicant's role and participation in the syndicate's operations.  As the evidence and her Honour's findings reveal, the applicant was involved in every facet of the illegal drug and money laundering enterprise and on occasions, exercised a substantial degree of autonomy and decision making, such as when he was entrusted with selling the poor quality drugs that had been returned by the Melbourne buyers.
30The difference between the amount of money remitted by the applicant to Sydney and that remitted by other syndicate members, such as Ngoc Nguyen, was not an appropriate basis for a submission that the applicant was in a subordinate or even equal position necessarily to Ngoc Nguyen.  Such an approach focuses upon the physical act of transferring the money and ignores the organisational nature of the conspiracies and the part played by the applicant in them.  The submission also fails to acknowledge the gravamen of the money laundering conspiracy offence.  The offence involved an agreement between the applicant and others to deal with money well in excess of $1 million with the intention that that money be used in part as a means of financing the ongoing drug importation and trafficking activities of the syndicate.
31These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Grounds of Appeal 2, 6 and 10:  The applicant has a legitimate grievance when his sentence is compared with the sentence imposed upon his co-offenders, Khanh Hoang Tran, Hong Phong Le and Ngoc Thuan Nguyen such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
32The applicant submitted that his position within the syndicate was analogous to that of Ngoc Nguyen.  He noted that she had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, a significantly lesser sentence than he had received.  This was despite the fact that she was the person in charge of syndicate activities in Melbourne and had been more active than him in remitting monies to Sydney.
33The applicant relied upon the description given by the Crown in submissions concerning the position of Ngoc Nguyen as follows:
""Ngoc Nguyen, she was the middle woman, the person in the syndicate who acted as the buyers' agent down in Melbourne. ... She was involved in the same offence in terms of conspiracy of trafficking a commercial quantity ... She was more involved than Mr Tuan in the matter.  She had pleaded guilty as well and was involved in the same money laundering as this offender.
In my submission, she was a person who was in the middle of the hierarchy.  In terms of their position, viz a viz one another, in my submission you will see the way Ms Nguyen was dealt with by Judge Solomon.  In terms of her involvement in the syndicate operation, in my submission whilst she was more heavily involved in the trafficking aspect she wasn't involved in the importation side;""  (T.7.21-14.12.2010)
34The applicant submitted that the significantly greater involvement of Ngoc Nguyen in the syndicate's activities in Melbourne was to be balanced against the importation activities of the applicant.  When that was done, even allowing for the significant discount which she received for her plea of guilty, the applicant said that he had a justifiable sense of grievance when her sentence was compared with his own.
35The applicant submitted that in order to appreciate his sense of grievance in relation to the sentences imposed upon Tran and Phong Le, it was necessary to assess as best one could what discount he had received from her Honour.  The applicant suggested that her Honour must have allowed a discount of about 15 percent.  If that were so, the starting point for the head sentence imposed by her Honour on him must have been about 14 years.
36The applicant submitted that one should compare that sentence with the sentence imposed on Tran of imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period of 11 years, and on Phong Le of imprisonment for 12 ½ years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months.  The applicant submitted that even allowing for a discount of 50 percent for an early plea and assistance granted to Phong Le and 40 percent for an early plea and assistance granted to Tran, the sentences imposed on him did not reflect the lower level of his criminality.  He submitted that his sentence was almost identical to that of the principals in the syndicate.
37The parity principle is an expression of the concept of equal justice.  It requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner.  However, the parity principle also allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances (Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 86 ALJR 36 at [28] - [30] ; Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610).   For the Court to intervene on the grounds of disparity, the difference in sentences between co-offenders must be ""marked"" or ""clearly unjustifiable"" or ""manifest"" ... ""such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance"".  A sense of grievance is ""justifiable"" when a reasonable mind looking over all of what happened would see that a grievance was justified (Green [30] - [32]; Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 at [50]).
38In the present case there are substantial differences between the objective and subjective circumstances of the offences and the offenders such as to justify any difference in the sentences imposed upon the applicant and his co-offenders.
39With specific reference to Ngoc Nguyen, she was only charged in respect of two conspiracies, i.e. to traffic in a commercial quantity of heroin and methamphetamine, and dealing with money to the value of $1 million or more intending that it would become an instrument of crime.  She was not charged with, nor was she involved in, the drug importation conspiracy.  This is a significant difference and it is not answered by the submission that Ngoc Nguyen's greater involvement in criminal activities in Melbourne is to be offset against the applicant's involvement in the drug importation conspiracy.
40The applicant's involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering in Melbourne was, as her Honour found, substantial.  She described him as the ""principal Melbourne agent"" of the syndicate.  Unlike Ngoc Nguyen, he also had a connection with Sydney in that much of the heroin importation came through Sydney.  Moreover, the applicant's involvement in the importation conspiracy was significant.  He introduced the syndicate to his drug contact in Vietnam, he dealt directly with suppliers and couriers from Vietnam, he negotiated prices with suppliers in Vietnam and travelled to and from Vietnam for the purposes of the syndicate.  The quantity of the drug imported was substantial.
41Not only was the criminality of the applicant greater than that of Ngoc Nguyen because of his involvement in the importation conspiracy, but she had the advantage of findings which were not available to him.  Because she had pleaded guilty at an early stage, a discount of 25 percent was allowed to reflect her willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  In her case, the sentencing judge accepted that her plea of guilty indicated contrition.  She was found to be suffering from depression which would make her time in custody more onerous than otherwise would have been the case.  Finally, the sentencing judge noted that there had been great delay before she was sentenced.
42In the applicant's case, her Honour was not prepared to find any significant level of remorse.  Although her Honour did not specify the extent of the discount which she was prepared to allow in the applicant's favour, it is clear from her comments that the discount would have been modest and much lower than the 15 percent suggested by the applicant in submissions.  The applicant's guilty pleas came after the Crown case was almost completed and were clearly an acceptance of the inevitable, rather than a genuine expression of remorse.  Of themselves they did not greatly facilitate the course of justice.  In that regard, her Honour said:
""64 The offender's remorse for the commission of these offences was expressed to the Probation and Parole officer responsible for preparing a report on 8 October 2010 (Exhibit B), and to a psychologist (Exhibit 1).  The offender acknowledged that he had done ""the wrong thing"" and that illicit drugs cause considerable damage within the wider community.  The offender was regretful that his incarceration had left his wife and children without support and had caused embarrassment within his local community in Melbourne.  To the extent that the offender accepted responsibility for his offending, he has minimised his involvement in the offences as a ""debt collector"", ""runner"" and general factotum for one of the co-offenders in Sydney.  It is difficult to accept the offender's statement that ""he thought his involvement at the time was all right because he was not the one who instigated the drug deals"", given the offender's undoubted sound intelligence and functioning.
65 I have already made findings of fact which completely undermine the offender's professed role in the syndicate's activities.  The equivocal nature of the offender's contrition and his attempts to avoid punishment commensurate with his criminality, explain the delay in entering pleas of guilty to the offences.  That is one of the significant distinguishing features between the offender and the majority of his co-offenders, including Tran and Phong Le, both of whom pleaded guilty at a relatively early stage following their arrest and received a substantial discount for the promise of assistance to the authorities.
66 However, the offender did substantially facilitate the efficient conduct of the trial, by way of the admissions made under s184 of the Evidence Act 1995.  The confinement of the issue at trial to the offender's participation in the relevant conspiracies significantly streamlined the Crown case.  In the absence of those admissions, it may have been necessary to play a very large number of intercepted telephone calls, in addition to proving a number of translations.  Accordingly, I have determined that a lesser sentence than might otherwise be appropriate ought be imposed in order to recognise the offender's willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  Ultimately, the sentence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences.""
43In those circumstances, the applicant can have no justifiable sense of grievance with respect to the sentence passed on Ngoc Nguyen.
44While Phong Le and Tran were sentenced for the same offences as the applicant, and were the principals in the syndicate and in the three conspiracies, there were significant differences in the circumstances relating to their sentences when compared with the applicant.  Phong Le had the advantage of a 50 percent discount for his early plea of guilty and substantial assistance to the authorities.  Accordingly, the starting point for his sentences, before the application of discounts, was imprisonment for 25 years with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months.  This was significantly higher than the sentence imposed on the applicant and it reflected the greater criminality of Phong Le when compared with that of the applicant.  The sentencing judge found genuine contrition and remorse on the part of Phong Le, a finding which her Honour was not prepared to make in respect of the applicant.
45Similarly, the co-offender Tran received a discount of 40 percent for his early plea of guilty and assistance provided to authorities.  Allowing for that discount, the start point for his sentences was imprisonment for 30 years with a non-parole period of 15 years.  That is significantly greater than that imposed on the applicant and adequately reflects the greater criminality of Tran.  Tran also had the advantage of a finding of genuine contrition and remorse for his offending and that there had been delay in sentencing.
46It follows that the applicant has not established a basis for any justifiable sense of grievance on his part by reference to the sentences imposed on Phong Le and Tran.
47On the issue of parity, the applicant submitted that her Honour had erred in partially accumulating the sentences which she imposed on him rather than making them concurrent, as had occurred with Ngoc Nguyen, Phong Le and Tran.  This, of course, does not raise a parity issue, but can be conveniently dealt with here.
48No error is disclosed in her Honour's approach to the structure of the sentences which she imposed, in particular the partial accumulation of the sentences for counts 2 and 3.  The question of whether to accumulate sentences is a discretionary matter for the sentencing judge (R v Hammoud [2002] NSWCAA 254; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]).  
49While the three conspiracies were interrelated and formed part of the one overall criminal enterprise, there was discrete criminality involved in each aspect of the offending.  In the applicant's case wholly concurrent sentences would produce a total head sentence of just 7 years imprisonment and would not adequately reflect the total criminality of his offending.  As her Honour specifically noted, anything less than a non-parole period of 8 years would fail to adequately give effect to the principle of general deterrence and would come perilously close to a penalty which was unreasonably disproportionate to the gravity of the offences.
50To the extent that it is legitimate to compare the sentences imposed on the applicant with those imposed on Ngoc Nguyen, Phong Le and Tran on this issue, it is noteworthy that each received a high head sentence in respect of their drug trafficking conspiracy offences and lesser fixed term concurrent sentences for the other conspiracy offences.  In contrast, the applicant received a 7 year sentence of imprisonment for his drug trafficking conspiracy offence.  It was not only open to her Honour to conclude that some accumulation of sentences was warranted in the case of the applicant, any lesser sentence would have failed to fully reflect the totality of the criminality associated with his active participation in three substantial conspiracies.
Grounds of Appeal 3, 7 and 11:  The learned sentencing judge erred by using ""good character"" of the accused as a feature of aggravation such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
51The applicant submitted that he had not previously been charged or convicted of any criminal offence.  He submitted that he was entitled to benefit from his prior good character.  He submitted that instead of doing so, her Honour had used his previous good character against him when she said:
""He has no criminal history but his prior good character was a fact that allowed him to travel freely for the purposes of engaging in drug trafficking, uninhibited by the scrutiny of the authorities.""  (ROS [61])
52The applicant submitted that this was not a case where he had held a position of public responsibility or trust, where good character may well have provided a special opportunity to embark upon criminal activity.  In a case such as this, he submitted, his previous good character should not have been relevant to penalise him for his criminal conduct.
53Prior good character of a person involved in a drug importation offence is generally to be given less weight as a mitigating factor on sentence.  This is because good character is not an unusual characteristic of persons involved in drug importation (Regina v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1 at [52] - [57]; R v Paliwala [2005] NSWCCA 221; 153 A Crim R 451 at 456-457; Okafor v R [2007] NSWCCA 147 at [47]; Onuorah v R [2009] NSWCCA 238; 76 NSWLR 1).
54It is not at all clear from what her Honour said that her Honour was taking the applicant's prior good character into account as an aggravating factor.  It is equally open to read her Honour's observation as going no further than to say in accordance with authority, that in this case the applicant's prior ""good character"" would not be of assistance to him.  Self-evidently, as her Honour noted, the applicant's prior good character was a factor which enabled him to travel freely and thereby engage in drug trafficking uninhibited by the scrutiny of the authorities.
55I am not persuaded that error of the kind identified has occurred.  These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Grounds of Appeal 4, 8 and 12:  The learned sentencing judge erred in that she failed to indicate the proportionality of discount to be applied by reason of the offender's plea of guilty.
56The applicant submitted that even though he entered a late plea of guilty, some discount should have been allowed.  Unfortunately, the authorities quoted by the applicant in support of this proposition were authorities which referred to the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, an approach which is not appropriate in Commonwealth offences.  The applicant suggested a discount of 10-15 percent.
57The applicant submitted that in any event, her Honour should have specified the extent of any discount that she was going to grant.  He submitted that her Honour should have allowed a further discount for his remorse because his early plea of guilty was itself indicative of remorse.  The applicant submitted that a finding of remorse should be made in circumstances when an early plea of guilty is entered.
58When sentencing for a Commonwealth offence, there is no requirement for the sentencing judge to specify a quantifiable discount for an offender's guilty plea.  The principles set out in R v Thomson, R v Houlton (2000) NSWCAA 309; 49 NSWLR at [155], do not apply to sentencing for Commonwealth offences.  When a Commonwealth offence is involved, a sentencing judge is required to take the offender's guilty plea into account in accordance with the principles stated in Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339.  The plea of guilty is taken into account as recognition of an offender's willingness to facilitate the course of justice but not on the basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing.
59Since the test in a Commonwealth offence is the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice, a relevant consideration (particularly in this case) is the strength of the Crown case.  This is because the strength of the Crown case may bear upon the question of whether the plea of guilty was motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or simply a recognition of the inevitable.  In this case the plea of guilty comes within the latter description.
60While a plea of guilty might of itself be indicative of remorse, her Honour was not bound to accept it as such.  This is particularly so when there were other indicia identified by her Honour to contrary effect, i.e. the late timing, the circumstances in which the plea was entered and the applicant's attempts to downplay his role in the conspiracies.  Significantly, the applicant did not give evidence himself to express remorse for his offending and the only references to remorse came from third party reports and letters of reference.  
61These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 13 - The learned sentencing judge failed to address issues relating to prospects for rehabilitation as required by s16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 appropriately at sentence.
62The applicant submitted that for the reasons which follow, he was a very good candidate for rehabilitation.  He had a good working history.  While on bail prior to the commencement of the trial, he had undertaken an apprenticeship as an electrician which he had partially completed.  It was his intention upon release to complete that apprenticeship.  He had a supportive family background with a wife and two children which was conducive to a successful rehabilitation.  A presentence report, dated 7 October 2010, identified the applicant as suitable to attend programs which would address his illicit drug use.  This recommendation was supported by the psychologist's report.
63Pursuant to s16A(2)(n), a court sentencing a federal offender is required to take into account matters that are relevant and known with respect to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation.  In the present case, the sentencing judge did not specifically refer to or make any particular finding with respect to, the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  
64Given the requirement of s16A(2)(n), it would have been preferable had her Honour made a finding in relation to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  There was clearly evidence which would have enabled her Honour to make a positive finding on that issue.  Equally, however, there was evidence which pointed the other way.
65Had her Honour considered the question of rehabilitation, she may well have found that the applicant's refusal to accept responsibility for the extent of his offending and his continued attempts to minimise his involvement in the offences, did not bode well for rehabilitation.  Her Honour's apparent unwillingness to find genuine remorse on his part was also not a positive factor suggesting successful rehabilitation.
66Accordingly, had her Honour turned her mind to the question of rehabilitation, it is by no means clear that her Honour would have made a finding favourable to the applicant.
67Alternatively, if the applicant's complaint of specific error with respect to the absence of a finding or assessment with respect to his rehabilitation prospects is made out, this is not demonstrative of error in the sentencing process.  It follows that I am of the opinion that the Court should not intervene and re-sentence the applicant since no other lesser sentences are warranted in all the circumstances.

		12 June 2012",2012-06-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708087,Dennis v R [2012] NSWCCA 120,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  After a trial lasting almost three weeks, the appellant was convicted of the murder of a 23 month old boy referred to in the proceedings as ""J"".  J was the son of the appellant's girlfriend.  The Crown's case was that J died as a result of injuries inflicted upon him by the appellant whilst J was in his care in the early hours of Friday 21 March 2008.
2The appellant's grounds of appeal are as follows:
""1. [The trial judge] failed to direct the jury that they had to find as an indispensable intermediate fact beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries to the child were occasioned to him between 2.00am and 3.30am when J was alone and in the sole care of the accused.
2. His Honour's treatment of the evidence with respect to the Crown contention that the injuries sustained to J were occasioned while J was alone with the appellant between 2.00am and 3.30am was unbalanced and unfair.""
3In addition the appellant sought leave to adduce new evidence on the appeal comprising mobile telephone records of two young women (referred to in the trial as ""N"" and ""E"") and evidence that there were three upstairs apartments in the unit block in which J died.  
THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL
4The evidence at the trial that may be relevant to the appellant's grounds of appeal and to his application to adduce new evidence was essentially as follows.  The summary is taken largely from the Crown's Summary of Trial which did not conflict with the case put by the appellant on appeal.
Ms Malcolm's evidence
5At the time of his death, J was living with his mother Ms Malcolm in a unit in Dubbo.  There also lived in the unit Ms Malcolm's other child, who was staying elsewhere on the night of J's death, and ""T "", a young woman who was studying at a TAFE College.  The appellant was Ms Malcolm's boyfriend and he slept at the unit about three nights a week.
6Early on the evening of 20 March 2008, Ms Malcolm, who was at the unit, and the appellant, who was then elsewhere, exchanged resentful text messages about Ms Malcolm going out that night.  At about 11.00 pm Ms Malcolm left the unit, T remaining behind to look after J who was then asleep.
7Ms Malcolm remained at a hotel until about 3.00 am.  Whilst she was there she received an angry text message from the appellant.  It was followed by a telephone conversation with him during which he asked her to ""come home"", the appellant then being at her unit.
8Ms Malcolm arrived home at about 4.00 am.  As she expected, the appellant was there.  She did not check on J but the appellant told her that J had fallen over in the shower and hurt himself.  On waking up the next morning she found that J did not ""look right"" and an ambulance was called.
T's evidence
9T said that she was at the unit when Ms Malcolm left between about 10.30 and 11.00 pm.  J was then asleep.
10After that, two young lady friends of T (E and N) came to visit her at the unit.  J was then awake.  E and N left after about 30 to 40 minutes.  About 20 minutes after they had left, the appellant arrived at the unit.  He put J in the shower as J was unsettled.  This was something J liked and the appellant apparently thought it might help to settle him.  While J was in the shower, T heard a bang like the sound of the shower door banging closed and heard the appellant say:  ""Are you all right Bubba?""  The appellant then brought J out and dressed him.  As T prepared to leave the unit J put his arms out as if to indicate that he didn't want T to leave.  
11T was picked up by Mr Boyd, the father of one of her friends, and driven to his home, where her friends were.  Mr Boyd then returned her to the unit between 3.00 and 3.30 am.  The appellant was asleep on a mattress in the lounge-room and said ""Don't turn the lights on because I've just put [J] to sleep"".  T entered J's room and checked him by the light of her mobile phone.  He appeared to be asleep, with his stomach moving up and down.  Just before she fell asleep T heard the appellant talking angrily on his phone, asking the person to whom he was speaking (undoubtedly Ms Malcolm) when she was coming home.
12T woke up the next morning when she heard Ms Malcolm screaming.  Later, when the police and ambulance officers were present, the appellant told her that he thought that J must have hit his head in the shower.  
E's evidence
13E gave evidence that she and N visited T at Ms Malcolm's unit on the night of 20 - 21 March 2008.  Whilst they were there, T picked J up out of his cot, and E played with him.  According to E, at this time J was smiling and happy.  She observed no bruises on him.  E and N were then picked up by Mr Boyd and driven to his house.  About an hour later T arrived, having been picked up by Mr Boyd. E's estimates of how long T stayed at Mr Boyd's house varied from half an hour to an hour, to two to three hours (Transcript p 280; witness statement [36]).  Mr Boyd drove her home.
N's evidence
14N gave evidence that she and E were dropped by Mr Boyd at Ms Malcolm's unit.  Whilst they were there, T got J out of bed.  J was up and playing when N and E were picked up by Mr Boyd.  Mr Boyd later collected T and brought her to his house where she did not stay long before he dropped her home again.
Mr Boyd's evidence
15Mr Boyd's son was a friend of N, E and T.
16At about midnight on 20 - 21 March 2008 Mr Boyd drove N and E to T's home, then later picked them up.  Whilst doing so he saw a child (clearly J) come outside with T.  
17About an hour after taking N and E back to his home, Mr Boyd collected T from her home and brought her to his place, at her request.  He drove T back to Ms Malcolm's unit at 3.30 am.  He recalled this specific time because he looked at the clock in his car as he dropped her off.
Mrs Watson's evidence
18Mrs Watson lived in a unit across the road from Ms Malcolm's unit.  
19In March 2008, Mrs Watson was pregnant and had trouble sleeping.  She woke at about 1.45 am on 21 March 2008.  As the weather was hot she opened the front door at about 2.00 am and sat in the doorway with a cup of tea.  She heard a baby crying.  She said that it was ""like a sick cry"".  The cry was coming from the units across the road.  The crying continued for about half an hour and was still occurring when she shut the door.  Whilst she was sitting in the doorway she caught a glimpse of a ""bigger"" lady walking into the foyer and going up the stairs.  She said that she looked like the girl that regularly went to the units (from the description given, it appears that she was referring to T).
20Her evidence included the following:
""Q. What time did you shut the door?A. It would have been between like 2 and 3.  It was like I can't, I can't quite remember but it was quite a period of time lapsed when I shut the door.
Q. How long did the crying go on for?A. Probably about half an hour, probably.
Q. Okay?A. As far as what I heard.  It could have gone longer because I shut the door and went to bed.
Q. I understand.  Was the crying still going on when you shut the door?A. Yes.
Q. Was there any break in the crying, or continuously?A. It was like a sick cry, like when my children are teething or fluey or sick, it was like just a sick, unhappy cry.
...
Q. Did you see any individual, any people in or around or in any area whilst you were sitting there?A. Yes, I did.
Q. What did you see?A. I saw a quite bigger lady walking into the foyer up the stairs.
Q. Walking sorry?A. Into the foyer of the flats up the stairs.
Q. I'm sorry, I interrupted you, continue?A. The foyer was quite lit up when someone was in there so you could see pretty much a silhouette of a person.  It was somebody, they were dressed up for going out kind of thing and they were going up the stairs.
Q. So where was that individual?  Did you say it was a woman?A. Yes.
Q. Did you say a larger sized woman?A. Yes.
Q. Where was she when you first saw her?A. I didn't quite see her in the darkness.  I heard like her walking past but I couldn't see her until up to the foyer where it was lit up and you could see.
Q. So you saw her in the foyer?A. Yes, going up.
Q. Going up.  All right?A. I wasn't quite staring, I just noticed.  It was just like a glimpse of somebody going up the stairs.
Q. Are you able to tell us about what time it was when you saw this lady?A. No, I can't remember, I'm sorry.
Q. Was the crying going on in this period of time?A. Yes, it still was.
...
Q. Did you see any motorcars in the area at that time?A. No, no.
Q. Did you hear any?A. No.
...
Q. You saw a woman entering the foyer of the flats and I assume, correct me if I am wrong, that that observation was for a very short time?A. Yes, it was a flash, yeah.
Q. She walked from the dark into the lit foyer and then disappeared?A. Yes"" (Transcript pp 66 - 68; 72).
The recorded interview with the appellant
21The Crown tendered a DVD recording and transcript of a police interview of the appellant.  
22In the interview the appellant said that when he arrived home on the night of 20/21 March 2008, J was up and crying.  To attempt to calm him, the appellant put J in the shower.  Whilst the appellant was in the kitchen he heard a ""bang"" and went into the bathroom and found J crying.  The appellant then got him out of the shower and dressed him.  After about 20 minutes lying on a mattress in the lounge room whilst the appellant watched TV, J fell asleep.  The appellant put him in the cot.  When the appellant awoke the next morning, J was not moving.
23The appellant described the bang he claimed to have heard as follows:
""I've heard him fall over before, in there ... and it sounded exactly like that again and ... and that's why I thought, you know, like, he's, oh, he's only had another little fall ... I didn't think anything of it, but I ... he was holding his chin ... and I knew, I thought that he'd hit, hit his chin, I knew, I could see a little bruise comin' up, and yeah, I laid him down ... "" (Questions 353 - 8).
The medical evidence
24Dr Randall, director of the Emergency Department at Dubbo Base Hospital, gave evidence that when J was brought into the hospital at about 10.55 am on 21 March 2008 he showed no signs of life.  After unsuccessful attempts to revive him, he was declared deceased.
25Dr Greenberg, also of Dubbo Base Hospital, confirmed that J showed no signs of life upon arrival at the emergency department.  He gave evidence that there was bruising under J's chin, over his left eye and behind both ears, and there were signs of bleeding behind the right ear drum (Transcript 13 October 2009, p 95).  CT scans that Dr Greenberg ordered revealed that J's skull was fractured.  In Dr Greenberg's experience, injuries of the magnitude suffered by J were usually associated with falls from a ""fair"" height, such as off a roof or a cliff, or from a car accident.  He said, ""I have never seen a child fall just from standing that has had a skull fracture like that [referring to J's injuries]"" (Transcript 13 October 2009, p 101).
26Dr Lyons, director of the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine, conducted a post-mortem examination of J and was of the view that his injuries had resulted from at least three or four applications of severe blunt force trauma to his head.  Dr Lyons observed characteristic patterns within the areas of injury on the right and left side and on the back of J's head.  At the unit where J had lived, Dr Lyons observed that the surface of some of the walls had a pattern on them that may well have led to the pattern of skin and soft tissue injuries observed on J.  
27Dr Lyons considered that the injuries that he observed would have each occurred around the same time and would have led to unconsciousness.  What he observed was consistent with the injuries being occasioned between 2.00 am and 3.30 am on 21 March 2008.  He did not consider that the injuries were consistent with J falling in the shower.  An observation at 3.30 am of J apparently asleep but with his stomach moving was consistent with the injuries having been suffered by then but J being unconscious.  
The appellant's case
28The appellant did not give evidence or adduce any other evidence.
GROUND 1:  INDISPENSABLE INTERMEDIATE FACT DIRECTION
29The appellant contended, in reliance on Shepherd v R [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573, that the trial judge should have directed the jury that to convict the appellant it had to find beyond reasonable doubt as ""an indispensable intermediate fact"" that the injuries to J were occasioned between 2.00 am and 3.30 am when J was in the sole care of the appellant.  The appellant submitted that ""it was critical in the logical process of reasoning to guilt"" that the jury would have to find this (Outline of Submissions [20]).
30The principles upon which the appellant relied were stated by Dawson J in Shepherd in the following terms:
""... it may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt.  Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character.  If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn.  But where - to use the metaphor referred to by Wigmore on Evidence, vol 9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), par. 2497, pp. 412-414 - the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so.  It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence"" (at p 579)
...
""The judgments in Chamberlain do not support the proposition that, in a case resting upon circumstantial evidence, the jury may only properly draw an inference of guilt upon facts - individual items of evidence - proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Still less does the case establish that a direction in those terms should be given to a jury.  Of course, it is recognized in Chamberlain that, if it is necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion of fact as an indispensable, intermediate step in the reasoning process towards an inference of guilt, then that conclusion must be established beyond reasonable doubt.  But to say as much is to do little more than state a truism.  It does not mean that each item of evidence taken into account in reaching that conclusion must, considered separately, be established beyond reasonable doubt.
Whether it is desirable for a trial judge to identify an intermediate conclusion of fact in his charge to the jury in order to instruct them that it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt will depend upon the particular case.  Such an instruction will only be possible where the conclusion is a necessary link in a chain of reasoning.  Even then, particularly when that is obvious, the instruction may not be helpful"" (at p 585).
31These principles were considered in Davidson v R [2009] NSWCCA 150; 75 NSWLR 150.  In rejecting the appellant's case that there had been a deficiency in directions given at the trial, Simpson J (with the concurrence of Spigelman CJ and James J) said:
""[74]  Whether a fact on which the Crown relies as part of a circumstantial case is or is not 'indispensable' may be tested by asking whether, in the absence of evidence of that fact, there would nonetheless be a case to go to the jury. If the answer is in the affirmative, even if the Crown case is weakened, even considerably, the fact is not 'indispensable'. Where the answer is in the negative, the fact is 'indispensable' and the jury should be directed accordingly. 
[75]  I do not accept that any of the proposed facts was 'indispensable' within the reasoning of Shepherd. Certainly, the telephone call evidence was very powerful, especially that of 2 March to which I have referred to above. But that does not make it 'indispensable' and, even without that evidence, there was still a case that incriminated the appellant.""
32The principles were further considered in Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 163; 196 A Crim R 199.  In that case the appellant contended that certain evidence described as the ""Pajero evidence"" related to an indispensable intermediate fact in the sense described by Dawson J.  In rejecting this submission the Court said:
""[133]  His Honour's direction was correct. The Crown case was not confined to the Pajero evidence in the sense that it was an indispensable intermediate fact. Although the primary thrust of the Crown case was that the Pajero evidence was the most likely means and time at which Mrs Whelan was abducted, it relied upon all of the circumstances of the case, including circumstances that had no direct link with the Pajero evidence or the other two main bodies of evidence ... "".
33The same approach was taken by this Court in Rees v R [2010] NSWCCA 84; 200 A Crim R 83 and in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21.  In Rees, Beazley JA pointed out that whilst the evidence in question was a strong piece of circumstantial evidence, it was not the only evidence that linked the appellant with the commission of the offences (see [55] and Wood at [555] - [570]).
34In the present case it was plainly essential that the jury conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the opportunity to commit the crime with which he was charged.  That was a matter of commonsense about which the trial judge was not required to give a direction separate from his explicit direction that the jury needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant murdered J.  
35Contrary to the implication in this ground of appeal and the appellant's submissions, it was not necessary for the jury to find that the appellant had the opportunity to murder J for the whole of the period between 2.00 am and 3.30 am on 21 March 2008.  It was critical that it find that the appellant had that opportunity at some stage within that period but it was not necessary for it to find that he had the opportunity for the entirety of the period.  Thus, proof that T returned home at 3.30 am, rather than at some other time in the previous hour, was not crucial.  There could be no doubt that the appellant was in fact alone with J for at least part of that period.  The appellant admitted as much in his interview with the police.
36It was clearly integral to the jury's task that it find that the injuries to J occurred whilst J was alone with the appellant and not, for example, when J fell in the shower whilst T and the appellant were at home with him, or after T and Ms Malcolm returned home.  Such a conclusion was obviously inherent in the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.  The manner in which the trial was conducted and in which the trial judge summed up to it, could not have left the jury in any doubt about this.  
37As Dawson J recognised in the passages from Shepherd quoted in [30] above, separate directions about facts indispensable to the accused's guilt need not be given where the point that would be made by the directions is obvious and covered by general directions as to the need for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt.  That was the position here.  This ground of appeal should accordingly be rejected.
GROUND 2:  HIS HONOUR'S TREATMENT OF THE EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE CROWN CONTENTION THAT THE INJURIES SUSTAINED TO J WERE OCCASIONED WHILE J WAS ALONE WITH THE APPELLANT BETWEEN 2.00 AM AND 3.30 AM WAS UNBALANCED AND UNFAIR
38The appellant first submitted in relation to this ground of appeal that it was inappropriate for the trial judge ""to continually challenge the evidence of Ms Watson via the s 165 direction as to identification"" in his Summing-Up (Written Submissions dated 29 November 2010 [21]).  I reject this submission.  His Honour repeated his warning to the jury about the potential dangers of Mrs Watson's identification evidence because that warning was first given immediately prior to an adjournment due to the illness of a juror in circumstances suggesting that that juror may not have been well enough to concentrate sufficiently when the warning was given.  The trial judge told the jury that he was ""going to back track"" for that reason (Summing-Up, 23/10/09, p 33).  There was not in my view any unfairness in the course taken by his Honour.
39The appellant next submitted that to give a balanced treatment of the evidence, the trial judge should have referred to the following matters in his Summing-Up:
(a) The absence of evidence from the Crown of police inquiries that had been made to identify any young woman, other than T, whom Mrs Watson might have seen from across the road and any child, other than the deceased, whom Mrs Watson may have heard crying.
(b) The potential for witnesses, including Mr Boyd, to be mistaken in their estimates of time.
(c) The potentially unreliable nature of the evidence of T, N and E due to their excessive consumption of alcohol on the night of J's death.
40I do not consider that the absence of reference to these matters rendered the trial judge's Summing-Up ""unbalanced and unfair"".  It is of prime significance in this respect that no relevant complaint was made at the trial.  That the experienced counsel who appeared for the appellant apparently did not perceive any relevant lack of balance or unfairness in the Summing-Up is a strong indication that there was none.  
41The appellant adduced evidence from his solicitor that his counsel became ill during the trial and was unable to attend court on the day when the Summing-Up was completed.  However most of the Summing-Up was delivered prior to the Court adjourning on Friday 23 October 2009.  Counsel was present during the Summing-Up on this and on the previous day when it commenced.  He was absent on Monday 26 October 2009 but the Summing-Up was completed soon after the start of the hearing on that day.  
42There were a number of occasions on Friday 23 October 2009 when the appellant's counsel raised issues with the trial judge concerning the Summing-Up.  He had ample opportunity then to raise the matters of present complaint which, if there were any foundation for them, related to the Summing-Up delivered on the days when counsel was present.  Alternatively, if counsel had had in mind at the Friday adjournment raising further matters at the conclusion of the Summing-Up, he would undoubtedly have communicated them to his solicitor to enable them to be raised in his absence on Monday 26 October 2009.
43In further response to the submissions referred to in [39] above, I add:
(a) The appellant's counsel did not raise this point in his address at the trial.  It was not incumbent upon the trial judge to formulate the argument himself.  Even if counsel had put the point in address, it would have been a matter of argument to which the trial judge was not bound to refer in his Summing-Up (Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at 560 - 1).
(b) There is no general obligation on a trial judge to give a direction concerning the unreliability of estimates of time.  In any event, Mr Boyd's evidence was not of an unaided estimate but that he observed the time shown on the clock in his car.
(c) This point was made by the appellant's counsel in his address.  Moreover, in his Summing-Up on 22 October 2009, the trial judge observed:
""On the evidence of [E and N], [T] had a lot to drink.  [T] herself played down any suggestion that she had much to drink or was affected by alcohol on the night.  You heard a long series of submissions about that which I will not repeat, and [counsel for the appellant] made many other criticisms of her.  He submitted to you that she was an unreliable witness"" (p 23).
In my view there was no unfairness to the appellant in the trial judge saying no more than this and not repeating counsel's reference to E and N also drinking heavily on the night in question.
44In these circumstances, I discern no good reason to grant leave to the appellant to raise for the first time on appeal the points made in connection with this ground of appeal.  As a result, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules precludes him from doing so and this ground of appeal must be rejected.
NEW EVIDENCE SOUGHT TO BE ADDUCED
45As noted earlier, the appellant sought leave to adduce on appeal two categories of new evidence.
46The first category comprised mobile telephone records of N and T.  It was not suggested that these records were unavailable to the appellant at the time of his trial.  The appellant's submissions concerning the records related to a call that the records revealed was made by N to T at 2.49 am on the night in question.
47The appellant submitted that:
(a) The evidence given at the trial indicated that this call must have been made to T whilst she was being driven home by Mr Boyd.
(b) Because of the shortness of the drive, T must have arrived home before 3.00 am.
(c) Her arrival home at this time was consistent with, and supportive of, Mrs Watson's evidence that some time between 2.00 am and 3.00 am Mrs Watson saw someone who resembled T arrive at the building across the road from her.
(d) The evidence therefore indicated that Mr Boyd's evidence that he dropped T home at about 3.30 am was unreliable.
48On one level, the precise time at which T returned home is immaterial because, whatever that time may have been, there is no doubt that there was a period of time in which the appellant was alone in the unit with J and had the opportunity to commit the crime of which he was convicted.  The appellant's record of interview made this plain.
49The evidence of Mrs Watson that was of particular significance was that she heard a baby crying at the time that she observed a person resembling T arrive at the building opposite.  The appellant contended both at the trial and on appeal that this evidence should be accepted and that it should be inferred that the baby that Mrs Watson heard crying was J and that the person she observed arriving was T, with the result that J must have been alive when T arrived home and the Crown case that the appellant assaulted and killed J whilst J was alone with the appellant had to fail.  It is implicit in the jury's verdict finding the appellant guilty of murdering J that it rejected this argument.
50The telephone record evidence that the appellant seeks leave to adduce on appeal does not bear directly upon the questions of whether Mrs Watson observed T arriving home and whether she heard J crying when that occurred.  Rather, it is contended to be indirectly relevant to those issues by supporting Mrs Watson's recollection as to time and contradicting Mr Boyd's evidence of the time at which he dropped T home.
51Contrary to the appellant's submissions, the evidence given at the trial did not however indicate that the 2.49 am call from N to T must have been made whilst T was being driven home.  
52It should first be noted that T gave evidence that whilst she was at Mr Boyd's home, she made a mobile telephone call to N whom she knew to be in another room in the house with Mr Boyd's son (Transcript 15/10/09, p 242).
53Secondly, N gave evidence that at one point whilst she was at Mr Boyd's home, she, T and Mr Boyd's son were in the latter's room.  T then left the room and shut the door.  N gave evidence as to what followed:
""Q. Did you call [T] on the mobile phone after that?A. I don't remember.
Q. Did you perhaps say this to her, 'Where are you?  Do you have the shits with me'?A. I might of but I don't remember that.
Q. And she answered 'No, I'm just on my way home'.  You said, 'Well, I'll ring you later'.  Remember that?A. I don't remember but ...
Q. You wouldn't deny that it [was] possible?A. Yeah, probably.  That is probably what did happen but I don't remember it"" (Transcript 16/10/09, p 340 - 341).
54In light of this evidence, I do not consider that the jury would, or should, have attached any particular significance to evidence from mobile telephone records, if it had been admitted at the trial, that N made a call to T at 2.49 am.  As illustrated by T's evidence quoted above, the fact that a call was made by N to T did not necessarily indicate that N and T were not both at Mr Boyd's house and the evidence given by N that I have quoted did not reveal that she had any recollection of the circumstances or contents of that call.  The witness statement of N that presumably inspired the cross-examiner's questions was not in evidence.
55In these circumstances, I do not consider that there is any reasonable prospect that the telephone records, if admitted into evidence at the trial, would have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt or would have given rise to a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant.  As a result the appellant should be refused leave to adduce this evidence (see R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]; Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61 at [303]; 207 A Crim R 411).
56The other evidence sought to be tendered on appeal is evidence that the building in which Ms Malcolm's unit was situated had only two other upstairs apartments.  The appellant contends that this evidence indicates that it was less likely that Mrs Watson saw a person other than T enter the building at the relevant time.  However I do not accept that this evidence has the required degree of cogency to permit it to be tendered for the first time on appeal.  The appellant did not suggest that the evidence would not have been available to the appellant if the appellant's representatives had thought that evidence on the topic was material and had sought to obtain it.  If admitted at the trial it would, in my view, have been no more than one relatively minor piece of arguably relevant evidence amongst the significant body of evidence bearing much more directly upon the reliability of Mrs Watson's evidence.  In my view, there is no significant possibility that its availability to the jury at the trial would have led the jury, acting reasonably, to acquit the appellant.
57As I do not consider that any miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the jury not having before it the evidence sought to be tendered for the first time on appeal, leave to tender that evidence should be refused.
ORDERS
58For the reasons given, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.
59ROTHMAN J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.
60DAVIES J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2708088,R v Lloyd [2012] NSWDC 184,"SenTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Appearing for sentence today is Bryan William Lloyd. He pleaded guilty on 5 October last year to five offences, all of them committed many years ago. They are offences of great seriousness, involving the sexual assault of two young boys, brothers A and B. 

2Before I proceed any further, I should make an order that there is to be no publication of anything which would identify or tend to identify the names of the complainants in this matter.

3Sentencing for offences that occurred so long ago, particularly child sexual assault offences, provides particular problems, one of which is in determining the sentences that would have been imposed had there not been the substantial delay which often exists between offence and sentence. The authorities tell us, as sentencing judges, that we are to sentence according to the sentencing regime and tariff that existed at the time, rather than at present.

4There is much to be said for the view that in one sense that fails to take account of what is now more understood about offences of this type. Mason P, although he was in the minority as regards this aspect of the way offences of this kind should be dealt with, said that to sentence according to the regime that existed at the time is to perpetuate the error which has now been identified in sentences imposed many years ago. But, of course, he was in the minority and it is my task to seek to identify what would have happened to Mr Lloyd had he been dealt with soon after he committed these offences, taking into account, of course, that in the intervening years he has led a life where none of these offences have been repeated.

5The offences occurred after A and B became involved in activities at the Windale Police Citizens Youth Club. The offender was an attendee and a volunteer at that club. He turned twenty-three in 1989. In that year A was twelve and then thirteen and B turned twelve. There was thus a significant disparity in their ages. Although the offender was still relatively youthful, he was an adult and in a position of responsibility within the club. Both the young boys were entitled to look towards Mr Lloyd to care for them and protect them. Instead, he took advantage of his position to abuse them.

6It was the practice of some people involved with the club to sleep overnight when there were activities occurring over the weekend. The offender and A on one occasion slept overnight, sleeping on mattresses in one of the squash courts. A went to sleep fully clothed. The offender was on a mattress beside him. During the course of the night A was woken by what he described as a tickling sensation to his upper thigh. He had been asleep. The offender had taken advantage of that to molest A by sucking his penis.

7A realised what was happening, he realised that his pants had been pulled down and that the offender was sucking his penis and pretended to be asleep. The offender continued until A ejaculated. They both went back to sleep after A went to the toilet and cleaned himself up. Nothing was said about this incident between them the next morning.

8On another Saturday night a similar thing occurred. Again A woke up to find his erect penis being sucked by the offender. It continued again until A ejaculated and once more they both went back to sleep.

9These were not isolated matters. Although the offender is to be sentenced, of course, for these two matters only, he cannot say that they were isolated in the sense that they were the only two occasions on which acts of this kind occurred. The statement of facts reveals other matters.

10A then ceased to be involved in the PCYC. 

11Other activities within the club included fishing. The two young boys went fishing with the offender and a friend of his to Swansea and they camped overnight in two small tents. B went to sleep in one of the tents and woke to find the offender lying close beside him. He became aware that his shorts and underpants had been pulled down and he could feel something in his bottom. When he pulled away the offender asked him why he did that. B pulled his clothes up and went back to sleep.

12After that the offender began touching B on his penis whenever they were at the PCYC, whenever they were alone. The incidents that I have just described are not the subject of specific charges on the indictment. What I will now describe is.

13One day the offender took B into what is described as ""the band room"". He closed the door behind them and he pulled B's shorts and underpants down. He got B to lie on his stomach over some gym equipment and he tried to put his penis into B's bottom. B describes a sticky sensation and the offender pushed his penis in and out of his bottom for a short time. That is an offence of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and fifteen. As I said before, B was twelve at the time.

14Similar anal intercourse took place on many other occasions, sometimes in the toilet block at the football oval in Windale. On one of those occasions, the subject of count 4 on the indictment, the offender and B had been fishing until just on dark. They went back to Windale and the offender went to his home for a short time before driving B to the toilet block. They went inside and the offender smeared Vasoline on his penis before pulling B's pants and underpants down. B bent forward and the offender put his penis in B's bottom, pushing it in and out for a short time. After he was finished he drove B home.

15Of course, given his age and given the activity that I have described, not surprisingly, most times B felt pain in and around his bottom for the night and into the following day.

16B tried to put some distance between him and the offender but the offender was not going to let that happen. He told B that what had happened was not going to happen any more and that they would just go fishing. It appears that B, believed him but he should not have. 

17On one occasion, the subject of count 5 on the indictment, they fished at Belmont. Once more, they drove back to Windale and once more the offender went to his house before driving to the toilet block. Inside the toilets the offender put Vasoline on his penis, pulled his underpants and pants down and bent B forward, again having penile anal intercourse with B before driving him home. Count 5 represents the last occasion there was any sexual contact between the two.

18It was not until very many years later that the matters were drawn to the attention of the police. Ultimately A, in circumstances that he outlined in his moving victim impact statement which he read to the court, went to police on 19 March 2007. The police then approached B who made a statement in March 2009. By now the offender had moved to Queensland. He was approached by police in November 2010 and told that allegations of this kind had been made against him. The offender was then charged.

19The offender is a very different person now to the one he was back in the late 1980s and early 90s. He had a good upbringing with a family that was close and remains close. Indeed, references were tendered today from many of Mr Lloyd's family members. Notwithstanding that the family members now know about what he did many years ago, he retains the support and love of his family.

20There is nothing surprising about Mr Lloyd's upbringing as regards his education and work history. Indeed, he appears to have applied himself to employment with some enthusiasm after leaving school at a relatively early age. 

21However, there was one particular aspect of his upbringing which was abnormal. At about the age of thirteen he was sexually abused by a paternal uncle. He felt unable to tell his parents about this for both emotional and financial reasons. That experience appears to have been attributed, by him at least, as a cause of him commencing to use drugs and specifically cannabis, although, as the psychologists report, that the misuse of that substance was modelled and encouraged by the offender's then peers. His academic performance suffered and he ultimately left school. He has offences on his criminal history relating to cannabis use from around that time. 

22A very positive thing, however, happened in 1990 and that was when he met his now wife. She and the offender have had a close and loving relationship for many years. She was aware of the offender's cannabis abuse and was important in him ultimately giving it up. She stood by him over the years as he provided further challenges, at one time taking up gambling with some enthusiasm but she remains supportive of him and gave evidence on his behalf today.

23They have three children. One of them has recently undergone some tests in relation to what may turn out in the future to be a form of cancer. Although he has experienced symptoms for many years, medical investigations were only undertaken recently and they are not complete. The diagnosis at this stage is unknown. There is, however, a possibility, which everyone fears, that the diagnosis may ultimately be one of cancer. At this stage we simply do not know what the outcome will be.

24I mentioned before that A had read his victim impact statement to the court. It spoke eloquently of the sort of harm that offences of this kind cause. Indeed, the consequences that A spoke about are entirely predictable. In fact, it is a growing awareness of the harm that is caused by offences of this type which has led to a significant increase in penalty, both imposed by the courts and provided for by the legislature over the past thirty years.

25No victim impact statement was tendered by the Crown in relation to A's brother B but, of course, that does not mean he has not been harmed; far from it.

26Of course, part of the harm that A has experienced and part of the problems he has had with his life over the years is due to the position he was in when he first went to the PCYC. He was at that time being sexually abused by his step-father.

27One of the most important aspects in determining the culpability of the offender would concern whether he was aware that A was being molested by his step-father at the time he, the offender, sexually abused him. There was a somewhat surprising episode during these sentencing proceedings concerning that aspect.

28Mr Preece who appears for the offender conceded that the facts revealed that the offender had such knowledge. When I was unable to identify the relevant passage in the statement of facts that had been tendered by the Crown, it became apparent that Mr Preece was reading from a document which differed from the one which was tendered. The one I had, the one which had been tendered, was silent on this aspect.

29The upshot was that it was agreed between Mr Preece and the Crown that I should sentence on the basis of the facts that had been tendered and ignore what was put by Mr Preece, suggesting that the offender had the relevant knowledge.

30Of course, I will do precisely that. I will sentence on the basis of the evidence and I repeat ""evidence"" that is put before me. I will not take into account what Mr Preece read to me from his document. I cannot let the matter pass, however, without commenting on this state of affairs.

31Charge bargaining is an important part of the criminal justice system, allowing matters to be dealt with efficiently. Indeed, were it not for charge bargaining there would need to be many more judges and many more courts. But the public is entitled to be concerned at what sometimes occurs.

32It is one matter for negotiations as to appropriate charges to be had between the parties, but where those negotiations extend to misleading the sentencing judge things are of an entirely different character. Judges continue to be concerned about agreed facts where guns disappear, people act alone rather than in company and, in this case, a judge is not told about the very important aspect which would otherwise affect the moral culpability of the offender.

33I repeat, none of what I have just said will influence me in the sentence I will impose upon the offender. It is to be hoped it influences others, however, in the way they approach charge bargaining. Judges continue to be concerned at being kept in the dark, or indeed even misled, about what has actually occurred when they come to sentence.

34I turn now to one of the most important aspects which will determine the appropriate sentence to impose in this case. It concerns, of course, the delay between the offending and the present day.

35I must sentence the offender for the person he is today. He has demonstrated that since the last of these offences he has changed considerably and he is no longer the man he was when he committed these offences. He is not just promising rehabilitation, he has demonstrated it in a very concrete way. He has led a blameless life for many years and is entitled to be proud of what he has achieved. He is entitled to take advantage of the significant delay in that way.

36The authorities often speak about a significant measure of leniency being extended to the offender in circumstances such as these. On the other hand, as the Crown pointed out, this is a case where the offender, apparently for many years, was able to put these matters behind him. It is not a case that the offender lived in fear of the knock on the door, which would lead to this day ultimately arriving.

37He got on with his life and lived it happily, marrying his wife and having three children who clearly love him.

38In determining the moral culpability of the offender I do take into account how the offender was at the age of twenty-three. As I said, he himself had been abused and he himself was abusing cannabis. These two circumstances led to him being less able to reason about the rightfulness and wrongfulness of his conduct than would otherwise be the case. 

39Although the offender has continued to suffer from dysthymia over the years, he is, as I repeat, a very different person now to the person he was back then. He has recently had some physical and mental difficulties. As far as his physical health is concerned he has had a few problems which have been put before me. In particular he suffers from sleep apnoea and suffered from a mini stroke a little while ago. He has had the odd injury as well. Mentally, I mentioned dysthymia and a problem with gambling. He will do his time in custody harder because of those two circumstances.

40There are other circumstances which suggest that the offender will do his time in custody harder than he would in the general prison population as well. Mr Preece tendered some extracts from Facebook, in particular what appeared to be the Facebook page of A. In it A alludes to the possibility of the offender being harmed whilst in custody. I mention the following circumstance only to put this matter into context. A has done time in prison and therefore the threats that appear in the Facebook page might be thought to have some additional weight because of that circumstance. 

41The offender will no doubt feel at least apprehensive about serving a sentence of full time custody because of the contents of the Facebook page and the identity of the person whose Facebook page it was. Allied to that is the circumstance that there is a real risk that the offender will serve a sentence of full time custody on protection and if he does, there is a real risk also that the conditions of custody will be more onerous than those in the general prison population. 

42It is hard to be more definitive than that. I heard evidence from a corrective services officer Darren Wells about the differing levels of protection and the various consequences for an offender of serving a sentence on protection in various gaols around the state. As the authorities tell me, I take into account, as I have said, the risk that he will serve his sentence on protection and the risk that this will involve conditions of custody which are more onerous than those in the general prison population.

43Whilst dealing with that matter I will speak again about the health issue that faces the offender's son. He will of course prefer to be with his family at such a difficult time. A sentence of full time custody would be more onerous for that reason as well. The offender will know that through his actions many years ago he has deprived his family and in particular his son of his support as the investigations into his son's health continue.

44I was provided with what were said to be comparative cases by both Mr Preece and the Crown. The Court of Criminal Appeal, or at least the majority, in Ritter v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 121 and in other cases has referred to appeals where counsel rely on a limited number of cases and seek to derive from those cases sentencing principles and tariffs. No two cases are alike, of course. That point has been made on many occasions and although the cases that both the Crown and Mr Preece gave me were helpful, I have to bear in mind that the charges were different, the facts were different, the offenders were different and ultimately out of all those cases which could have been provided to me I was given only nine. Although, as I said, I do find them helpful, I also rely on the maximum penalty as indicating the appropriate sentence that should be imposed for an offence and offender in the worst category of offending and my own instinctive synthesis as to the appropriate sentence guided as it is by my experience of the criminal law way back in the late eighties and early nineties.

45The offender as well as demonstrating good prospects of rehabilitation, and being unlikely to re-offend, expressed his remorse. Those expressions appear in the psychologist's report tendered today. There is one qualification to that and that concerns the offender's late plea of guilty. It would have been better for the offender to have admitted what he had done earlier, but I do not regard that as significantly affecting my conclusion that the offender is sorry for what he has done. Of course, the plea of guilty coming late nevertheless still has a utilitarian value and I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about ten per cent to reflect that circumstance.

46There are five offences for which the offender must be sentenced involving two complainants. It is accepted that there should be a level of accumulation. I will do that. I will accumulate the sentences involving B partially on the sentences involving A. Indeed I could have accumulated to a greater extent as well and were I not told by the authorities to extend as much leniency as possible to the offender because of delay, I would probably have done so. 

47Both complainants are entitled to think that having committed one offence, the offender is not being punished for any other offence involving the same complainant. In one sense that is true, but applying the principle of totality I am satisfied that the outcome I will now announce is the appropriate one.

48It is undeniable that it is a significant punishment to send a person to gaol for any period of time at the age that Mr Lloyd now is, but nevertheless that is a necessary outcome given the gravity of his conduct even in circumstances where since then he has led a blameless life. The Crown did not oppose a finding of special circumstances. 

49The sentences I impose are as follows:

50For counts 1 and 2 I impose a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed term of 18 months to date from today, 12 June 2012. On counts 3, 4 and 5 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I impose a non-parole period of 12 months and a period of eligibility for parole of 18 months to date from 12 December 2012, the non-parole period will expire on 11 December 2013 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. 

51The overall sentence consists of a non-parole period of 18 months and a total sentence of three years.

2708091,Carroll v R [2012] NSWCCA 118,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J and with his reasons.
2JOHNSON J: I agree with Garling J.
3GARLING J:  This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales, by his Honour Judge Puckeridge on 25 November 2010.
4The applicant, Peter Carroll, pleaded guilty before Puckeridge ADCJ to one offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
5The offence related to the wounding by the applicant of Anthony Staunch with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm on 5 January 2010.  
6The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 7 years applies.
7The sentencing Judge imposed an overall sentence of 8 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 28 January 2010, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested.  
Facts8A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge.  A brief summary of these facts is set out below.
9At about 8.50am on 5 January 2010, the victim, Anthony Staunch, was driving his courier van approaching the Niagara Park Shopping Centre.  The applicant, Peter Carroll, pulled out from the exit driveway of the carpark in his Holden Statesman vehicle, onto Washington Avenue.  As the applicant pulled in front of Mr Staunch's van, Mr Staunch had to brake suddenly to avoid a collision.  At the same time, he shook his head in apparent disapproval of the applicant's manner of driving.
10Both vehicles continued driving normally along Washington Avenue for some relatively short distance.  The applicant suddenly stopped his vehicle in the middle of the road, which caused Mr Staunch to stop close behind the applicant's vehicle, having slammed his brakes on.
11The applicant alighted from his car and started yelling and screaming at Mr Staunch.  Mr Staunch then got out of his van, and a verbal exchange occurred.  At the conclusion of the verbal exchange the applicant commenced walking towards Mr Staunch.  
12Mr Staunch, fearing that he was going to be assaulted, grabbed a piece of wood from his van which he held in his right hand above his head in a protective stance.  As the applicant was walking towards him, Mr Staunch yelled ""Back off and leave me alone"".
13The applicant then turned around and ran back to his motor vehicle.  He removed from the pocket of the driver's door, a silver coloured knife which was about 30cm long with a blade approximately 5cm wide.  He moved towards Mr Staunch and his van.
14Mr Staunch tried to get back into his van.  At the same time, he heard the applicant yell ""I'm gonna cut you"".  The applicant then ran towards Mr Staunch who was, by that stage, almost back in his van.
15Mr Staunch managed to close the door of his van, but his driver's window was still open.  The applicant, who by that time was standing next to the front door of the van, put his arm inside the van and swung the knife at Mr Staunch who put his right arm up to protect himself and leaned away from the open window towards the passenger's side of the van.  
16The applicant swung the knife at Mr Staunch's right forearm causing it to bleed.  Mr Staunch, unsurprisingly, lowered his arm.  The applicant then swung the knife at his face, which caused a slash across Mr Staunch's face from his mouth towards his ear.
17The applicant then ran back to his car and drove off quickly.  
18Mr Staunch was taken to Gosford Hospital by ambulance where he underwent surgery on both wounds.  His wounds were sutured.  
19He suffered one wound extending 8cm from the corner of his mouth towards his ear.  This wound cut through to the interior of his mouth.  He also had surgery on an 8cm wound to his forearm that was approximately 4cm deep.
20On 28 January 2010, the applicant attended the Gosford Police Station to make contact with the police.  When the police told him that they had been looking for him for some time, he replied: ""Yeh, but I had things to do, mental health things and go to the doctor"".  
21After proceedings in the Local Court, the applicant was arraigned in the District Court of NSW on 18 October 2010.  On that day he pleaded guilty to the offence, which has been described above.  The proceedings were stood over for submissions on sentence. Those submissions were heard on 25 November 2010, upon which date he was sentenced by Puckeridge ADCJ.  
Applicant's submissions on sentence in District Court22The applicant agreed with the facts set out above.  The applicant did not give any evidence himself, but his de facto partner, Ms Sandy Bird, gave oral evidence.  
23A psychiatric report of Dr Allnutt dated 2 August 2010 was tendered, as was a reference from a previous employer.  The applicant's counsel made submissions.  
24Ms Bird gave evidence that she had been the applicant's partner for about 14 years.  They had a daughter together, but she said that the applicant treated her two sons from an earlier relationship, as his own and raised them as though they were his natural children.  She gave a history of the applicant's background which included friction with his mother, as a consequence of which he did not live with her whilst growing up but had been raised by his grandmother.  He had a history of smoking marijuana and she said, although he required medication for a neurological condition, he did not take it because he could not afford it.
25She reported that she had continued to visit the applicant whilst he had been in custody and that she had observed that since he was taking a new regime of medication, he was a lot better, much easier to get along with and a lot calmer.  
26The evidence of Dr Stephen Allnutt in his report of 2 August 2010, which was not subjected to any cross-examination by the Crown, was that the applicant had suffered head injuries in 1999 and 2002.  Both of these head injuries resulted in admission to a hospital and both had been associated with a loss of consciousness and a mild pre and post-injury amnesia.  
27Apparently the applicant told Dr Allnutt that he had never had any formal neuropsychological testing but that as a consequence of his head injuries, he had seizures commencing about one month after the first head injury, in the form of chronic seizures (grand mal seizures).  He also reported extensive pre-existing cannabis and heroin usage, together with extensive alcohol usage.
28Dr Allnutt was provided with some documentation from the Wentworth Area Health Service, which related to the treatment of the applicant following upon each of his previous head injuries.  The documentation noted the existence of head trauma followed by episodes of seizures.  The reports noted that the applicant was almost always violent when post-ictal and that his diagnosis was probably one of focal epilepsy with secondary generalised seizures.
29Dr Allnutt set out the contents of a letter from Dr Fung of 18 February 2003, in these terms:
""There was a letter by Dr Fung dated 18 February 2003 noting that he had been seizure free since commencing Tegretol; he was also taking Dilantin; that he had side effects of worsening of mood with poor temper control as well as headaches; that he also continued to have loss of appetite and a loss of weight.""
30Dr Allnutt expressed this opinion:
""He has ... suffered a head injury with associated loss of consciousness and has been diagnosed with seizure disorder secondary to his head injury; he describes that there has been a significant change in his behaviour and noted by others, that he has become more irritable, more prone to a class of aggression, has more difficulty within the workplace as far as functioning is concerned and that there has been a change in the quality of his interpersonal relationships. ...the head injury that he suffered did have an impact on his neurocognitive functioning and has contributed to some degree to his capacity for employment and has likely also contributed to increasing his vulnerability to loss of emotional control however in the absence of formal neuropsychological testing I am unable to say this with medical certainty.
...
He describes that his last experience of a seizure was approximately one week prior to the alleged offence; at the time of the alleged offence he went to the store and got involved in an altercation with another motorist, then engaging in behaviours that resulted in the alleged offence; in my view, it is unlikely that his seizure disorder would have played a direct role in the offending behaviour however it is possible that cognitive impairments played a role ...; my clinical suspicion is that he has probably suffered frontal lobe damage and that this would have contributed to a diminished capacity for self control and increased his vulnerability to acting in an impulsive and aggressive manner when angered.
...
At the time I saw your client he expressed that he felt bad for the victim and wished that he could apologise to the victim suggesting feelings of remorse.""
31Dr Allnutt's recommendation for further formal neuropsychological assessment was not acted upon.
32Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing Judge would regard the fact that the applicant lost control, and did so after the victim produced a piece of timber as a factor which indicated that the seriousness of the offence was somewhat less than it otherwise might be.  His counsel submitted that the attack was a spontaneous one and that it did not last for a sustained period of time.  He further submitted that the applicant's depressed mental state and capacity to more readily lose control, were matters which ought be taken into account.  He submitted that the applicant was remorseful.  
33Counsel for the applicant also submitted that in light of the plea of guilty, his client was entitled to a discount on any sentence which he would otherwise have received.  
34The applicant submitted that a discount of 20 per cent would be appropriate.  The Crown submitted that a discount of 15 per cent was appropriate.
35Counsel for the applicant also submitted that the Court ought make a finding in accordance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that there were special circumstances such as to result in a adjustment of the statutory ratio between the sentence and the non-parole period.
36In terms of the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, counsel for the applicant submitted that the matter fell below the mid-range.  
Subjective Features37The applicant was born on 15 July 1971, and was accordingly 38 years old at the time of the offence.
38He had a previous criminal history going back to 1989 which included a number of offences of assault in 1993, when he was convicted of an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two and a half years with a non-parole period of a little over one year and ten months.  
39In 1997 he was again convicted of an assault for which he was fined.  In 1999, he was convicted of a common assault for which he received a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of two years.  
40He had some other matters on his criminal record, but in the 10 years prior to his commission of this offence, he had only one offence of violence, which was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was fined $1,000 in the Penrith Local Court.  Judging by the fact that only a fine was imposed, I would conclude that this assault involved a relatively low level of criminality.
41Prior to the offence in question, the applicant had undertaken some work as a casual labourer in 2008 and 2009 for an asphalting company on the Central Coast.  His employer was willing to consider rehiring the applicant again, once that was possible.
Remarks on Sentence42The sentencing Judge delivered his sentence on the day upon which he received submissions.  
43He carefully noted the objective features of the offence, the extent of injuries sustained by the victim, and briefly summarised the applicant's subjective case.  
44The sentencing Judge drew these conclusions:
(a)The offence was a serious one which involved a degree of violence used against the victim; 
(b)His Honour was satisfied that the attack was deliberate and that the applicant's action showed that he intended to wound the victim and cause serious bodily injury.  His Honour noted that the nature of the attack to the victim's face increased the seriousness of the offence.  As did the fact that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon, being a knife.  
(c)His Honour accepted the opinion of Dr Allnutt that at the time of the offence, the applicant was in an emotional state and that he was relying upon drinking alcohol and continuing to use cannabis to deal with that emotion.  
(d)His Honour expressed the view that the offence, by reason of the deliberate act of the offender, and the injury sustained to the victim, was above the mid range of objective seriousness.
45The sentencing judge did not deal with all of the opinions of Dr Allnutt.  In particular, he made no mention of his opinion derived from his clinical examination, that the applicant had probably suffered frontal lobe damage from his two previous head injuries which would have contributed to a loss of self control.
46Although Dr Allnutt described this opinion as his ""clinical suspicion"", the sentencing Judge made no reference to it.  
47His Honour found that the applicant was entitled to a discount of ""somewhere between 15 and 20 [per cent]"".  
48His Honour then pronounced sentence.  
Proceedings after initial sentence49Having considered his Honour's oral remarks, after the luncheon adjournment, the Crown Prosecutor returned with counsel for the applicant, to the Court to draw his Honour's attention to what had occurred.  
50His Honour in imposing sentence, had said that he was of the opinion that but for the plea of guilty, the appropriate sentence would be a period of imprisonment of 10 years.  The sentence, which his Honour actually imposed, was a total of nine years.  Given the apparent discrepancy between the amount to be allowed by way of discount that is, between 15 and 20 per cent and the sentence which his Honour actually imposed, it was appropriate for counsel to draw the matter to his Honour's attention.  
51The Crown Prosecutor indicated to the sentencing Judge, that as the sentence then stood, the applicant had received a discount of 10 per cent rather than that which his Honour had announced.  A discount of only 10 per cent was less than both the Crown and the applicant had submitted.
52There was then some discussion about the mathematical consequences of various calculations.  This discussion ended with this statement:
""His Honour: ...so if I make it 8 years and 3 months, that's somewhere between 15 and 20 [per cent] isn't it?
Crown Prosecutor: That's right, that's correct. 
[Applicant's counsel]: That's so.
...
His Honour: So it would mean, just work out the calculations in relation to this, I think that would still be right.  So the minimum if it was 8 years and 3 months, the minimum non-parole period would be somewhere in the vicinity of 6 years and 9 months, is that not so?  Because it has to be a third of that.  So the minimum period of 6 years is still giving him a position of less than the minimum statutory period.
[Applicant's Counsel]: Yes, it's still within the ratio.
His Honour:  And that is correct?
[Applicant's Counsel]: Yes.
Crown Prosecutor: That's right.""
53His Honour then went on to make this remark with respect to the minimum period:
""His Honour: And in fixing that minimum period, it should be noted on the record that I have found special circumstances in particular in relation to the continuing support that he is receiving from his partner and family and the continuing assistance that will occur to him in relation to any possible rehabilitation.  And that would still bring in the special circumstances in relation to the six years.  So the only thing that would have to be changed, other than the fact that I have found special circumstances which should have been noted, would be the period of imprisonment taking into account his plea of guilty of 8 years and 3 months, is that not so?
[Applicant's Counsel]: That is so your Honour, but I think I may have been wrong when I said a minute ago that 6 years would fulfil the statutory ratio.  I think the normal test is the non-parole period needs to be 75 per cent in proportion to the head sentence.
...
[Applicant's Counsel]: Actually no, your Honour, I think your Honour's right, I think it was 72 per cent and that would be, that would make sense.  
His Honour:  Yes.
Crown Prosecutor: That's under 75.""
54His Honour then proceeded to re-sentence the applicant, saying this:
""I sentence you, you are convicted of the offence and taking into account your plea of guilty, I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of 8 years and 3 months, which is to date from 28 January 2010 and is to expire on 27 April 2018.  I find special circumstances and I set a non-parole period of 6 years which is to date from 28 January 2010 and is to expire on 27 January 2016 on which date you will be eligible for release on parole subject to the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and to obey all directions of that service particularly in relation to drug and alcohol counselling, and to remain on parole until the expiration of your sentence on 27 April 2018.""
Grounds of Appeal55The applicant relies upon seven grounds of appeal.  They are as follows:
(1)His Honour failed to take into account a material consideration namely the applicant's mental disorder in the sentencing exercise.
(2)His Honour took into account an irrelevant matter when finding the offence was above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
(3)His Honour erred in finding that the offence was above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
(4)His Honour erred in his approach to the non-parole period in that the finding of special circumstances was not adequately reflected in the non-parole period imposed.
(5)His Honour failed to comply with s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the fashion in which he sentenced the applicant.
(6)His Honour failed to reflect the discount for the plea of guilty in the non-parole period.  
(7)The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.  
Ground 1 - Applicant's mental condition56The applicant submits that the sentencing Judge failed to properly consider, and take into account, the applicant's mental state.  In particular, the applicant submits that the sentencing Judge ought to have concluded that the applicant had probably suffered frontal lobe damage, which was a causally contributive factor to the way in which he acted.
57It is undoubted that mental illness, or a mental problem may be relevant in a number of ways in the sentencing process.  As this Court held in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36], the ways in which mental illness or disorder may be relevant are:
(1)where mental illness contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced;
(2)mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration;
(3)a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person;
(4)it may reduce or eliminate the need for specific deterrence;
(5)a countervailing consideration may arise, namely that the level of danger which the offender presents to the community may sound in special deterrence.
See also Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1 at [177]-[178]. 
58It is necessary to note that the application of these principles is not limited to cases of serious psychiatric illness.  Circumstances may indicate that a condition or problem of modest severity may still be relevant: De La Rosa at [178]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102; 16 VR 269 at [15].
59The sentencing Judge gave only very brief consideration to this issue.  He said this, in addition to the references to the existence of Dr Allnutt's report:
""I do however, accept that he did state to Dr Allnutt that he was remorseful for his conduct and I also accept that, as at the time of the offence, he was suffering from effects of depression.  His conduct in drinking daily and imbibing drugs, which he said he was imbibing, is no excuse for his actions and are only taken into account in relation to the background of the offence.  The only real mitigating factor available to the offender, is that of his plea of guilty.""
60It does appear from this extract that the sentencing Judge rejected the applicant's mental state as in any way contributing to the commission of the offence, including the applicant's moral culpability, and did not consider that the need for either general or special deterrence may have been reduced or eliminated.  His conclusion of substance was that the applicant's history of previous head injuries, his history of convulsions and his tendency to react violently, particularly having regard to his medication were not matters to be taken into account by way of mitigation.
61The material before the sentencing Judge indicated that the applicant had, in the past, sustained two head injuries, which had led to neurological complications.  The report of Dr Fung of 18 February 2003, to which Dr Allnutt made reference, also noted that one of the complications which the applicant faced was that whilst taking medication for his neurological condition, manifesting in seizures, the applicant suffered side effects which worsened his mood, and meant that he had poor temper control. The medication also gave him headaches.
62This was a good reason for the applicant to cease to take that medication.  As is apparent, having ceased taking his medication, the applicant's capacity to control his temper and behaviour was then unremediated by the beneficial effect of any medication.  
63This evidence and material warranted careful consideration, and, so it seems to me, required some mitigation of the sentence to be imposed by his Honour.  His Honour did not have any, or any expressed, regard to this material.  
64Because it was highly relevant, I would uphold the appeal on this Ground because the sentencing Judge disregarded it, and did not as he should have, take it into account.
Ground 2 - Irrelevant material considered65The applicant submits that his Honour took into account an irrelevant matter when finding the offence was above the mid-range of seriousness.
66The submission for the applicant notes that the offence for which the applicant was sentenced, was one against s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, namely that the applicant wounded Mr Staunch with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  
67In assessing what the objective seriousness of the offence was, the sentencing Judge concluded that the offence fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness.  This was a significant finding in the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  
68In approaching that finding, his Honour said:
""I consider on the agreed facts before the Court, the attack was deliberate and the actions of the offender showed that he intended to cause or to wound the victim and cause serious bodily injury.""
69When announcing his finding that the applicant's conduct fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness, his Honour said:
""I have come to the conclusion that the offence by nature of the deliberate act of the offender and the injuries sustained to the victim, is above the mid-range of objective seriousness.""
70When determining where on the range of objective seriousness an offence falls, the determination is made by a sentencing Judge by reference to the particular offence, and the factual circumstances which demonstrate the guilt of the person to be sentenced.  
71In other words, one is not comparing an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, which is an offence of specific intent, with some different offence which does not have, as a necessary element, a specific intent.  On the contrary, one is comparing the factual circumstances which go to make up the particular offence, and asking the question, where, on the full range of factual circumstances which can comprise the offence, does this particular set of factual circumstances fall.  
72It is unclear from his Honour's remarks that this is the approach he adopted.  Allowing for the fact that his Honour was delivering his sentence in an ex tempore fashion, I am nevertheless satisfied that his Honour seems to have placed significant weight on the fact that the act was deliberate and intentional on the part of the applicant.  He has wrongly used these features to determine where on the range of objective seriousness, this conduct falls.  
73This was an erroneous approach.  
74This Ground of appeal should be upheld.
Ground 3 - Error in finding offence above mid-range of objective seriousness75The applicant submits that there was an error, not just in the path by which the sentencing Judge reached his conclusion, but also for the sentencing Judge to have concluded that the offence was above the mid-range of objective seriousness.  
76In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J agreed, said:
""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.  This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge, exercising a broadly based discretion.  The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.""
77Simpson J, in her reasons, said this at [46]:
""The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge.  It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of discretion.  As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.  The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated.  It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge.  That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by the reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position.  It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system.  Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""
78Nevertheless, as Basten JA has said in R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [51]-[52]:
""Nevertheless, the appellate Court retains a statutory responsibility under s 5D or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act to intervene in circumstances where, upon an application of the correct principles, error is established: R v KB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [53] ... 
The accepted principles are those identified in House v R ...  As has been noted on other occasions, the principles in House refer to appellate interference with discretionary orders; nevertheless, similar principles are to be applied in relation to evaluative judgments such as that now in issue.""
It is necessary to keep in mind these principles.  
79However, in light of the fact that I consider that error has been established with respect to Grounds 1 and 2, with the result that it will be necessary to re-sentence the applicant, it will be necessary for this Court to determine the degree of objective seriousness of this offence.
Ground 4 -Failure to correctly reflect the finding of special circumstancesGround 6 -Failure to reflect discount for the plea of guilty in the non-parole period
80It is convenient to deal with these two Grounds together.  The recounting of the exchange which took place after the luncheon adjournment, and which is set out in [52]-[54] above, demonstrates that the initial sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge failed to reflect the discount which his Honour had in mind.  
81His Honour commenced with what he thought would be an appropriate total sentence.  He announced that he was discounting it, but failed to discount it sufficiently to reflect his stated intention.  He had discounted it by 10 per cent from 10 years to 9 years.  He intended to discount the sentence by an amount between 15 and 20 per cent.  When this was drawn to his Honour's attention, he reduced the overall sentence to 8 years and 3 months.  This represented a discount of 17.5 per cent, which accorded with his stated intention.  
82Although he increased the discount for the plea of guilty on the total sentence from 10 per cent to 17.5 per cent, his Honour made no change at all to the non-parole period.  Ordinarily, one would expect that his Honour having fixed the non-parole component at 6 years with a balance of term of three years, namely, a ratio of 50 per cent, that the same ratio would continue to apply after he had adjusted the balance of the term.  
83However, without reasons being given, his Honour did not adjust the non-parole period, which meant that the balance of the term represented just 37.5 per cent of the applicant's non-parole period, and not 50 per cent as his Honour had initially imposed.  
84In the course of sentencing, his Honour made a specific finding of special circumstances.  He said that he found special circumstances by reason of the continuing support and assistance the applicant was receiving from his partner and family, and his finding that that support and assistance would continue in a way which assisted with his rehabilitation.  This finding of special circumstances, and the reasons for it, provided a sufficient basis for increasing the statutory ratio from 33 per cent to 50 per cent.  The finding certainly provided a proper basis for a greater increase of the statutory 33 per cent ratio than the 37.5 per cent, which is the position that his Honour finally reached.
85It is clear that his Honour failed to reflect adequately the discount for the plea of guilty in the non-parole period which he ultimately imposed, and in so doing, did not adequately allow for the finding of special circumstances in the non-parole period which he fixed.
86I would uphold the appeal on these Grounds.
Ground 5 - Failure to comply with s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 87This Ground complains that his Honour failed to comply with s 44(1) in the fashion in which he sentenced the applicant.
88There is no doubt that the process by which the applicant was sentenced was sufficient to generate considerable confusion.  
89His Honour having made a calculation error in the first place, then proceeded to re-sentence the applicant, but in so doing also attempted to remedy his failure to specifically refer to special circumstances when he had earlier sentenced the applicant.
90The result of the way in which the applicant was sentenced, undoubtedly created room for confusion.  
91Section 44 requires that when sentencing an offender, the Court is first to set a non-parole period for the sentence. Although it is necessary to also determine a balance of term, such an exercise is not a two-step or sequential process: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [112]. However, there are separate considerations which involve s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The sentencing judge in this case did not adequately conduct this aspect of the sentencing.  
92However, in light of the fact that error has been established upon other grounds, which require this Court to undertake the determination of an appropriate sentence, there is no need to come to a final conclusion on this ground.
Ground 7 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive93As with Grounds 3 and 5, because of the fact that error has been established in the imposition of sentence, which will require this Court to re-sentence the applicant, there is no utility in considering this Ground any further.  
Re-sentence94The applicant relied upon an affidavit affirmed on 18 April 2012, in the event that this Court came to re-sentence him.  The Crown did not challenge the contents of this affidavit.  It did not submit that the Court should not have regard fully to them, if the applicant came to be re-sentenced.  
95The Court is entitled to take into account the applicant's current circumstances in the exercise of re-sentencing.  
96The affidavit discloses that the applicant has been, and is continuing to be, held on protection whilst in custody.  This has been necessitated by the fact that his safety was threatened because a relation of his was in jail for a crime not approved of by his jail inmates.  It is likely that he will spend the balance of his time in custody on protection.
97The applicant notes that he has been well behaved since being in jail and has only taken prescription medication.  He says that no illegal or illicit drugs have been taken.  Random tests by the prison authorities have not detected any illicit drug use.
98The applicant has completed a number of courses and has carried out work when available.  He notes the existence of ongoing family support, and the benefit that he obtains from this.  
99The applicant expresses his remorse for his crime and acknowledges the effect that his crime has had upon Mr Staunch, the victim.
100These are matters that stand to his credit in any re-sentencing process, and I will have regard to them.  
101The applicant's subjective features have been discussed earlier.
102It seems to me that significant weight must be given when determining a sentence to the impact that the applicant's head injuries have had on his behaviour, including the fact that he has poor temper control. 
103Having regard to the agreed facts in this matter, it seems obvious, and I would conclude, that poor temper control played a significant role in the events that occurred.
104The offence was undoubtedly a serious one.  
105The maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 7 years, are both important guideposts to be taken into account when imposing a sentence.  The standard non-parole period has limited weight in the present circumstances, because of the discount for the plea of guilty, the effect of the earlier head injuries on the applicant's culpability and the need to reflect the finding of special circumstances in the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence.
106The sentencing Judge was satisfied that special circumstances existed for the reasons that he expressed.  The Crown did not submit that there was any error in this finding, or that special circumstances did not exist.  I am satisfied that special circumstances exist which means that the applicant should have a longer period on parole than that provided for by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
107It will also be necessary to give effect to the applicant's plea of guilty for which a discount should be given.  The sentencing Judge ultimately allowed a discount of 17.5 per cent.  No one submitted that this finding was erroneous.  I would allow the same discount. 
108Taking into account all of the matters relevant on the issue of sentencing, and the need to balance the objectives of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I would propose that the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years, with a balance of term of 2 years.
109I propose the following orders:
(a)Leave to appeal granted.
(b)Appeal allowed.
(c)Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales on 25 November 2010.
(d)Sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 28 January 2010 and expiring on 27 January 2014.
(e)Sentence the applicant to a balance of term of 2 years, expiring on 27 January 2016.
(f)Note the first day upon which the applicant is eligible for release on parole is 27 January 2014.

2708092,R v Agius; R v Abibadra; R v Jandagi; R v Zerafa [2012] NSWSC 639,"Judgment - cROWN CASE IN REPLY

1On the sixtieth (and what would, subject to the following, have been the last) day of evidence in this trial, the Crown sought leave to adduce evidence in reply. Two aspects of the evidence given in the defence cases prompted the application. The first concerned evidence given by Ms Abibadra concerning her whereabouts on a date and at a time at which the prosecution evidence asserted that she was present at a particular meeting. Counsel for Ms Carol Abibadra accepted that the evidence was admissible and that he could raise no realistic objection to its admission. That evidence has been given and there is no need to explore it further. 

2The remaining evidence proposed to be called in reply concerns evidence given by Ms Deborah Jandagi. A little background needs to be set out.

3Each of the four accused is charged with two counts of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. The charges arise out of what is asserted by the Crown to be (and, to a large extent, is accepted as being) a fraudulent tax ""minimisation"" scheme in which more than eight Australian companies participated. The Crown case is that Mr Robert Agius was a promoter of the scheme, and the three remaining accused were accountants who facilitated that participation. A fifth person, Mr Owen T Daniel, now deceased, is also named in the indictment as a conspirator. In the case of Mr Kevin Zerafa, Ms Abibadra and Ms Jandagi, it has been made clear that the principal issue for the jury will be whether the Crown has proved that they acted dishonestly. Relevant to that question is the extent of their knowledge of the manner in which the scheme operated.

4The principles on which an application by the Crown to adduce evidence in reply in a criminal trial ought to be determined were stated by the High Court in Shaw v The Queen [1952] HCA 18; 84 CLR 265, and restated in R v Frank Christopher Lawrence, unreported, NSWCCA, 12 October 1980. Essentially, the determination is discretionary, but the discretion is to be exercised in favour of the Crown only in rare and unusual circumstances. One of the circumstances that permits the exercise of the discretion is the production of evidence, not reasonably to be anticipated by the Crown, during the course of a defence case. Relevant considerations include the potential impact of the evidence, coming, as it inevitably does, at the end of the defence case (or cases), and as the last piece of evidence the jury will hear before addresses.

5I now turn to the circumstances in which the Crown seeks to adduce the evidence. 

6Evidence was given in the Crown case by Mrs Eva Southcombe and Mr Philip Southcombe. They were the directors and shareholders of Gladesville Bridge Marina Pty Limited (""GBM""), a company which had participated in the tax ""minimisation"" scheme the subject of the proceedings. Mrs Southcombe gave evidence that, during 2004, she suffered a severe psychiatric breakdown, as a result of which she was hospitalised. The clear implication of her evidence was that this arose as a result of her participation in the scheme. She gave evidence that Ms Jandagi visited her in the hospital, during which visit Mrs Southcombe expressed to Ms Jandagi her concern about her involvement in the scheme. Of Ms Jandagi's response to this, she said:

""Ultimately she said she'd fix it, I'd have no further involvement with the scheme and I wouldn't have to worry about it.""

She said that that did not eventuate.

7Mr Southcombe gave in evidence his account of how this visit came about. He said that he telephoned Ms Jandagi and asked if she would visit Mrs Southcombe and ""console her with the news that they were going to be removed from the scheme"". He said that he told Ms Jandagi that Mrs Southcombe's concern about the scheme was the cause of her hospitalisation.

8Mr Southcombe's evidence was, in cross-examination, put in dispute. It was put to him directly that he had never spoken to Ms Jandagi about visiting his wife in the hospital. He disagreed with that proposition. It was also put to him, as a possibility, that he had had conversation to the effect with Mr Owen Daniel. He did not accept that as a possibility and said that his memory was that he had spoken to Ms Jandagi.

9In one sense, in a trial in which evidence has been presented over 60 days, the evidence in question might appear to be relatively insignificant. As I understand it, the Crown will seek to rely upon the evidence of Mr Southcombe concerning what he said to Ms Jandagi - that his wife's involvement in the scheme was the cause of her psychiatric illness - and his request to her to console Mrs Southcombe by saying that the company would be extricated from the scheme, together with Mrs Southcombe's evidence that Ms Jandagi promised to achieve that, as (taken together with other evidence) indicative of a recognition by Ms Jandagi that the arrangements under which the scheme operated were, and were known by Ms Jandagi to be, fraudulent. 

10That the evidence is of more significance that might otherwise appear is demonstrated by Ms Jandagi's response to it, in her evidence. She did not dispute having visited Mrs Southcombe in hospital. She gave her very different account of how that came about. That account is as follows:

""The week previous to this, I think it was the Friday, late in the week I received a phone call from a lady called Andrea Franco and she explained to me that 'I've taken over from Eva at Gladesville Bridge doing all the book work there'. I thought at the time, oh, that's strange. But she said 'because Eva's not well and she's in hospital'. I said, 'Oh my gosh, what's happened?' And she said, 'Well, she's had a nervous breakdown and I'll be taking over from her'; I said, 'OK, thanks for letting me know.'

I immediately told my father [Owen Daniel] because he was good friends with them and he was going to Queensland that night. He said to me, 'I will definitely ring Philip but in the meantime could you arrange to take some flowers to Eva next week?' and I said, 'Yes, that's fine, I'll do that'. I called Andrea Franco back and I said I wanted to visit her if that's all right with her. She said, 'I'm sure that will be fine"", and she gave me the address of the hospital and I put it in on the Wednesday because ... I thought that would be a good day to go down and visit her. That's what I did."" (T3689)

Ms Jandagi said that she had never spoken to Mr Southcombe about the matter.

11This evidence was given by Ms Jandagi during the morning of Monday 4 June.

12She then gave an account of the hospital visit. She maintained that she and Mrs Southcombe had chatted about a variety of ""light"" subjects, but had not mentioned business at all. She expressly denied telling Mrs Southcombe that she would ""fix it"".

13Although the name ""Andrea Franco"" had previously been mentioned, in passing, by Mrs Southcombe, it was not mentioned in connection with Ms Jandagi's visit to Mrs Southcombe in hospital. And although Mr Southcombe's evidence of his conversation with Ms Jandagi was directly put in issue in his cross-examination, there was no hint in that cross-examination that Ms Jandagi would assert that the visit had been precipitated by a conversation with Ms Franco, or that Ms Jandagi's awareness of Mrs Southcombe's illness had come to her through such a conversation. The Crown therefore had no notice of the nature of the content of the evidence given in this respect by Ms Jandagi.

14The evidence the Crown now seeks to adduce in reply is contained in a statement made by Ms Franco on 6 June 2012. Ms Franco says that, since 2000, she has been engaged as a part time bookkeeper to various business entities associated with Mr and Mrs Southcombe. She says that she has not been involved in bookkeeping for GBM. 

15She denies the conversations attributed to her by Ms Jandagi and says that, as a matter of confidentiality, she would not have made any disclosure about Mrs Southcombe's medical condition. She says that, indeed, she did not have any real information about the nature of Mrs Southcombe's condition, and did not know the name of the medical facility in which Mrs Southcombe was hospitalised.

16I should mention here that, while the evidence clearly has the capacity to affect the jury's assessment of Ms Jandagi's credibility, it is not tendered, and would not be admissible - (Evidence Act 1995, s 102) for that purpose. It is evidence on which the Crown seeks to rely to contribute to establishing that Ms Jandagi's state of mind was dishonest, and that she was aware of the allegedly fraudulent nature of the arrangements under which the scheme operated.

17Counsel for Ms Jandagi initially argued that the evidence fails to meet the tests propounded in Shaw and Lawrence. Eventually, he retreated somewhat from that position, accepting that the Crown could not reasonably be expected to have anticipated the evidence given by Ms Jandagi concerning Ms Franco. Since that acceptance fell short of a concession, it is necessary that I state explicitly that I am satisfied that the evidence is admissible on received principles. It is evidence that the Crown could not reasonably have anticipated and met in advance.

18Counsel, however, strenuously urged (correctly) that the admission of the evidence is discretionary and, further, that the discretion ought not be exercised in favour of the Crown. Circumstances relevant to the exercise of discretion include the relative importance of the evidence (with which I have already dealt), the scope of the evidence proposed (see the facts in Shaw), and the potential of the evidence to have a disproportionate impact due to its timing - as the last piece of evidence the jury will hear. This last is, in my opinion, the most powerful argument in favour of rejection of the evidence. However, it must be seen in the context of the circumstances of the trial. As I have mentioned, the oral evidence has been given over 60 days. There is an enormous amount of documentary evidence to which the jury have repeatedly been directed and to which they will again be directed, in the course of five addresses and a summing up.

19The issue arose on Thursday 7 June, the last day of sitting before a long weekend, it having already been determined (by reason of a prior commitment of one member of the jury) that the court would not sit on the Friday of that week.

20Regrettably, the witness, Ms Franco, was not available to give evidence on the Thursday, and so, if the evidence is permitted, will be called after a four day break. At that time, the Crown case in reply will close.

21It has been agreed that, at the conclusion of the evidence, the jury will be released for the remainder of the week. That is to allow for the finalisation of legal issues concerning directions to be given to the jury, and to allow counsel an opportunity to prepare what will inevitably be lengthy and detailed addresses. In my opinion, that combination of circumstances very significantly minimises what might otherwise be the potential, and the potentially undue, impact of the evidence. The prominence it might otherwise assume will, inevitably, be dissipated. In these circumstances, I have concluded that the evidence ought to be admitted.

22Mr Barker QC, appearing for Mr Agius, who was not initially involved in the argument, sought to be heard with respect to consequential determinations in the event that I made the ruling that I have just indicated that I will make. He sought that, if such an order were to be made, it ought to be conditional upon the Crown recalling both Mr and Mrs Southcombe for further cross-examination.

23There is no basis upon which such a condition ought to be imposed. Ms Franco's evidence is to be admitted for the very limited purpose of enabling the Crown to rebut one specific assertion in the evidence of Ms Jandagi. Both Mr and Mrs Southcombe have been cross-examined on the matters relevant to Ms Franco's evidence. Nothing additional that can be put to them on that topic, at least nothing that could not have been put when they gave their evidence initially, has been identified. To recall them would merely permit the reopening of matters that have been, or were available to be, put to them then. To allow the course suggested by Mr Barker would potentially and impermissibly reopen areas of evidence that are closed, with consequent potential damage to the cases of the other accused. Even if I were to allow that course at the express request of one accused, I must bear in mind the potential unfairness to the other accused. Accordingly, I decline to impose such a condition.

24The order I make is that the Crown will be permitted to call Ms Franco in reply in order to give evidence in accordance with her statement dated 6 June 2012 (Voir dire exhibit 3).

		06 August 2013",2012-06-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708094,R v Chaplin [2012] NSWDC 301,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Christian Richard Chaplin was working for a company involved in industrial water treatment. He regularly worked from home. He was given a company laptop computer in order to assist him. Unbeknownst to his employer, he used that computer to access child pornography. He backed up the images and videos that he viewed onto CDs. When he resigned from the company he returned the laptop and accidentally returned some of the CDs. That was on 15 April 2011.

2One of the owners of the company looked at the laptop and the CDs that Mr Chaplin had returned. He saw child pornography on one of the CDs. Shocked as he was, he apparently was not terribly clear what he should do. The directors of the company discussed the material. The offender was contacted and he said that the material had been given to him by a friend. Eventually, the owners of the company reported the matter to police. They then went to the offender's premises and searched them. They found a number of further CDs containing child pornography. The offender also told them that there was a hard drive containing child pornographic images on it, but when that was later examined it was shown that that was not the case.

3The offender now stands to be sentenced for two offences of possessing child abuse material. One of those charges relates to the material handed in to his former employer on 15 April and the other relates to the material found on the CDs by police when they searched his home on 21 July.

4Consistent with what I understand to be good practice, the prosecution has not perpetuated the harm that has been caused to the children involved in the production of this child abuse material by further publishing that material, in particular by tendering the images to me. However, what is conceded to be an accurate summary of a large number of CDs was tendered to me. There were 25 discs examined and in excess of 80,000 child abuse images and videos were discovered.

5A sample of each disc was viewed and categorised, according to the Child Exploitation Tracking Scheme Scale. It is important to remember that the scale is a bit deceptive because whilst categories 1 to 5 involve increasing heinousness of images and videos, category 6 is an entirely different category involving drawings and cartoons of children. In other words, category 6 is not worse than category 5. With that in mind, it is clear that the offender possessed child abuse material covering all categories, including images and videos that indicated sadism or bestiality, and which included sexual imagery involving pain, humiliation or animals. There were other images and videos showing penetrative sexual activity involving children including intercourse, cunnilingus and fellatio.

6In contrast to some of the other cases that have come before the courts, the children depicted appear to be to be no younger than six, but they were certainly under the age of 16 and in the age group of six to 13 years, according to the facts tendered to me.

7The seriousness of such conduct is obvious. The courts have set out repeatedly why it is that offences of this kind cause such harm. Primarily of course, and most directly, there is the harm involved in the children who are depicted in the videos and images. In order for someone to photograph or video a child being sexually abused, a child has to be sexually abused. How it is that the offender could view this material and not have feelings of empathy towards the innocent children involved is difficult to understand. 

8But the harm involved in offences of this type, goes beyond that caused to those children directly involved in the production of material. There is, as was reported in this case, a process of desensitisation and it is not drawing a long bow at all to suggest that possession and production of child abuse material leads, in a more indirect way, to children being sexually abused, either by the person who has viewed the material or in other ways, as the abuse of children becomes more commonplace.

9The offender had a background which provides no clues as to why he would offend in this way. He was raised in Wales, came to Australia with his mother at a relatively young age and has been successful in his life. He has been an industrious worker and is regarded as an upstanding member of the community. He has been married for ten years and has three children to his wife. He has told many people who know him about what he has done. Despite that, it appears that his friends and family have stood by him. References attesting to his good character were tendered today and almost invariably they referred to the circumstance that the offender retained their support, despite the referees knowing the details of what he had done.

10The offender co-operated with the police when his premises were searched and that co-operation continued. He pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence. He was arraigned on an indictment today because of a defect in the committal document, but his early plea of guilty is to be rewarded with a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea.

11His co-operation with the police and his early pleas of guilty are also consistent with the offender expressing remorse. I accept that he is remorseful and I accept that he has difficulty, himself, understanding how it is that he came to view this enormous number of videos and images.

12It is suggested that the offender became exposed to pornography when he was working at a service station which sold pornographic material. One thing the internet has clearly done is allowed people with an interest in pornography to access such material. It has also allowed those who wish to view child abuse material to access that as well.

13There is little to explain why it would be that the offender's interests would change from viewing adult pornography, such as he saw in the service station, to child pornography such that he accessed over the internet. There is no suggestion that he has acted out on and sexually assaulted any children in any way and yet his actions, in viewing this material, he says perhaps out of boredom, are concerning in the extreme.

14I repeat, it is difficult to understand how anyone could get any form of pleasure, even overcome his boredom, through viewing material which clearly harmed the children involved in its production.

15The maximum penalty for each of these offences is ten years. It is well known that followed an increase in penalties some years ago. That increase reflects the attitude of the legislature to offences of this kind and it is important that courts give effect to the expression of Parliament's intention.

16It is clear that the offender must go to gaol. He gave evidence that he had prepared his children for this by telling them that he was going to working in Western Australia and would not be home for some time. Nothing less than a full-time custodial sentence is appropriate to reflect the objective gravity of what the offender did.

17The offender is unlikely to re-offend, at least in part because of the sentence I will soon be imposing. He thus has good prospects for rehabilitation and is working at present with psychologists who are seeking to assist him.

18I want to refer to something that appeared in the letter to the court from the offender's wife. She accurately suggested that their children would be harmed by the offender being sent to gaol. It is, unfortunately a commonplace occurrence, that parents of children go to gaol and thereby the suffer. I acknowledge that impact upon the children of the offender and his wife. But of course, that letter did not take account of the wider need to protect other children, other innocent children, including those involved in the production of the offending material. It is important that they are protected. They are as innocent as the children of the offender.

19The crown suggested that I should partially accumulate. I am not going to do that for this reason. The number of charges faced by a person to be sentenced for possessing child pornography is almost an accident of the way the material is stored. These discs all came from the one source and the two charges simply relate to the time at which the offender was found to be in possession of that material. In my view, the one concurrent sentence will adequately cover the criminality of what the offender did. There are clearly special circumstances in this case, a matter conceded by the crown.

20On each count the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 18 months and a head sentence of three years. That sentence is to date from today, 13 June 2012. The non-parole period will expire on 12 December 2013, on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

2708111,Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The second to fourth respondents are parties in criminal proceedings in the District Court. On 26 March 2012 Bennett DCJ made an order pursuant to the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (the Suppression Orders Act) purporting to prevent the publication of material referring to any other criminal proceedings in which the respondents were parties or witnesses.

The applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 14 of the Suppression Orders Act. An issue arose as to whether the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and the Chief Justice constituted the same bench as a Court of Criminal Appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 3.

The issues for determination on appeal were:

(i) whether an appeal pursuant to s 14 of the Suppression Orders Act lies to the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal,

(ii) what evidence could be admitted for the purposes of an appeal pursuant to s 14 of the Suppression Orders Act,

(iii) whether the order of Bennett DCJ was a valid exercise of the power provided by the Suppression Orders Act, and

(iv) whether, to the extent that the Suppression Orders Act permitted an order in the form made by Bennett DCJ, it was inconsistent with Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), Sch 5, and therefore inoperative, pursuant to s 109 of the Constitution (Cth).

A notice pursuant to the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 78B was filed and served. The Attorney General of New South Wales appeared.

The Court held, allowing the appeal:

In relation to (i)

(per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing)

1. The impugned orders were interlocutory orders made in the District Court in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction. Accordingly, an appeal pursuant to s 14(2) would lie to the Court of Criminal Appeal as the Court from which an appeal would lie against a final judgment of the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction: [17]

2. The word ""review"", appearing in the Suppression Orders Act, s 14(6), should be construed as referring to an alternative to a statutory appeal and not to the exercise by the Supreme Court of its supervisory jurisdiction: [20]

In relation to (ii)

(per Bathurst CJ, Whealy JA agreeing)

3. The nature of an appeal depends on the construction of the particular statutory provisions by which the right of appeal is conferred. The hearing on the appeal is a hearing de novo: [6]

Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; 203 CLR 194; Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 13; 234 CLR 124 referred to.

(per Basten JA, Whealy JA agreeing)

4. The possibility that an appeal in relation to an interlocutory order involving suppression of publication of information, where the appeal may need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency, should automatically invoke a jurisdiction requiring this Court to deal with the matter de novo is unattractive. The situation may be different in other courts: [23]

(per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing)

5. There is no suggestion that leave to appeal cannot be granted conditionally, or that the Court cannot, by conditioning the grant of leave, control its own procedure: [23]

In relation to (iii)

(per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing)

6. The Suppression Orders Act permits an order prohibiting or restricting publication of information not merely tending to reveal the identity of a party or witness, but also information ""otherwise concerning"" any party or witness or person associated with a party or witness: [36]

7. It is desirable to distinguish between constraints on publication of material disclosed in court proceedings and publication of material having no connection with court proceedings except its capacity to affect current or future proceedings: [51]

John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers and managers appointed) v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344; R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; 64 NSWLR 335; Batistatos v Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW [2006] HCA 27; 226 CLR 256; Owners of Ship 'Shin Kobe Maru' v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54; 181 CLR 404 referred to.

8. An order designed to protect the proper administration of justice, without impinging upon the principle of open justice, may well be considered necessary as long as it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieve its perceived purpose: [51]

Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2010] HCA 21; 240 CLR 651; Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; 233 CLR 307 referred to.

(per Bathurst CJ, Whealy JA agreeing)

9. Although it is not sufficient that the orders are merely reasonable or sensible, the word ""necessary"" should not be given a narrow construction: [8]

R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; 64 NSWLR 335; John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers and managers appointed) v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 applied.

(per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing)

10. An order preventing public access to existing material, including a publication on a website, clearly falls within the scope of Suppression Orders Act, s 7: [61]

11. It would be a remarkable consequence of the language employed in Suppression Orders Act, s 7, if it conferred a power on a trial judge to make peremptory orders requiring private individuals or other entities unconnected with the administration of justice to take steps to remove material from potential access by a juror. It is not clear that s 7(a) expands the powers of a superior court under the general law to prevent sub judice contempt: [63]

12. A suppression order may be made in relation to material available on the internet. However, no offence is committed under Suppression Orders Act, s 16, unless the person has had the order brought to their attention: [66]-[70]

Digital News Media Pty Ltd v Mokbel [2010] VSCA 51 referred to; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1102; R v Debs [2011] NSWSC 1248 applied.

13. An order will fail the necessity test if it is futile. As a matter of construction, that which is ineffective cannot be described as ""necessary"": [76]-[78]

In relation to (iv)

(per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing)

14. An ""internet content host"" may include any party in control of a web site to which material has been uploaded. Whether it is uploaded by an agent of the party controlling the web site, or even that party itself, the party remains a content host: [90]

Trumpet Software Pty Ltd v OzEmail Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 560; 34 IPR 481; .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 424; 207 ALR 521; Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd [2011] FCAFC 23; 194 FCR 285; Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd [2012] HCA 16 referred to, Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [2002] AATA 449 applied.

15. Assuming that the court was satisfied that material did have the tendency to prejudice the fairness of a forthcoming trial, an order directed to an internet content host, relating to specified material of which it had been made aware, would not contravene the constitutional limits of the Suppression Orders Act. The statute could validly support such an order. The Suppression Orders Act could not, however, validly support an order addressed to the world at large, which might well cover material on internet sites of which the hosts were unaware: [94]-[95]



			Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and subject to what I have written below, his Honour's reasons.

The nature of the appeal

2In considering this issue it is necessary to have regard to each of s 13 and s 14 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (""the Suppression Orders Act"") and the definition of ""court"" contained in that Act.

3Section 3 defines ""court"" as follows:

""(a) the Supreme Court, Land and Environment Court, Industrial Court, District Court, Local Court or Children's Court, or

(b) any other court or tribunal, or a person or body having power to act judicially, prescribed by the regulations as a court for the purposes of this Act.""

While s 13 is in the following terms:

""13 Review of orders

(1) The court that made a suppression order or non-publication order may review the order on the court's own initiative or on the application of a person who is entitled to apply for the review.

(2) Each of the following persons is entitled to apply for and to appear and be heard by the court on the review of an order under this section: 

(a) the applicant for the order,

(b) a party to the proceedings in connection with which the order was made,

(c) the Government (or an agency of the Government) of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory,

(d) a news media organisation,

(e) any other person who, in the court's opinion, has a sufficient interest in the question of whether a suppression order or non-publication order should have been made or should continue to operate.

(3) On a review, the court may confirm, vary or revoke the order and may in addition make any other order that the court may make under this Act.""

4Section 14 is set out in the judgment of Basten JA (at par [16]).

5In my opinion, s 13 and s 14 operate harmoniously. Section 13 is confined to a review by the original court which granted the order. Section 14 deals with an appeal by leave, either in respect of the order of the original court or the order of that court on a review. Section 14(6) is not dealing with a review made by the original court under s 13, but rather with a situation where there is no appeal from the court in question (other than in the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court or the appeal to this Court provided for in s 14(2)), but there is a statutory right of review to another court or tribunal. The subsection makes clear that whatever procedure is adopted the evidentiary provision in relation to new or substituted evidence will apply.

6The nature of an appeal depends on the construction of the particular statutory provisions by which the right of appeal is conferred: Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [11]; Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Limited [2008] HCA 13; (2008) 234 CLR 124 at [2]. In the present case the wide powers to admit not only additional evidence but also substituted evidence, coupled with the fact that, subject to leave, a review under s 13 and an appeal under s 14 appear to be alternatives, lead me to the conclusion that the hearing on the appeal is a hearing de-novo.

7As Basten JA has pointed out, as a practical matter, problems which could arise as a result of this construction can be controlled by the imposition of conditions on leave to appeal. Although the question of leave will depend upon each particular case, it is likely that in cases involving a reconsideration of an order on fresh or different evidence leave will commonly be refused and the applicant left to exercise his or her right of review.

The meaning of ""necessary""

8In par [46] of his judgment, Basten JA has expressed the view that the meaning of ""necessary"" depends on the context in which it is used. I agree that what is necessary in any given case will depend on that context. It will depend on the particular grounds in s 8 of the Suppression Orders Act relied upon and the factual circumstances said to give rise to the order. I agree that the variables that Basten JA refers to in par [46] are all relevant to what will be necessary in a particular context. Although it is not sufficient, in my opinion, that the orders are merely reasonable or sensible, I agree that the word ""necessary"" should not be given a narrow construction. What was said by Hodgson JA in R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; (2005) 64 NSWLR 335 at [13] adopting the remarks of Mahoney JA in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers & Managers Appointed) v Local Court (NSW) (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 are equally applicable to the legislation in question.

""However, the requirement of necessity is not to be given an unduly narrow construction. I respectfully adopt what was said by Mahoney JA in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers & Managers Appointed v. Local Court (NSW) (at 161B): 

This leads to the consideration of what is meant by 'necessary to secure the proper administration of justice' in this context. The phrase does not mean that if the relevant order is not made, the proceedings will not be able to continue. Plainly they can. If the name of an informer is not hidden under a pseudonym, the proceeding will go on: at least, the instant proceeding will. And if the name of a security officer is revealed, the administration of justice or of the country will not collapse. The basis of the implication is that if the kind of order proposed is not made, the result will be - or at least will be assumed to be - that particular consequences will flow, that those consequences are unacceptable, and that therefore the power to make orders which will prevent them is to be implied as necessary to the proper function of the court. The kinds of consequences that, in this sense, will be seen as unacceptable may be gauged by those involved in the cases in which statutory courts have been accepted as having restrictive powers. Thus, there will be hardship on the informer or the security officer or the blackmail victim; the future supply of information from such persons will end or will be impeded; and it will be more difficult to obtain from such persons the evidence necessary to bring offenders before the courts and deal with them. It is not necessary to attempt to state exhaustively the considerations relevant in this regard: it is to considerations of this kind or of an analogous kind on which the principle stated by McHugh JA is based.""

9It follows that I agree with what Basten JA has said in par [48] of his judgment. I also agree that the requirement imposed by s 6 of the Suppression Orders Act, namely that in making an order the Court is required to take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is safeguarding the public interests in open justice, should not impede the Court from making an order when it is of the opinion that one of the grounds in s 8 is made out and that its importance will vary depending on the extent that any such order would interfere with that principle.

10BASTEN JA: The applicants are eight media companies operating in Australia, six of which operate web sites. The respondents, other than the District Court, are parties in criminal proceedings presently before that Court. On 12 August 2011, the Chief Judge of the District Court (Blanch J) made a non-publication order in respect of details of a related police investigation and the prosecution of the accused for conspiracy to murder and in relation to certain earlier proceedings. On 1 September 2011 Solomon DCJ made further orders, to similar effect. 

Orders under appeal
11On 26 March 2012, Bennett DCJ made the following five orders:

""1. The Orders made by his Honour Judge Solomon on 1 September 2011 are set aside.

2. The Orders made by his Honour Justice Blanch on 12 August 2011 are set aside.

3. Until further order, within the Commonwealth of Australia, there is to be no disclosure, dissemination, or provision of access, to the public or a section of the public, by any means, including by publication in a book, newspaper, magazine or other written publication, or broadcast by radio or television, or public exhibition, or broadcast or publication by means of the Internet of any:

(a) Material containing any reference to any other criminal proceedings in which the accused Rodney Atkinson, Fadi Ibrahim, or Michael Ibrahim are or were parties or witnesses; or 
(b) Material containing any reference to any other alleged unlawful conduct in which the accused Rodney Atkinson, Fadi Ibrahim, or Michael Ibrahim are or were suspected to be complicit or of which they are or were suspected to have knowledge.

4. Orders are stayed until 4.00pm on Tuesday 27/3/2012.

5. Orders are to be sent to the Public Information Office at the Supreme Court of New South Wales for dissemination.""

12The purpose of the emphasis was unclear; it appears in the original copy of the orders signed by the judge. The intent of the first two orders is clear, although the language is inapt: the earlier orders were revoked or discharged. 

13On 28 March 2012 Bennett DCJ made further orders, relevantly in the following terms:

""1. I decline the application to set aside Order 3 of the orders made on 26/3/2012. They shall stand.

2. I order that Order 3 made on 26 March 2012 be stayed in its application to the news media organisations the subject of the two affidavits sworn by Phillip Beattie on 27 March 2012, namely, News Digital Media Pty Ltd, Nationwide News Pty Ltd, and Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd., and the news media organisations associated with those companies as represented in those affidavits, until 4pm on Tuesday 3/4/2012. I will entertain an application at that time for further extension of the stay, should it be required.

3. Transcript of the proceedings to date, my ex tempore judgment of 26/3/2012, and of these remarks to be made available to the legal representatives for the media interests. The material should not be further disseminated for any purpose.

4. The Public Information office to bring these orders and the orders made on 26/3/2012 to the notice of internet servers Google Incorporated by facsimile ..., Google Australia Pty Ltd ... and Bing.""

14On 2 April 2012 the stay in relation to the applicants was extended by Whealy JA, upon the first four applicants undertaking to remove certain identified material from web sites controlled by them. Since 28 March there has been no stay in place except, ironically, in relation to the applicants, who have complied with the orders. 

Jurisdiction of Court
15The applicants originally commenced proceedings in the Court of Appeal, purportedly invoking the appellate jurisdiction of that Court under s 14 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (""the Suppression Orders Act""). Against the possibility that that Court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal, the Chief Justice constituted the same bench as a Court of Criminal Appeal under s 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). At the hearing, senior counsel for the applicants accepted that this was the appropriate Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction and undertook to file the relevant papers to formalise the commencement of the proceedings in this Court. The concession was correctly, if belatedly, made.

16The availability of an appeal depends on the proper construction of s 14 of the Suppression Orders Act, the relevant parts of which read as follows:

""14 Appeals

(1) With leave of the appellate court, an appeal lies against:

(a) a decision of a court (the original court) to make or not to make a suppression order or non-publication order, or
(b) a decision by the original court on the review of, or a decision by the original court not to review, a suppression order or non-publication order made by the court.

(2) The appellate court for an appeal under this section is the court to which appeals lie against final judgments or orders of the original court or, if there is no such court, the Supreme Court.
...
(5) An appeal under this section is to be by way of rehearing, and fresh evidence or evidence in addition to, or in substitution for, the evidence given on the making of the decision may be given on the appeal.

(6) If judgments or orders of the original court are subject to review by another court (rather than appeal to another court), this section provides for a review of the original court's decisions instead of an appeal and in such a case references in this section to an appeal are to be read as references to a review.""

17The principal proceeding in the District Court involved prosecution of the second, third and fourth respondents on indictment. The impugned orders were interlocutory orders made in the District Court in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction. Accordingly, if an appeal lies pursuant to s 14(2), it would lie to this Court as the Court from which an appeal would lie against a final judgment of the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction: Criminal Appeal Act, s 5.

18The existence of a right to appeal (with leave) turns on the meaning and purpose of the words in parentheses in s 14(6). On one view, they are merely explanatory of the distinction between a jurisdiction to review and a jurisdiction to hear an appeal. However, as all courts other than the Supreme Court itself will be subject to the supervisory jurisdiction under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), there is no need for the Suppression Orders Act to provide for a right of review and it seems unlikely that it so intended. An alternative reading is that the words in parentheses limit the circumstances in which sub-s (6) applies, namely to the case where there is no appeal, but only a right of review. However, as sub-s (2) expressly provides for an ""appellate court"" where there is no right of appeal, that reading is also implausible. 

19There is a third possibility, namely that s 14(6) envisages a situation where there is a statutory right of ""review"" rather than an ""appeal"". That does not appear to be the case in respect of the specific courts identified in the definition of ""court"" in s 3 of the Suppression Orders Act. However, in addition to the specified courts, the definition envisages prescription of other courts, tribunals or bodies as falling within the definition and hence the scope of the Act. The term ""review"" is commonly used with respect to a right to reconsider the merits of an administrative decision: see, eg, Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 (NSW), Chapter 5, Part 3. Similar language is to be found in the Workplace Injury and Workers Compensation Act 1998 (NSW) (""the Workplace Injury Act"") at, for example, ss 287A and 291. As examples of a possible operation of s 14(6) these provisions are not entirely plausible, as it seems unlikely that the Suppression Orders Act was expected to apply to administrative decisions of the kind referred to, rather than decisions by tribunals which might be expected to conduct proceedings in public, pursuant to principles of open justice. One possible category which might fall into the latter class is an appeal against a medical assessment under the Workplace Injury Act. The procedure is described as an ""appeal"", but the appeal is described as being ""by way of review"" of the original medical assessment: s 328(2). 

20Although these examples appear remote, they could provide an explanation for s 14(6) which does not render it otiose or inconsistent with other provisions. Accordingly, it is appropriate to construe the word ""review"" as referring to an alternative to a statutory appeal and not to the exercise by the Supreme Court of its supervisory jurisdiction.

Nature of appeal
21Accepting that there is a right of appeal, with leave, to this Court, the next question concerns the nature of the proceedings in this Court. Section 14(5) appears to envisage a rehearing involving not merely a right to call fresh evidence, but evidence which is not ""fresh"" in the conventional sense of not being available at the time of the original hearing, but also other evidence ""in addition to, or in substitution for"" the evidence given when the decision was made. Where an appeal is brought from a magistrate to the District Court, it is said to be ""by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings"": Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), s 18(1). There is power for the District Court, not only to permit fresh evidence to be given by leave (s 18(2)), but also to rehear the original evidence in the circumstances identified in s 19. By contrast, s 14(5) imposes no such restrictions on the circumstances in which additional evidence or evidence in substitution for that given below is to be permitted.

22There is a potential inconsistency between the description of an appeal as being ""by way of rehearing"" and provisions which permit evidence to be taken again. As explained by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; 203 CLR 194:

""[13] If an appellate tribunal can receive further evidence and its powers are not restricted to making the decision that should have been made at first instance, the appeal is usually and conveniently described as an appeal by way of rehearing. Although further evidence may be admitted on an appeal of that kind, the appeal is usually conducted by reference to the evidence given at first instance and is to be contrasted with an appeal by way of hearing de novo. In the case of a hearing de novo, the matter is heard afresh and a decision is given on the evidence presented at that hearing.

[14] Ordinarily, if there has been no further evidence admitted and if there has been no relevant change in the law, a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was error on the part of the primary decision-maker. That is because statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, are construed on the basis that, unless there is something to indicate otherwise, the power is to be exercised for the correction of error. However, the conferral of a right of appeal by way of a hearing de novo is construed as a proceeding in which the appellate body is required to exercise its powers whether or not there was error at first instance.""

23These observations provide a helpful summary of functional distinctions between different kinds of appeal; the use of many qualifiers in the descriptions indicates that no strict categorisation of appellate procedure and powers was intended. It is also possible that a provision of a statute may operate differentially with respect to different courts or tribunals. The possibility that an appeal in relation to an interlocutory order involving suppression of publication of information, where the appeal may need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency, should automatically invoke a jurisdiction requiring this Court to deal with the matter de novo is unattractive. The situation may be different in other courts.

24The answer to the very real practical issues is to be found in the control which the Court can in all cases exercise, the appeal being permitted only by leave of the appellate court: s 14(1). There is no suggestion that leave cannot be granted conditionally, or that the Court cannot, by conditioning the grant of leave, control its own procedure.

25In the course of the hearing, the applicants sought to tender evidence which had not been called in the District Court, from an expert in a subject described as ""computer forensics"". The expert, Mr Nick Klein, prepared a report which included information as to how the internet operated, how material was uploaded on web servers, how material could be published and republished on the internet and how the major search engines operated. The purpose of the evidence was to suggest that a suppression order of the kind made by the trial judge would be ineffective to prevent individuals searching the internet obtaining ready access to the material sought to be suppressed.

26There was some brief cross-examination of Mr Klein by counsel for the accused (third and fourth respondents), which was primarily designed to extract a concession that because particular web pages had been ""cached"" they would not necessarily remain available to a searcher when the original web page had been removed.

27This evidence was tendered and accepted, subject to ultimate consideration of its relevance. In the circumstances explained below, the evidence has limited practical significance, but it was relevant in the sense envisaged by s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as it provided some assistance to the Court in understanding the operation of the web. Although practical considerations might limit the extent to which such additional information can be admitted by this Court in the exercise of its statutory jurisdiction, it falls within the terms of s 14(5) and, the report having been tendered and cross-examination completed, it should be accepted.

Issues raised on appeal
28To the extent that the applicants were entitled to review the merit of the decision made by the primary judge, they raised the following issues:

(a) there was an absence of ""necessity"" as that concept is used in s 8(1) of the Suppression Orders Act;
(b) the order was made on the assumption that juries will not adhere to their oaths, whereas the courts routinely operate on the contrary assumption;
(c) if a juror were to disobey a direction not to view material on the internet, the order would be ineffective to prevent access to information concerning the accused;
(d) the order was excessively wide and uncertain in its operation, and
(e) the order imposed an undue constraint on free speech.

29There was some ambivalence on the part of the applicants as to the inter-relationship of the first and last grounds identified above. The reference to free speech was not based on the possible operation of the implied freedom of political discourse, as authoritatively restated by the High Court in Wotton v State of Queensland [2012] HCA 2 and recently discussed in Sunol v Collier (No 2) [2012] NSWCA 44. It appears, rather, to have invoked the common law freedom of speech and expression, which it was submitted was not to be treated as a residual liberty of the individual, but rather as a fundamental human right or freedom. So understood, it founded a principle of statutory interpretation that Parliament would not entrench upon the freedom except to the extent that such an intention was expressed or was clearly to be implied. Reliance was placed upon the statements of French J (in the Federal Court) to that effect in Bropho v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2004] FCAFC 16; 135 FCR 105 at [72]. Bropho, however, involved the proscription of racial vilification contained in s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). That provision clearly trenches upon freedom of speech; the issue in Bropho was as to the extent of the constraints imposed. 

30It will be convenient to return to arguments based on the assessment of what was ""necessary"" in the circumstances after addressing the scope of the relevant provisions of the Suppression Orders Act.

31The second broad principle relied on by the applicants was that, to the extent that the Suppression Orders Act permitted an order in this form, it was inconsistent with Schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) and therefore inoperative, pursuant to s 109 of the Constitution. For the purpose of assessing this proposition, the terms of the order are irrelevant, except as an example (if they be such) of the kind of order which can be made under the Suppression Orders Act: Sunol (No 2) at [81]. Nevertheless, if the order is otherwise invalid, the Court might properly not reach the question of constitutional validity: Newcastle Wallsend Coal Co Pty Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of NSW [2006] NSWCA 129; 153 IR 386 at [40]. However, because it might be relatively easy to recast the order into a different form, it is appropriate in this case to deal with the constitutional issue. The first step in this process is also to consider the proper construction of the State statute: Sunol (No 2) at [25] (Bathurst CJ), [56] (Allsop P) and [75]-[78] (in my judgment).

Scope of permitted orders
(a) the relevant provisions
32The operative provision of the Suppression Orders Act is s 7, which provides:

""7 Power to make orders

A court may, by making a suppression order or non-publication order on grounds permitted by this Act, prohibit or restrict the publication or other disclosure of: 

(a) information tending to reveal the identity of or otherwise concerning any party to or witness in proceedings before the court or any person who is related to or otherwise associated with any party to or witness in proceedings before the court, or
(b) information that comprises evidence, or information about evidence, given in proceedings before the court.""

33Section 7 has the potential to deal with two quite separate categories of information. One is information the publication of which could give rise to a charge of contempt of court under the sub judice principle, that is publication of material that has a tendency to influence the conduct or outcome of particular legal proceedings. The second category is that which is revealed in the course of proceedings, non-publication of which may be necessary for one of a number of reasons, but the consequence of which will be a degree of interference with the principle that proceedings should be conducted in open court.

34It is with respect to the second category of information that the statement in s 6 of the Suppression Orders Act is apposite:

""6 Safeguarding public interest in open justice

In deciding whether to make a suppression order or non-publication order, a court must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice.""

35It is the operation of that objective which has been foremost in the discussion of non-publication orders in respect of on-going litigation, a matter which will be discussed below. Taken by itself, s 6 might suggest that the powers conferred by s 7 were not intended to apply to potentially contemptuous publication in advance of a trial. However, that conclusion would be inconsistent with the expansive statement of grounds for making an order contained in s 8:

""8 Grounds for making an order

(1) A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds: 

(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,
(b) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security,
(c) the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,
(d) the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency),
(e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.

(2) A suppression order or non-publication order must specify the ground or grounds on which the order is made.""

36The primary purpose of all the grounds set out in s 8(1) except the first is to permit a court to protect witnesses and parties in proceedings before it from disclosure of information about them to the general public. Only paragraph (a) appears to extend to the protection of the jury from inflammatory or irrelevant material while the proceedings are on foot (the 'sub judice principle'). The fact that an order may be sought on the ground identified in s 8(1)(a), namely that it is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, taken with the breadth of the language of s 7(a), permits an order prohibiting or restricting publication of information not merely tending to reveal the identity of a party or witness, but also information ""otherwise concerning"" any party or witness or person associated with a party or witness.

37Some support for that conclusion may be derived from the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Contempt by Publication - Report 100 (June 2003) which considered in some detail the law relating to sub judice contempt. A draft bill in Appendix A to the Report, entitled ""Contempt of Court by Publication Bill 2003"", contained cl 17, which proposed to confer, at least on the Supreme Court, power to make an order ""to restrain a contempt of court by publication of matter (whether within or outside the State) that has a tendency to prejudice the fairness of another proceeding in a court of the State"". (It will be necessary to return below to the test identified in s 8(1)(a) namely ""necessary to prevent prejudice"", as compared with the language of the draft bill which covered material having ""a tendency to prejudice"" a fair trial.) Reference to ""another proceeding"" arguably referred to non-disclosure of information revealed in the course of one trial which might interfere with a later trial: see, for an example, John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344, discussed below. However, it was not expressly or necessarily confined to that situation.

38The terms ""suppression order"" and ""non-publication order"" are defined in s 3 of the Suppression Orders Act, but in terms which do little to clarify their operation. The definitions are:

""3 Definitions

In this Act:
...

non-publication order means an order that prohibits or restricts the publication of information (but that does not otherwise prohibit or restrict the disclosure of information).
...

suppression order means an order that prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information (by publication or otherwise).""

(b) nature of 'publication'
39The definitions imply that there is a distinction to be drawn between publication and other forms of disclosure of information. However, the term ""publication"" as a derivative of the verb ""publish"" is indirectly defined by reference to the verb:

""publish means disseminate or provide access to the public or a section of the public by any means, including by: 

(a) publication in a book, newspaper, magazine or other written publication, or
(b) broadcast by radio or television, or
(c) public exhibition, or
(d) broadcast or publication by means of the Internet.""

40The identification of the scope of this legislative scheme is of some importance for the present case. On one view, the phrase ""disclosure of information"" was intended to have a wider meaning than ""publication of information"". However, the breadth of the definition of ""publish"" including by providing access to the public or a section thereof, and including within that reference ""publication by means of the Internet"", tends to diminish the significance of any attempt to distinguish between the respective concepts.

41The High Court has discussed the concept of publication in the context of defamation: Dow Jones & Company Inc v Gutnick [2002] HCA 56; 210 CLR 575. Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ stated at [26]:

""Harm to reputation is done when a defamatory publication is comprehended by the reader, the listener, or the observer. Until then, no harm is done by it. This being so it would be wrong to treat publication as if it were a unilateral act on the part of the publisher alone. It is not. It is a bilateral act - in which the publisher makes it available and a third party has it available for his or her comprehension.""

42In making that observation, their Honours were concerned with a publication which had been posted on the web site WSJ.com, controlled by the appellant. The judgment stated at [16]:

""The originator of a document wishing to make it available on the World Wide Web arranges for it to be placed in a storage area managed by a web server. This process is conventionally referred to as 'uploading'. A person wishing to have access to that document must issue a request to the relevant server nominating the location of the web page identified by its 'uniform resource locator (URL)'. When the server delivers the document in response to the request the process is conventionally referred to as 'downloading'.""

43A similar understanding of publication should be adopted in respect of the Suppression Orders Act. Information is published by uploading it in a particular form to a particular site or web page identified by a URL. By that means, the publisher provides access to the information to the public. It follows that publication is a continuing act in the case of a web site: access is provided to the public for so long as the material is available on the web.

44There may be various means of prohibiting or restricting access to such material. A person controlling a server may be able to restrict access to those who have registered with the operator of the server, and possibly paid a fee for access. In other circumstances (such as Facebook) the person who uploads material may be able to control access to his or her material. However, it appears to have been assumed in the present case that the only practical means of preventing access to material on web sites controlled by the applicants was to remove the material. That was readily done and, in fulfilment of an undertaking given to the Court prior to the hearing of the appeal, had been done in respect of material understood to be caught by the terms of the order made by the judge.

(c) meaning of ""necessary""
45The word ""necessary"" can have shades of meaning; it is not of ""a fixed character, peculiar to itself"" but rather ""admits of all degrees of comparison"", in the language of the United States Supreme Court in McCulloch v Maryland 17 US (4 Wheat) 316 at 414 (1819) cited by Gummow and Crennan JJ in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; 233 CLR 307 at [101]. The Court in McCulloch, in the same passage, noted at 413:

""If reference be had to its use, in the common affairs of the world, or in approved authors, we find that it frequently imports no more than that one thing is convenient, or useful, or essential to another.""

46The meaning of ""necessary"" depends on the context in which it is used. In s 8(1), it is used in relation to an order of the court, or, in practical terms, a proposed order, because it identifies a standard as to which the court must be satisfied before making an order. In each paragraph of that provision, the word ""necessary"" is used to describe the connection between the proposed order and an identified purpose. It may not take the same place on the variable scale of meaning in each case. In paragraph (a), the purpose of the order will be ""to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice"". That language will, in its turn, have a colour which will depend upon the circumstances. The prejudice may be a possibility or a certainty; its effect, if it eventuates, may be minor or it may cause a trial to miscarry. Similarly, prevention will involve matters of degree: the proposed order may diminish a risk of prejudice or it may obviate the risk entirely. All of these variables may affect what is considered ""necessary"" in particular circumstances.

47The language of s 8(1)(a) is also to be found in s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Although that legislation was not qualified by a provision expressly identifying the importance of the public interest in open justice (as found in s 6 of the Suppression Orders Act) a similar approach has been adopted in the Federal Court: Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish (1980) 43 FLR 129 at 133-134 (Bowen CJ) and 155-156 (Deane J). Bowen CJ identified the public interest in the administration of justice as ""the public interest that the court should endeavour to achieve effectively the object for which it was appointed: to do justice between the parties"": at 133. That might be thought to be too limited a description of the concept. However, his Honour accepted a broader view at 134, in relation to the protection of confidential information: 

""It is in the interests of the administration of justice that the very proceedings before the Court should not be permitted to destroy or seriously depreciate the value of such confidential information. If it were otherwise, not only might the parties and members of the public consider the Court was not paying proper regard to confidentiality but also it might open the way to abuse.""

48The broader concept of the administration of justice, including consequences not just for the present case but for future cases, including the supply of information from victims of unlawful conduct and the willingness of witnesses to give evidence, accords with the approach taken in this Court: see John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers and managers appointed) v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 at 161 D-E (Mahoney JA, Hope AJA agreeing), approved in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court at [47] (Spigelman CJ, Handley JA and MW Campbell AJA agreeing) and in R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; 64 NSWLR 335 at [13] (Hodgson JA), [34] (Howie J) and [38]-[40] (Rothman J); see also Batistatos v Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW [2006] HCA 27; 226 CLR 256 at [12]. Each of these cases was dealing with the implied power of courts, operating prior to the commencement of the Suppression Orders Act, and each involved orders which impinged on the operation of the open justice principle. Accepting that broad view, at least in some circumstances, the factors referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of s 8(1) may overlap with (a), because orders falling within those paragraphs might also be necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

49This Court recently accepted that the ""principle of legality"" favours a construction of s 8 which has ""the least adverse impact upon the open justice principle and common law freedom of speech"": Rinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403 at [26] (Bathurst CJ and McColl JA). However, that approach may have a more limited application in circumstances where the proposed order does not impact upon the open justice principle because it does not prevent or restrict publication of court proceedings. The ""common law freedom of speech"" is not to be disregarded, but it provides a lesser obstacle to an order designed to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

50There is another relevant principle to be considered. Section 7 does not directly constrain free speech: rather, it confers upon a court a power to make orders which may have that effect. That characterisation engages the principle that a statutory conferral of power, at least with respect to a superior court, should not be read down by reference to implied limitations: Owners of Ship 'Shin Kobe Maru' v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54; 181 CLR 404 at 420-421.

51It is therefore desirable to distinguish between two kinds of constraint referred to above, namely constraints on publication of material disclosed in court proceedings and publication of material having no connection with court proceedings except its capacity to affect current or future proceedings. Because the orders in the present case do not fall within the first category they do not involve any constraint upon the principle of open justice; they do not impinge in any way on the rights of the applicants to publish what may happen at the trial. Rather they are limited to the pre-trial (and on-going) publication of material having a tendency to interfere with the fairness of the anticipated trial. An order designed to protect the proper administration of justice, without impinging upon the principle of open justice, may well be considered necessary so long as it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieve its perceived purpose: compare Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2010] HCA 21; 240 CLR 651 at [31] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ) and Thomas at [102] (Gummow and Crennan JJ). On this approach, the reasoning of McHugh JA in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal (NSW) (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476-477, referred to by French CJ in Hogan v Hinch [2011] HCA 4; 243 CLR 506 at [21] and by this Court in Reinhart at [29], is not determinative in the present case.

(d) Scope of power to prevent interference
52Accepting that s 7 extends to allow a court (not limited to the Supreme Court) to make orders preventing threatened interference with a trial, the next inquiry is whether it extends the scope of such powers as exist in superior courts under the general law. It is therefore necessary to consider the scope of the sub judice rule.

53The general law is concerned with the effects of pre-trial publicity. That focuses not on the legality or otherwise of the conduct of the publisher, but on whether the accused will be able to obtain a fair trial. Its most frequent application is to be found in proceedings for contempt of court, brought after publication. However, there are a small number of cases in which pre-publication restraints have been sought under the general law, often as an adjunct to contempt proceedings in relation to material already published: see Attorney General (NSW) v Time Inc Magazine Company Pty Ltd [1994] NSWCA 134 (Kirby P, Handley and Sheller JJA). In Attorney General v Random House Group Ltd [2009] EWHC 1727 (QB), Tugendhat J considered an application for a prohibition on the further sale of a book already published. He considered the stakes involved in a pending terrorism retrial were so high that the injunction ought be granted.

54Most pre-trial non-publication orders have related to the publication of evidence or other material disclosed in the course of a trial. Thus, in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court (at [37] above), the Court was concerned with a non-publication order made by Norrish DCJ in relation to verdicts of guilty in one trial, when there were further trials to be heard. The principal issue was whether the District Court judge, absent a statutory conferral, had power to make such an order. (This is no longer an issue since the commencement of the Suppression Orders Act.) Spigelman CJ (Handley JA and MW Campbell AJA agreeing) referred more generally to the undesirability of such orders:

""[59] It is conceivable that media publicity may create a situation in which an accused will not be able to have a fair trial within a reasonable period or at all. In that circumstance an anticipatory non-publication order may be needed to ensure fairness to the prosecution. However, that exceptional case is so unlikely that it cannot form the basis for an implication of a power on a test of necessity. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases ....

[60] If the truly exceptional case ever arises it can be handled by the exercise of the protective inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In any event, I find it quite inconceivable that such a case could emerge from the publication of a verdict after anything like normal publicity of the course of a trial.
...

[64] I have not overlooked the fact that the ability of a stay or adjournment to ensure a fair trial has been substantially attenuated by the immediate accessibility of information on the internet with an efficiency that overrides the practical obscurity of the past. This accessibility poses significant challenges for the administration of criminal justice. ...

[65] ... In Burrell [[2004] NSWCCA 185] at [39] I indicated that it may be desirable for the Crown to conduct searches in advance of a trial and, where necessary, request Australian-based websites to remove references to an accused for the period of a trial. In New South Wales the standard directions to a jury warn the jury not to access internet databases. In some cases it may be necessary to return to the past practice of sequestering the jury. In some cases a judge-alone trial may be appropriate.""

55Non-publication orders in relation to interlocutory appeals and appeals in respect of convictions where other trials are anticipated on further charges are by no means uncommon. (Whether they are always necessary is not a question which needs to be addressed: they are made in appeals because judgments and rulings in trials, other than in the Supreme Court, are not routinely published on a web site.) In any event, there is a distinction to be drawn between non-publication of material revealed in the course of one proceeding, but potentially capable of interfering with another, and non-publication of material not derived from a legal proceeding, but capable of interfering with one. As explained by Mason CJ in Hinch v Attorney General (Vic) [1987] HCA 56; 164 CLR 15 at 26:

""Reports of court proceedings are not a true example of the public interest in the administration of justice yielding to the public interest in freedom of discussion. Rather it is a case where on balance the wider interests of the administration of justice are thought, as the law currently stands, to be better served by allowing publicity.""

56In General Television Corporation Pty Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions [2008] VSCA 49; 19 VR 68, the Victorian Court of Appeal (Warren CJ, Vincent and Kellam JJA) considered an appeal against a direction that the appellant not publish certain episodes of a series entitled Underbelly, which was scheduled to run during the trial of one of the persons depicted in the series. The trial judge, King J, had made two orders in the following terms:

""1. The transmission, publication, broadcasting or exhibiting of the production referred to as 'Underbelly' be prohibited in the State of Victoria until after the completion of the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [A]. 

2. Direct that the television series referred to as ""Underbelly"" not be published on the internet in Victoria and the ""Family Tree site - inside the Underbelly, which looks at the evolving relationships between the key characters"" be prohibited until after the trial and verdict in the matter of [A].""

57The Court focused on the breadth of the orders and the fact that they sought to bind every person in Victoria: at [65]. The Court concluded that it ""was not necessary"" for the first order to be in such wide terms and that an order against the applicant not to publish the program in Victoria until after the completion of the trial was all that was required: at [65] and [67]. Their Honours continued at [68]:

""However, the fact that the above order is directed against the applicant only should not be misunderstood. It should not be treated by persons other than the named applicant as giving them carte blanche to publish any part of Underbelly howsoever the same may have been obtained by them. Obviously, any person with knowledge of the order who saw fit to publish Underbelly in Victoria prior to the verdict in the matter of R v [A] would run a grave risk of being found to have committed a contempt of court.""

58The Court also restricted the operation of order 2 to the applicant and related corporate entities. The Court noted at [70]:

""We recognise that there is a considerable amount of material upon the internet which may be seen to relate whether accurately, or otherwise, to the matters which will be the subject of the trial. Indeed it was acknowledged by counsel for the applicant that Channel 9 appreciated that once the program was broadcast nationally on 13 February 2008 there is a high likelihood that it would be downloaded from the internet and available world wide to those who could access it. ... Obviously the immediate accessibility of such information will require clear directions from the trial judge to the jury. As has been observed in other cases, this accessibility poses substantial challenges for the administration of justice.""

59The power of a court to make orders binding the world at large was first discussed in cases concerned with the publication of information revealed in the course of a hearing. Those cases involved restraints on the operation of the open justice principle. In Attorney General v Leveller Magazine Ltd [1979] AC 440, Lord Diplock stated at 451-452:

""It may be that a 'ruling' by the court as to the conduct of proceedings can have binding effect as such within the courtroom only, so that breach of it is not ipso facto a contempt of court unless it is committed there. Nevertheless where (1) the reason for a ruling which involves departing in some measure from the general principle of open justice within the courtroom is that the departure is necessary in the interests of the due administration of justice and (2) it would be apparent to anyone who is aware of the ruling that the result which the ruling is designed to achieve would be frustrated by a particular kind of act done outside the courtroom, the doing of such an act with knowledge of the ruling and of its purpose may constitute a contempt of court, not because it is a breach of the ruling but because it interferes with the due administration of justice.""

60This approach was accepted by the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal of NSW at 477 and 479 (McHugh JA, Glass JA agreeing). McHugh JA stated at 477C:

""An order made in court is no doubt binding on the parties, the witnesses and other persons in the courtroom. But an order purporting to operate as a common rule and to bind people generally is an exercise of legislative - not judicial - power. Nevertheless, conduct outside the courtroom which deliberately frustrates the effect of an order made to enable a court to act effectively within its jurisdiction may constitute a contempt of court. But the conduct will be a contempt because the person involved has intentionally interfered with the proper administration of justice and not because he was bound by the order itself.""

61One question is whether the general law permits an order which prohibits public access to existing material. In principle there is no reason to think it does not. In the unlikely event that a library holding of a past issue of a newspaper, book or magazine (perhaps containing a prejudicial story about the accused) were thought to be a threat to a fair trial, a superior court would have jurisdiction to order that there be no public access to that material until the conclusion of a trial. An order preventing access to a publication on a web site is no different in kind and would clearly fall within the scope of s 7. The circumstances of engagement of the power, contained in s 8(1)(a), also reflect the language of the general law principle. 

62The obligation of a juror, encapsulated in the oath or affirmation, is to ""give a true verdict according to the evidence"": Jury Act 1977 (NSW), s 72A. It is an offence for a juror to ""make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror"": s 68C(1). The words ""making an inquiry"" include conducting any electronic search of a database for information: s 68C(5)(b). That language extends to ""causing someone else to make an inquiry"": s 68C(5)(e). The standard direction given to juries at the beginning of a trial covers that negative obligation. 

63These provisions demonstrate the impropriety of a juror obtaining information outside the course of the trial, which might potentially affect his or her view of matters in issue during the trial. However, it does not follow that the trial judge, in exercising powers with respect to the conduct of the trial, can make peremptory orders requiring private individuals or other entities unconnected with the administration of justice to take steps to remove material from potential access by a juror. If s 7 has conferred such a power, it would be a remarkable consequence of the language employed. There is no suggestion in the New South Wales Law Reform Commission Report, Contempt by Publication, that any such power previously existed, nor that it was intended to be conferred by statute. No case was drawn to the attention of the Court where such an order had been made by a trial judge before the commencement of the Act. The language of equivalent provisions, such as s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act, is limited to an order ""forbidding or restricting the publication of particular evidence"". It is clear that s 7(a) in combination with s 8(1)(a) is capable of extending further than that, but not that it expands the powers of a superior court under the general law to prevent sub judice contempt. 

64The remaining question is whether novel problems are created with respect to the fairness of criminal trials where there is significant prejudicial material available on the internet. In Digital News Media Pty Ltd v Mokbel [2010] VSCA 51; 30 VR 248 the Victorian Court of Appeal considered the propriety (rather than the validity) of orders directing specific persons to remove material from their web sites and prohibiting them from publishing such articles in the future: at [60]. The statutory power relied on in that case, found in ss 18 and 19 of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic), did not extend to an order restricting or suppressing publication of material which might endanger the holding of a fair trial. Warren CJ and Byrne AJA stated at [48]:

""The general suppression order cannot be supported by s 18; it must depend upon the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. It would seem that in making these orders his Honour was exercising a power to grant a quia timet injunction to restrain the publication of material which he apprehended was likely to be published and would, if published, have jeopardised the forthcoming murder trial and Mr Mokbel's other pending trials. There is no doubt that this Court has such a power. In General Television Corporation Pty Ltd v DPP [at [21]] the Court of Appeal recently so held.""

65Their Honours held (Buchanan JA dissenting) that the orders were not necessary. 

66Two judges conducting criminal trials in the Supreme Court of New South Wales have thought it appropriate to make suppression orders in relation to material available on the internet. In R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1102 Price J dismissed an application to vacate orders limited to identifying specific articles and the web sites from which they were to be removed. The challenge was based on the futility of the order. His Honour noted at [44]:

""The inability of a court to remove all offending material does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the provision of the relief sought would be futile. In General Television ... the Victorian Court of Appeal (Warren CJ, Vincent and Kellam JJA) recast an internet order so that it was specifically directed at the applicant in that case and the website within its control notwithstanding that there was a deal of material which would otherwise be available on the internet.""

67Price J further stated at [55], after identifying the directions that he proposed to give to jurors at the trial:

""Although I accept that the jury will abide by my directions I consider that I should do all that I can to assist them in making their task easier. Notwithstanding the age of the articles, their immediate accessibility on the applicants' websites by keying in the names of the accused causes, in my opinion, a real risk of prejudice to the accuseds' right to a fair trial.""

68In R v Debs [2011] NSWSC 1248 RS Hulme J made an order in terms not dissimilar to those in the present case. The information which was not to be published was, arguably, more specific than that identified in the present orders, but the order was in general terms that ""there be no publication"" of the offending information: at [52]. His Honour explained at [40]:

""Thus, as I apprehend the operation of the Act, a non-publication order made in unqualified terms would immediately bind not only the media organisations listed above but also organisations such as the owners of Wikipedia, Google and the other search engines but they would commit no offence until notified of the order and guilty of conduct otherwise constituting contempt of court or a breach of s 16(1).""

69It is convenient to refer in this context to the terms of s 16 of the Suppression Orders Act. That provision states:

""16 Contravention of order

(1) A person commits an offence if the person engages in conduct that constitutes a contravention of a suppression order or non-publication order and is reckless as to whether the conduct constitutes a contravention of a suppression order or non-publication order. 

Maximum penalty: 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both, for an individual or 5,000 penalty units for a body corporate.

(2) Conduct that constitutes an offence under this section may be punished as a contempt of court even though it could be punished as an offence.

(3) Conduct that constitutes an offence under this section may be punished as an offence even though it could be punished as a contempt of court.

(4) If conduct constitutes both an offence under this section and a contempt of court, the offender is not liable to be punished twice.""

70The assumption that there is no offence committed under s 16 unless the person has had the order brought to their attention is no doubt correct. However, it invites consideration as to how an internet content host or search engine operator in another country can properly be given notice of the order or be the subject of enforcement proceedings.

Application of State law
71The applicants mounted a challenge to the order in the present case, based on -
(a) the absence of any demonstrable necessity, and
(b) the futility of making such an order.

72For reasons discussed above in relation to the proper operation of the section, there are problems with the form of the order. First, it is not directed to any person or persons and, indeed, is little more than a general statement of principle in relation to specific material. So much is revealed by the opening words stating, after reference to geographical limits of the Commonwealth of Australia, that ""there is to be"" no disclosure of certain categories of material. Assuming, as the evidence reveals, that such material may be available on the internet despite its removal from sites controlled by the applicants, there are serious questions raised as to whether a whole range of businesses which provide access to the internet through public use of computers may fall within the terms of the order. Secondly, there is a question as to whether internet service providers, which make available search engines permitting access to material without knowledge of the relevant URLs, may also be caught by the terms of the order, if the access is had anywhere in Australia.

73Thirdly, the proper administration of justice with respect to a trial to take place in the District Court at Sydney could not conceivably justify an order preventing residents of Perth, Kununurra or Darwin from having access to such material. Indeed, the scope of the order is inherently suspect to the extent that it seeks to prevent the whole population of Australia having access to the offending material, at least for a period, in order to prevent possible access by a juror or member of the jury panel for a particular case.

74The rationale over such overreach is presumably that, unlike radio broadcasts or even the distribution of newspapers, there is no geographical limit to material available on the internet. However, as the applicants submitted, the fact that it is not possible to control material on servers outside Australia demonstrates the limited value of an order seeking to control availability on servers inside the country. No doubt it is arguable that most of the offending material, being of more topical than national let alone international interest, will be found on servers within the country, and even perhaps within New South Wales. However, that may underestimate the likelihood that such material is also available from other sources. Given the efficiency of modern search engines, limiting the number of sources, without removing them all, is likely to be ineffective.

75No specific attention was given to the fact that the order purported to prevent access in other States. Whether a judge of the District Court had power to control the access of parties and citizens so broadly might itself raise a serious question for consideration. As it was not addressed, it should not be pursued.

76An order will also fail the necessity test if it is futile. An order will not necessarily be futile because material is available otherwise in cached form, from which it may be removed once the source page has been removed, or is available on web sites overseas. The mere fact that a search has revealed many thousands of ""hits"" does not necessarily mean that offending material has been readily located. It is necessary to refer to items which have been given priority in response to the search.

77Further, the test of necessity will not readily be satisfied without proper consideration as to whether a jury is likely to abide by the directions it will be given to decide a matter only by reference to the material called in evidence and without carrying out any investigations themselves. Circumstances may differ. A juror might be thought to be more likely to look for offending material, despite a direction, if such material is of recent origin and if he or she has some recollection of its existence, than in other circumstances. This is a matter for consideration by each judge asked to make such an order.

78As a matter of construction, that which is ineffective cannot be described as ""necessary"". The orders made in the District Court were ineffective for two reasons. First, to be effective they had to bind numerous parties who were not before the Court. Indeed, it is not possible to know, on the evidence, who those parties are. They will either include those in control of the content of web sites throughout the world which may contain the offending material, or those who operate search engines, or both categories. Secondly, even if it were possible to identify all relevant parties, enforcement against any party not resident in or operating from New South Wales would be impracticable, if not impossible. Accepting the evidence that cached material might not provide a source of access once the original document were removed, it remains unclear as to how many web sites containing the relevant information have it in cached form. Accordingly, the evidence failed to demonstrate that the orders would be effective.

79As a matter of principle, to make the orders effective, material must either be removed from any web site globally to which access can be had from New South Wales or there must be an ability to prevent access by people living in New South Wales. The evidence did not disclose that either of these was a realistic possibility. Certainly the orders made no attempt to identify any such possibility.

80For these reasons, the orders were properly described as ineffective and therefore were not necessary. As they did not satisfy the ground identified in s 8(1)(a) of the Suppression Orders Act, they should not have been made. However, the last point of principle raises starkly the question as to their constitutional validity.

Constitutional validity
(a) construction of Commonwealth law
81The basis for inconsistency with the State law was said to be Schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act and, in particular, Part 9, containing cll 90 and 91. It is convenient to commence with cl 90:

""90 Concurrent operation of State and Territory laws

It is the intention of the Parliament that this Schedule is not to apply to the exclusion of a law of a State or Territory to the extent to which that law is capable of operating concurrently with this Schedule.""

82The words ""is not to apply to the exclusion of"" has the same meaning as ""does not exclude the operation of"". It is a form of language commonly adopted to avoid the implication that the Commonwealth law was intended to be an exclusive statement in respect of the subject matter or the ""legislative field"" in which it operates: see R v Credit Tribunal; Ex parte General Motors Acceptance Corporation (Australia) [1977] HCA 34; 137 CLR 545 (in relation to s 75(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) and University of Wollongong v Metwally [1984] HCA 74; 158 CLR 447, considering the retrospective operation of a similar clause, s 6A of the Racial Discrimination Act.

83Despite the language of cl 90, cl 91 is in categorical terms:

""91 Liability of internet content hosts and internet service providers under State and Territory laws etc

(1) A law of a State or Territory, or a rule of common law or equity, has no effect to the extent to which it: 

(a) subjects, or would have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of subjecting, an internet content host to liability (whether criminal or civil) in respect of hosting particular internet content in a case where the host was not aware of the nature of the internet content; or 
(b) requires, or would have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of requiring, an internet content host to monitor, make inquiries about, or keep records of, internet content hosted by the host; or 
(c) subjects, or would have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of subjecting, an internet service provider to liability (whether criminal or civil) in respect of carrying particular internet content in a case where the service provider was not aware of the nature of the internet content; or 
(d) requires, or would have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of requiring, an internet service provider to monitor, make inquiries about, or keep records of, internet content carried by the provider.

(2) The Minister may, by written instrument, exempt a specified law of a State or Territory, or a specified rule of common law or equity, from the operation of subclause (1).""

84It was common ground that there was no exemption (or no relevant exemption) for the purposes of sub-cl (2). So far as sub-cl (1) is concerned, it conveniently divides into two parts, pars (a) and (b) relating to internet content hosts and pars (c) and (d) relating to internet service providers. Reading each pair of provisions together, the effect of sub-cl (1) is to exclude the operation of a State law which either subjects the relevant party to a liability in respect of content, of the nature of which it was not aware, or requires the party to monitor or make inquiries about that content. Accordingly, the combined effect of cll 90 and 91 is that a State law which imposes liability on, for example, a content host in respect of content of which it is aware continues to operate. However, the second limb of the prohibition in respect of a content host would prevent a State law imposing an obligation on the content host to monitor, and thereby make itself aware of, the content which it is hosting.

85Relevantly for the purposes of these provisions, the following definitions apply, as found in Schedule 5 - Online services:

""3 Definitions

In this Schedule, unless the contrary intention appears:
...

data storage device means any article or material (for example, a disk) from which information is capable of being reproduced, with or without the aid of any other article or device.
...

internet carriage service means a listed carriage service that enables end-users to access the internet. 

internet content means information that:

(a) is kept on a data storage device; and 
(b) is accessed, or available for access, using an internet carriage service;

but does not include:

(c) ordinary electronic mail; or 
(d) information that is transmitted in the form of a broadcasting service. 

internet content host means a person who hosts internet content in Australia, or who proposes to host internet content in Australia. 

internet service provider has the meaning given by clause 8.

listed carriage service has the same meaning as in the Telecommunications Act 1997.

...

8 Internet service providers

Basic definition

(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, if a person supplies, or proposes to supply, an internet carriage service to the public, the person is an internet service provider.
...

9 Supply to the public 

(1) This clause sets out the circumstances in which an internet carriage service is taken, for the purposes of subclause 8(1), to be supplied to the public. 

(2) If: 

(a) an internet carriage service is used for the carriage of information between 2 end-users; and 
(b) each end-user is outside the immediate circle of the supplier of the service;

the service is supplied to the public. 

Note: If a company makes internet content available for access on the internet, and an individual obtains access to the content using an internet carriage service, the company and the individual are end-users in relation to the carriage of the content by the internet carriage service.""

86There was debate in the course of the appeal as to whether the applicants, or any of them, were properly identified as internet content hosts. (It was not submitted that they were internet service providers.) The point sought to be made was that the material they were required to remove from their web sites was material which they had produced. The submission was that a ""host"", not being a defined term, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance, namely one who provides service or accommodation to another. One is not a host to oneself or one's own family. Accordingly, so the submission went, a party controlling a web site was not a ""content host"" to the extent that it produced the content. Whether the submission accepted that it was a host in respect of a site containing not only its content, but also messages uploaded by, for example, external bloggers, was unclear.

87The Court received little assistance from the parties in respect of the language used in Schedule 5. It may be that such assistance is not readily available, the term ""internet content host"" not being usefully defined nor, perhaps, having any settled industry content. One commentator has remarked that the terms ""internet service provider"" and ""internet content host"" are ""jargon without any settled meaning"": Forum: Internet Content Control (2000) 23 UNSWLJ; Niranjan Arasaratnam, ""Brave New (Online) World"" 205 at 210. The author continued:

""The Act assumes that these terms are static and immutable when in reality they are evolving together with the medium in which they operate.""

88Judicial discussion is limited and has not always distinguished between hosts and service providers: see, eg, in a decision pre-dating Schedule 5, Trumpet Software Pty Ltd v OzEmail Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 560; 34 IPR 481 at 484 (Heerey J); and later, .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 424; 207 ALR 521 at [3] (Finkelstein J). More assistance may be obtained from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [2002] AATA 449 where Deputy President Forgie stated:

""11. Information on the Internet such as a page on the World Wide Web is known as Internet content. Just as a computer on the internet is uniquely identified, so too is each piece of Internet content. It is identified by its URL. The URL identifies the protocol used to access the content, or type of content, the computer on which it is located and the location of the computer. Although uniquely identified, the Internet content is not static and may be changed as the content of the Internet site is updated.

12. Content must be hosted on the Internet. Some creators of Internet content host their own Internet content. Most pay an Internet content host to host it on their behalf. In turn, the Internet content host agrees to place the content on a data storage device or server and to make the content available on the Internet. Creators of Internet content are largely free to select their Internet content host.""

89Questions of copyright infringement by downloading material from the internet were discussed by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd [2011] FCAFC 23; 194 FCR 285 and, on appeal, by the High Court in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd [2012] HCA 16, in each case without extensive discussion of ""hosts"". As explained by French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, the respondent was an Australian internet service provider which gives its customers access to the internet in return for a monthly fee: at [2]. The question was whether iiNet had infringed copyright in the appellants' films by permitting its customers to have access to the films using a peer-to-peer file sharing system. There was no need to discuss the concept of an internet content host. The Court was satisfied that iiNet was not involved with the file sharing system and further was ""not a host of infringing material, or of web sites which make available .torrent files relating to infringing material"": at [65]. A similar point was made by Gummow and Hayne JJ at [112], noting that the respondent itself ""could not take down the infringing material because it was not acting as host"", referring, by comparison, to Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187; 156 FCR 380.

90It is sufficient for present purposes to accept, as explained by Forgie DP in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that an internet content host may include any party in control of a web site to which material has been uploaded. Whether it is uploaded by an agent of the party controlling the web site, or even that party itself, the party remains a content host.

91In the end, this debate was somewhat sterile as its purpose appeared to be to ensure that the applicants could not be liable for breach of the order in relation to material of which they were not aware, the underlying assumption being that they would relevantly be ""aware of"" material which they or their officers or agents had uploaded. However, once it is accepted that a State law could not validly impose liability with respect to content of which they were not aware, or impose on them an obligation to monitor or make inquiries about content on their web sites, it became unnecessary to determine whether or not they were internet content hosts, for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-cl 91(1). (It appears that similar issues are under review in New Zealand: see Donna Buckingham, ""Keeping Justice Blind Online: Suppression Regimes and Digital Publishing"" (2011) 12 Otago L Rev 557 at 563.)

(b) the question of inconsistency
92The NSW Law Reform Commission accepted that ""the sub judice rule acts as an important shield against jurors being exposed to material which the rules of evidence would otherwise keep from them"": at [2.18]. It recommended that the rule be retained: at [2.76]. In reaching that conclusion, it referred to problems arising from information contained on web sites available through internet service providers and internet content hosts: at [2.63]. It noted the absence of case law considering whether those responsible for web sites could be found liable for contempt of court in respect of information available through web sites under their control. It recommended that an internet service provider or host which became aware of a contemptuous publication should have an obligation to take steps within its means to prevent the material from being ""further published"": at [2.65]. It recommended a defence based on lack of control over the content and that they ""either did not know the content contained the material or, having become aware of this, took all reasonable steps to prevent it being published"": at [2.65]. The recommendation is not entirely coherent: if limited to content of which they were aware, the defence seems unnecessarily broad. Whether such a statutory provision would be consistent with the Broadcasting Services Act was not addressed. The scope of the proposed defence made in the draft Bill attached to the Report (cl 15) related only to proceedings for contempt of court.

93The critical question is whether the Suppression Orders Act permits an order which could, directly or indirectly, subject an internet content host to a form of liability, whether civil or criminal, or could require a host to make relevant inquiries. That in turn depends upon whether the State scheme was intended to do more than confer on a court, which might not otherwise have had such a power, the power to restrain a threatened contempt by a particular party by reference to the publication of specified matter. Prior to the commencement of the Suppression Orders Act, and legislation in like form in other jurisdictions, there appears to have been little history of quia timet injunctions in respect of threatened contempts. According to usual principles relating to such relief, a party must have some basis for its fear that a particular breach of a statutory or common law right may occur. 

94In relation to material on the internet, it would, no doubt, be a relatively simple task for the Director of Public Prosecutions, in respect of a particular forthcoming trial, to conduct an internet search and identify web sites containing material to which the public had access and which might tend to prejudice the fairness of the forthcoming trial. (Such a course was suggested nine years ago by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Ltd at [65].) The particular internet content host could then be made aware by the Director of the material and asked to remove it. If it did not act within a reasonable time as requested, it would be open to the Director to seek an order from the court in respect of that material. Assuming that the court was satisfied that the material did have the feared tendency, an order directed to that internet content host, relating to specified material of which it had been made aware, would not contravene the constitutional limits of the State law. The statute could validly support such an order.

95The statute could not, however, validly support an order addressed to the world at large, which might well cover material on internet sites of which the hosts were unaware. However, as discussed above, unless the statute provided a remarkable expansion of the common law principles with respect to sub judice contempt, such an order would be invalid in any event, because not supported by the State Act, according to its proper construction.

96To the extent that Part 2 of the Suppression Orders Act permits the Court to make an order imposing an obligation on an internet content host to remove, or otherwise restrict access to, content, of the nature of which it was not aware, there would be inconsistency with Schedule 5 of the Commonwealth Act. Similarly, to the extent that an order could be made requiring it to inquire of, or monitor, the content hosted on its web sites, of the nature of which it was not otherwise aware, such a law would be inconsistent with Schedule 5 of the Commonwealth Act.

Conclusions
97It is something of an irony that the applicants in the present case are, on one view, the only people against whom an order could properly have been made. Whether they were aware of the offending material at the time the order was made is not clearly revealed by the evidence. They are now aware of it and, in any event, it has apparently been removed to the satisfaction of the Director and the accused persons.

98An order under the Suppression Orders Act should be in a form which would be appropriate in the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, to prevent an apprehended breach of the sub judice principle. Further, the test of necessity will not usually be satisfied unless a request has been made to the parties thought to be in breach to remove the offending material and who, after a reasonable opportunity, have failed, or have indicated they do not intend, to take that step.

99The State law constrains the circumstances in which and the form of order which can be made: the order must be ""necessary"" to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. For an order to be necessary, the general law principles of sub judice contempt must be thought, in particular circumstances, to be inadequate in themselves. That may be because there is a dispute between one or more of the parties to the criminal proceedings and the publisher as to whether the material has the offending tendency. Other forms of dispute could be envisaged: for example, a dispute as to whether a particular publisher has the legal authority to remove material identified on a particular web site. 

100Similarly, a view must be formed that potential jurors may obtain access to such material, if not removed, or that empanelled jurors may be disinclined to accept directions, backed by criminal sanctions, not to seek access to such material. Absent some basis for considering that a specific order is necessary in support of the general law principle, there would be no necessity for such an order. 

101It is not necessary for present purposes to consider the extent to which a pre-emptive order could be made in respect of a proposed publication or in respect of identified material which is available for public access and under the control of a specific individual. The present order is generic in effect, refers to no specific material, nor to any identified web site or controller. If invalid because beyond the power conferred by s 8, no party suggested it could be severed in part, so as to leave a valid order.

102Section 109 of the Constitution prevents the Suppression Orders Act supporting an order directed to an internet content host which is not aware of the material to which the order refers at the time it is made. Nor can it support an order requiring such a host to monitor or make inquiry about the content of such material.

103It follows that Order 3 made by the trial judge on 26 March 2012 was beyond the power conferred on the District Court by Part 2 of the Suppression Orders Act.

104These being criminal proceedings, it would not be appropriate to make an order for costs against the parties to the proceedings. There is no indication in the Suppression Orders Act that this Court should exercise any power to award costs. There is no reason to treat the costs of these proceedings as otherwise than costs of proceedings ""preliminary or incidental"" to an appeal and thus subject to the no costs regime provided by s 17(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

105The Court should make the following order and note:

(1) Set aside orders 3, 4 and 5 made by Bennett DCJ in the District Court on 26 March 2012 and the further ancillary and consequential orders made on 28 March 2012.

(2) The Court notes that any continued or further publication of material having a tendency to interfere with the administration of justice in respect of the forthcoming trial of the second, third and fourth respondents may, despite the discharge of the orders referred to above, constitute a contempt of court.

106WHEALY JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA. I agree with his reasons and the comments made by the Chief Justice in his additional remarks.

2708124,R v Ezegbe [2012] NSWDC 292,"Judgment



1HIS HONOUR: I have before me an application by Mr Ezegbe to withdraw his plea of guilty. It is important of course to examine the circumstances in which that plea was entered.

2His trial was listed to commence before her Honour Judge Tupman on Tuesday 27 November 2012. The jury were empanelled the following day, Wednesday 28 November 2012, and a not guilty plea was entered in the jury's presence. The accused was then put in charge of the jury. The trial followed the normal course. The prosecution case commenced. It concluded on Monday 3 December 2012 and then the accused, Mr Ezegbe, gave evidence.

3During the course of his cross-examination the trial was adjourned. 

4The following morning, 4 December 2012, following an indication from Mr Ezegbe's counsel that Mr Ezegbe wished now to plead guilty, he was rearraigned in the presence of the jury. Her Honour accepted that plea and discharged the jury. It is in those circumstances that the plea of guilty is now sought to be withdrawn.

5Mr Naughtin relies on affidavits indicating the circumstances which he says explain why there was a change of plea to guilty during the course of the trial. He submits that it would be in the interests of justice for the plea of guilty to be withdrawn. The Crown however relies on s 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act and says that I have no jurisdiction to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn.

6It is important to understand the history behind s 157. In what I will call the olden days, once a jury had been put in charge of an accused after a plea of not guilty and the accused changed his or her plea to guilty, it was the jury who delivered the verdict of guilty. What usually happened is that the accused would be rearraigned in the presence of the jury, the accused would enter the plea of guilty, the judge would say to the jury something along the lines of ""I cannot direct you to find the accused guilty, but given the plea of guilty that is what you should do,"" and hopefully the jury would oblige by returning the verdict of guilty. Clearly, the accused, having been found guilty, and I emphasise the word ""found"" guilty by a jury, could not seek to overturn that verdict by seeking to withdraw the plea of guilty he had entered before them. It was a verdict of a jury based on the evidence that the jury had heard.

7The procedure was always fraught with the potential for something to go wrong, (see for example R v Ross [1994] NSWCCA unreported 20 April 1994), so s 399A of the Crimes Act was introduced. It later became s 92 of the Criminal Procedure Act and even later became s 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act, where it is today. Section 157 provides that,

""(1), if an accused person pleads guilty to an offence at any time after having been given into the charge of a jury, and the court accepts the plea, the court is to discharge the jury from giving a verdict in the matter and to find the accused person guilty of the offence.

(2), the finding has effect as if it were the verdict of the jury and the accused person is liable to punishment accordingly.""


8The important part for present purposes is the phrase ""the finding has effect as if it were the verdict of the jury."" What the section means is that although it is the judge who finds the accused guilty, it is as though the jury had returned a verdict of guilty, so there would be no jurisdiction for the judge, or any other judge, to later entertain an application for the accused to withdraw the plea of guilty. That this is the result was confirmed in R v Houra [2001] 121 A Crim R 472, and in R v Kaewklom (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1117. 

9The Courts have until recently spoken with only one voice about this issue, although it would be remiss of me not to mention a recently published decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Ghurung v R [2012] NSWCCA 2001. That case does suggest it is possible for an accused to withdraw a plea of guilty, even where it had been entered and accepted by a judge, on the second day of her trial and after she had been put in charge of the jury following her plea of not guilty. It does not appear from the judgment that s 157, much less either of the authorities that I have referred to, was drawn to the court's attention and, as the judgment makes clear, the Court was under pressure of time. Ghurung I regret to say is wrong. It is inconsistent with an earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Houra, and a judgment of a single judge of the Supreme Court, Kaewklom, and so it should not be followed. It does not bind me given that there are inconsistent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

10The result is that the Crown's argument should be accepted. There is no jurisdiction to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn. Section 157 is clearly not a section which gives a discretion to the judge as to how the judge should treat a finding of guilt in the circumstances of this trial. 

11It has not been necessary for those reasons to consider any of the matters raised in the affidavits as to the things that would ordinarily be considered when there is an application to withdraw a plea of guilty such as the accused's understanding of what was happening, whether his will was overborne, and things of that kind. Those matters are irrelevant because I simply do not have jurisdiction to do what Mr Ezegbe asks me to do.

12The application is therefore refused. The matter will be listed before her Honour Judge Tupman on Thursday 6 June for her Honour to, I expect, sentence Mr Ezegbe.

2708131,R v DA-PRA [2012] NSWSC 607,"SENTENCE
1RS HULME J:  On 21 May 2012, the Prisoner was convicted by a jury of three offences committed on 18 December 2009:-
1. That he killed Gervasio Da-Pra in circumstances that amounted to manslaughter.
2. That he murdered Emma Wighton.
3. That he caused grievous bodily harm to Vivienne Wighton with intent to murder her.
2It now falls to me to sentence the Prisoner in respect of these offences.  I instruct myself that any findings I make in the course of doing so which are not necessarily implicit in the jury's verdict must be consistent with those verdicts, that any findings which tend to go in aggravation of the Prisoner's criminality must be made beyond reasonable doubt but in the case of any that go in mitigation, it is sufficient if I find them on the balance of probability.
3There was no dispute in the trial that the Prisoner had committed the physical acts necessarily involved in these offences.  In the case of all three offences, the major issues were whether the Prisoner had established the defences of mental illness or substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  In the case of the second and third offences, there was also a subsidiary issue whether they came about as an incident of the Prisoner attempting to create a diversion or alibi in consequence of the first offence.
4The only evidence as to the circumstances of the death of Gervasio Da-Pra came only from persons such as the police and pathologist who came upon the scenes of events subsequently and from the Prisoner.  The latter's account of those circumstances to a psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt, is consistent with what was seen by the others and may be accepted.  According to Dr Allnutt, on the morning of 18 December, the Prisoner:-
""... woke up feeling anxious and nervous.  He wanted to speak to his father to tell him he had to give the bikies what they wanted.  He did not know how to tell his father he was going to die, that the bikies were going to kill him.  He decided he needed to tell his father, however, to save his mother and he intended to tell his father that the bikies were coming to the house and if he did not give them what they wanted they would kill him and torture his mother.  
He went and spoke to his father; he told him people were going to come to the house demanding his mother.  His father did not believe him.  He showed his father the knife to prove he was serious.  He told him it had to do with Boris and they were coming after the family.
He and his father started arguing.  His father was blaming him.  His father thought he was organising the extortion.  He told his father he had to give him what 'they', the bikies, wanted.  At this, his father hit him.  He said he reacted.  He lost his temper and knocked him out.  He believed he had no choice.  His father was not going to listen and give the bikies anything.  He thought his mother was going to die.  He decided he had to kill his father to save his mother.  He hit his father in the throat and suffocated him.  At the time he was scared for his mother.  He did not know what else to do.  He had to kill his father to save his mother.
Afterwards he felt scared his mother might find the body, have a heart attack and a nervous breakdown.  He put the body in the car and took it to the shopping centre.  He left the car there.  He thought the police might find the car.  He did not want his father to be in the car for too long.  He was hoping they would find him.  He did not want to kill himself.  At the time he thought bikies were coming after him and he needed to kill himself to save family and friends.  He thought, if he came to gaol, the bikies would kill him in gaol.
5Dr Allnutt's account of what the Prisoner had told him in that first interview continued:-
He thought of an alibi, he walked back home, he went to the neighbours and told them his car had broken down and he needed to use their phone.  On the way to the neighbours he thought he was being followed.  He knocked on the neighbour's door with the intention of making a phone call to his father to establish an alibi.  He believed he had to get away, the bikies were coming after him.
As the neighbours let him into the house he noticed that there was a blue car he saw following him and turn into the street.  He rushed into the house hoping that they did not see him.  He was distressed at having just killed his father and was anxious.  He went to the toilet and borrowed a phone.  He felt nervous and scared.  He was unsure what to say.  He said the lady came up and grabbed him.  He panicked and reacted.  He hit her in the face.  The lady and the girl started screaming.  He thought the girl pushed him in the back.  At the time he thought it was the people from the car who had come to kill him.  He grabbed his knife and swung around and lashed out with the knife.  He recalled he was slashing.  At the time he thought he was slashing people from the car.  He was scared for his life.  The girl and the mother stopped screaming and he noticed there was blood and realised what he had done.
6In a later interview with Dr Allnutt, the Prisoner added, inter alia, that:-
He decided to go to the neighbours to ring his father.  The neighbours were the first people who came into his head which is why he chose them.  He had not really met them before.  It was a thought that came straight to his head.  He walked to the neighbours.  On the way, he was trying to think about what to say.  He decided he was going to say his car broke down and he needed to call his father.  He thought that by ringing his father this would establish a view that, at the time he rang him, he did not know he was dead.  There was nobody at his home who could witness him making the phone call, so he went to the neighbours.
He told Vivienne Wighton that he needed to use a phone to ring his father.  She opened the door and he thought he saw the same blue car turning into their street.  He panicked and rushed into the house.  
...
After he hit Vivienne Wighton, the thought came to his mind to tie them up.  He needed to get away.  He was scared of getting caught for his father's murder.  He was thinking of tying them up and taking money to get away.  This was the first time that this thought came to his mind.  He needed money to leave the city and get away from the bikies and the police.
7The pathologist Dr Orde could not determine the precise cause of Gervasio Da-Pra's death, but agreed that it flowed one way or another from pressure that had been applied to the deceased's throat.
8The neighbour who let the Prisoner into her house was Vivienne Wighton.  Her account of what occurred there differs in some respects from that of the Prisoner and although I accept that both she and the Prisoner must have been the subject of great stress at the relevant time, I am satisfied that her account is the more reliable.
9Her evidence was to the effect that her door bell rang, she went to the front door, the main door was open but the screen door was locked.  The Prisoner announced who he was and then wrenched open the screen door, came in, sidled along next to the staircase and moving his fingers as if rolling a cigarette.  He was red in the face.  Mrs Wighton sidled opposite until they reached the kitchen.  There he grabbed her hand, swung her around and started punching her.  He punched her twice to the face and she indicated firstly the right side and then the left.  In her words, ""He finished me off"" and she lost consciousness.  Phone records in evidence suggest that the attack on Mrs Wighton occurred before 12.15 pm and certainly before 1.30 pm.
10Much later in the day - the evidence of the paramedics would suggest after 7.00 pm - Mrs Wighton made a 000 call.  When the paramedics attended, they found Emma Wighton dead on the floor in the family room near the kitchen and Mrs Wighton in a side doorway between the entrance hall and the loungeroom.  Both had had their throats cut, in the case of Emma Wighton, the cut extending through the back of her mouth to the spine.  The wound included four shallow ""tails"" into the adjacent skin suggesting a sawing motion of the implement which caused the injuries.  It does not seem to me appropriate to call these cuts slashes and there were no other indications of slashing by the prisoner.
11Emma Wighton had also suffered extensive bruising to the lips and chin that Dr Orde thought unlikely to have been caused by only one blow.  I find there was more than one punch or the like.  There was also a fracture of the skull and other bruising in the area that could have had a number of causes including falling to the floor.  There was some patterned bruising to the upper chest but the evidence was not sufficient to explain this.
12A blood spatter expert called by the Crown and whose evidence I accept concluded that Emma Wighton had been supine at the time her throat was cut.
13Mrs Wighton had also suffered a very extensive cut to her throat from one side to the other.  The larynx, and the anterior jugular veins were completely transected and the left internal jugular vein and the vasavesorum of the left carotid artery were partially transected.  Dr Chin, who operated on Mrs Wighton, gave high praise to the paramedics and hospital emergency staff for Mrs Wighton's survival.
14There was a wealth of evidence which was not challenged and which I accept that, for a substantial period prior to the 18 December 2009, the Prisoner had some belief that he and his family were being pursued by someone called ""Boris"" and a group associated with Boris or bikies.  Although there was limited evidence that these beliefs were not justified, there was some, the trial was conducted upon the basis that they were delusions and I accept that they were. 
15I have referred in recounting Dr Allnutt's evidence of what the Prisoner said to him concerning an alibi.  The Prisoner gave a number of other accounts as to what had occurred and to which reference should be made.  To understand the context of some, it must be mentioned that the Prisoner attended the Emergency Department of the Fairfield Hospital early in the morning of 20 December.  There, he pushed a writing pad across the counter asking the recipient to take it to the police.  The writing pad smelt as if it had been soaked in petrol.  The Prisoner immediately departed.
16On the pad was written a note.  After identifying its author and requesting it be taken to the police, the note commenced, ""If your (sic) reading this, I'm obviously dead"".  In the note the Prisoner referred to the threats to his family that he had perceived and having to kill his father himself.  The note proceeded:-
After killing my father, I was looking for a way to create a diversion, so I went to the neighbours, I was intending to only threaten them, but between what I had just done and what I had to do, I lost all control and in the frenzy I become (sic) a person that even I believe should not exist.  I did have a choice of saving my mother as, I was going to die, but now my only mission in life is to make it home and end my life to hopefully show how sorry I am for what took place ...
17In what was obviously a note written earlier but found some time after the Prisoner's arrest, he had referred to the threats to his family:-
""That left me no choice but to do it myself.  I met someone in a pub in Milperra which decided would give me a hand.  However, while I was cleaning up at my parents', Chuck decided to visit next  , and I was unable to prevent innocent people from their fate.
18The blank in the above passage represents a small section of the note which was destroyed, and which was followed by the letter ""r"".  It seems probable that the word missing is ""door"".  The evidence did not provide any significant guidance as to who ""Chuck"" may have been but does provide good reason to conclude that no-one but the Prisoner was in fact involved.
19At about 7.00 am, then seated in a car outside the hospital, the Prisoner set himself alight.  It is clear that he had poured petrol over himself before doing so.  Police cars were in the immediate vicinity, the fire was extinguished and the Prisoner taken to the hospital.  While still on the ground near the car, there was a conversation between Sergeant Barnes and the Prisoner which included the following:-
Sgt Barnes Why did you do it?
Prisoner I didn't mean to.
Sgt Barnes Why did you kill the girl?
Prisoner It wasn't meant to happen like that.  After I did my dad, I went over there to get an alibi and things got out of hand.  I panicked.  Then the knife was in my hand and I just started slashing.
Sgt Barnes Why did you go back there?
Prisoner I didn't go back.
Sgt Barnes What do you mean?
Prisoner After I finished with dad I went over there.
20In evidence were a number of statements the Prisoner had made to other persons, Dr Tahtouh at Liverpool Hospital on 20 December 2009, Nurse Owens at Long Bay Gaol on 19 February 2010, Dr Goh, a Psychiatric Registrar on 20 February 2010 and later to other psychiatrists.  
21Dr Tahtouh's evidence was that after referring to the incident with his father, the Prisoner went on to say words to the effect that he then decided he needed money and went next door looking for money because he did not have any, the little girl screamed and ran past him and he used the knife on her.  Nurse Owens said that in the course of his interview with the Prisoner the latter said he was aware he was charged and then said, ""Knock him down, knocked down two.  Seriously hurt another"".  The Prisoner said he moved to live with his parents Christmas 2009 but didn't get along with his father, they fought all the time and that his Dad didn't like or want his dog to stay.  The Prisoner ended up having a big fight with his father and the incident happened.  The Prisoner went on to say words to the effect that he then decided he needed money and went next door looking for money because he didn't have any.  He said the little girl screamed and ran past him and he used the knife on her.  He said words to the effect, ""Didn't want to kill her and then seriously hurt the other one, the grandma.  Didn't want to do it, feels bad"".
22Dr Goh said that after referring to the stabbing of his father, the Prisoner mentioned a girl and said that he thought he would go to the neighbour's house, pretend that a home invasion had occurred there, take money from the house and then leave the city.  According to Dr Goh, the Prisoner then said the girl ran past him when he was holding the knife and he was really sorry it happened.
23Dr Nielssen was the first of the psychiatrists who gave evidence at the trial to whom the Prisoner spoke.  According to Dr Nielssen, the Prisoner, after referring to taking his father's body to the shops, said he called on the house and neighbours about 15 minutes later in order to ""create an alibi"", but that he thought he had been followed to the house having noticed a blue car turn into the street which he believed contained people who were after him.  The Prisoner told Dr Nielssen that he pushed his way into the house to avoid being seen.  The Prisoner saw Dr Nielssen on 17 March 2011.
24The next psychiatrist to whom the Prisoner spoke was Dr Allnutt on 23 June 2011 and later on 22 September 2011.  I have set out above the significant parts of the Prisoner's account to Dr Allnutt.
25The Prisoner was also interviewed by Dr Reutens on 8 May 2012 and he gave her a similar account to that which he had given to Dr Allnutt.
26Combined with the evidence of Mrs Wighton and other soon to be mentioned, these accounts were relied on by the Crown as indicating a degree of rationality on the part of the Prisoner prior to the offences the subject of the second and third counts, rationality that the Crown submitted should lead to the conclusion that at the time of those offences the Prisoner's mental state was such that the mental illness and substantial impairment defences were not established.
27The further evidence consisted in part of some to the effect that a screen door to the garage of the Prisoner's father had been damaged and a computer normally kept in the garage missing.  At Mrs Wighton's, a number of external fly screens were damaged, a mobile phone was stolen and there was quite substantial degree of pulling out of clothes etc. from drawers.  I am satisfied that these matters reflected actions of the Prisoner. 
28The three psychiatrists were called, Dr Allnutt by the Crown and Drs Nielssen and Reutens on behalf of the Prisoner.  Dr Nielssen and Dr Reutens opined that that the Prisoner was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of all three offences, saying that this was a disease of the mind, that it led to a defect of reason and in consequence the Prisoner was not able to reason in a calm and logical way and did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 
29Dr Allnutt also said that at the time he killed his father the Prisoner was suffering from a disease of the mind, that this led to a defect of reason and in consequence he was not able to reason about the wrongfulness of his behaviour with a reasonable degree of sense of composure.  Because the Prisoner thought that by killing his father, he would save his mother he believed that he was doing no wrong.  Dr Allnutt said that the Prisoner's condition was consistent with schizophrenia.
30In the case of the other two offences, in his first report Dr Allnutt was somewhat ambivalent.  However, after interviewing the Prisoner again, Dr Allnutt said that based on the Prisoner's account to him which included being followed to the Wighton residence, Mrs Wighton grabbing the phone and Emma Wighton pushing him from behind, it was reasonable to conclude that he had a defence of mental illness because his disease of the mind caused him to be unable to reason about the matter of the wrongfulness in attacking Emma Wighton with a reasonable degree of sense and composure as a person with a rational mind would.  He said that the matter was marginal in the case of Vivienne Wighton.   
31Dr Allnutt was then asked to provide a third report based upon assumptions different from those which he seemed to have chosen as the foundation of his second report.  The assumptions newly proposed were:-
1. The Prisoner attended the Wighton house to divert suspicion from himself and by trying to make it appear to be a home invasion.
2. Included in his thinking was to obtain money so he could leave the area and not be arrested in respect of his father.
3. After attacking Mrs and Emma Wighton, he disturbed things in the house to make it appear a home invasion took place.
4. The Prisoner inflicted significant injuries to both victims other than the cutting of their throats, suggestive of the attacks being more than momentary slashing type.
5. The Prisoner did not believe he had been followed to the Wighton residence by persons who had made threats previously, and
6. He did not mistake Emma Wighton for an attacker.
32Dr Allnutt's conclusions were that if the Prisoner was psychotic at the time he killed his father, then he probably was psychotic at the time of the offences the subject of counts 2 and 3 but that a person with psychosis can reason defectively about one situation and not another and under the scenario postulated, it was unlikely the Prisoner's defect of reason was of a nature and severity that it significantly impaired his capacity to know the nature and consequences of his actions when he attacked both Emma and Vivienne Wighton:  Neither of the defences of mental illness and substantial impairment would be available to him. 
33Dr Allnutt went on to postulate three scenarios.  The first was that when the Prisoner entered the Wighton residence, he was intending to deal with whoever was there and in that case it was unlikely that the defences of mental illness or substantial impairment were open.  The second scenario involved the Prisoner attending the house with the intention of diverting suspicion from himself but with no premeditated intention to attack any occupants, that intention only arising in consequence of something that happened in the house.  Dr Allnutt thought that depending upon what happened and the Prisoner's beliefs thereafter, the defences of mental illness and substantial impairment were or might be ""raised"".
34The third scenario was ""on the same factual basis (but the Prisoner's) underlying motive was seeking to avoid further harm to his family by others and (he) thought he would be killed in gaol ... due to delusional beliefs"".  In that situation, the defences of mental illness and substantial impairment were ""less applicable"" but, one may infer, still possible.
35In what I have just said I have summarised Dr Allnutt's conclusions as best I can.  I confess I found much of his evidence in this case and, in particular, that relating to the three scenarios among the least understandable of any evidence from psychiatrists I have ever heard.  It was made no more comprehensible by the fact that the Crown Prosecutor led Dr Allnutt through lengthy reports he had written with little attempt to avoid a large degree of repetition or to provide clear identification of the significance of particular aspects of the evidence.
36In this case the requirement that any findings I make be consistent with the jury's verdict has a particular significance because, as is apparent from what I said during my summing up, I think that the jury's verdict on count 1, at least, is wrong.  (I should make it clear that that remark is not to be taken as a criticism of the jury system generally.  I am a strong proponent of it.  Judges also make mistakes.)
37But be that as it may, I must sentence the Prisoner in accordance with the verdicts.  I am however entitled to take into account my own view of the Prisoner's mental state insofar as that view is not inconsistent with the verdicts.  I have set out above the unanimous opinion of the psychiatrists so far as the first count is concerned and which, at least in part, the jury must have rejected.  It seems to me that if that opinion is not to be accepted, the most likely element not present is that the Prisoner did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  By so expressing the matter, I do not mean to suggest that I should be seeking to divine what the jury was thinking.  It is a case of making up my own mind and I find it impossible to conclude that the psychiatrists were all wrong in their diagnosis that the Prisoner was suffering from a disease of the mind leading to a defect of reason.
38Evidence from the psychiatrists to the effect that the Prisoner appreciated the nature and quality of his physical act leads me to the view that, within the principles of substantial impairment, the Prisoner's capacity to understand events was not substantially impaired.  However, I am satisfied that his capacity to judge whether his actions in the killing of his father were right or wrong was substantially impaired in circumstances contemplated by those principles.  Indeed, when I have regard to the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that the Prisoner's capacity in the respects mentioned was very greatly impaired.
39Furthermore, although the psychiatrists did not say so, I also incline to the view that the Prisoner's capacity to control himself at the time of killing his father was also substantially impaired by his abnormality of mind.
40If as the jury has found, the Prisoner was not, as the law defines it, mentally ill at the times of his attacks on Emma and Mrs Wighton, the matters I have mentioned argue for the same conclusion as to the Prisoner's capacity at the time of the offences against these two.  However, the jury's verdicts preclude an identical finding.  
41In the case of Emma and Mrs Wighton, it is necessary that I address the issue of the Prisoner's attendance at the Wighton residence.  I should say immediately that given the lack of precision in Dr Allnutt's evidence, I do not regard it as necessarily implicit in the jury's verdicts on counts 2 and 3 that the Prisoner had an intention to attack the occupants of the Wighton residence prior to Mrs Wighton's attendance at the front door.  Indeed I do not regard the jury's verdicts as determinative of any individual one of what I may call the subsidiary evidentiary matters such as those set out in [31] above.  I feel free to reach my own conclusions on those matters.  
42Statements in the note the Prisoner handed to staff at the Emergency Department of Fairfield Hospital and to Sergeant Barnes were both made at a time and in circumstances where deliberate fabrication was so unlikely that the possibility may be discarded.  Both lead inevitably to the conclusion that his attendance at the Wighton premises was deliberate.
43Why he went is by no means as clear.  In the note he said he was looking to create a diversion and was intending to only threaten.  To Sergeant Barnes he mentioned it was to get an alibi.  How, even in the warped or irrational state of mind the Prisoner must have been in at the time he could have thought that threatening the neighbours could have helped him is impossible to understand.  Nor can one readily see how attacking or killing them could have created a diversion that any rational mind could have thought would have been of any possible benefit.  When one adds to these considerations the fact that, prior to that day, the Prisoner had lived for some 45 years and, as the evidence showed, never exhibited or threatened violence, I find it impossible to believe that the Prisoner attended the Wighton residence with any premeditated intention to attack or kill.
44At least in concept, obtaining an alibi does have a degree of rationality about it, although the same cannot be said for the alibi attempt contemplated.  His later statement to Dr Allnut that he was going to say his car broke down and he needed to call his father because this would establish that at the time he rang he did not know his father was dead would be of limited use unless accompanied by a further statement that he had gone to his father's place next door but could not make contact or some explanation as to why he had not gone there.  Furthermore, the fact that, according to his mother's statement, the front door was unlocked when she arrived home at about 11.50 to 12 o'clock was liable to complicate some such alibis. 
45Absent some premeditated intention to attack whoever happened to be in the Wighton residence, the most likely explanation for Prisoner's wrenching open of the screen door seems to be that he believed that he was being followed and wished to get inside before being seen by those he believed to be following although the fact that the first time he mentioned being followed or a blue car was when he saw Dr Nielssen on 17 March 2011 gives the suggestion appreciably less weight than if these matters had been mentioned earlier.
46His sidling down the hallway with his back to the staircase, the side of which was filled in, is strongly suggestive of wariness or fear but it is difficult to see any logic in his attack on Mrs Wighton as soon as they reached the kitchen unless his idea of a  ""diversion"" included attacking or killing anyone who happened to be in the house at the time he want there.  Obviously the fact of that attack occurring as soon as it did raises the question whether it was premeditated but even after bringing it into the equation, I still cannot see how he could have thought before arriving at the Wighton premises that an attack on its occupants would have been of any benefit.
47His cutting the throats of Mrs Wighton and Emma might have been a response to a recognition that after he attacked Mrs Wighton he was in serious trouble, but otherwise these actions seem to have no logical explanation unless the Prisoner felt under attack himself.  The nature of those actions is also so awful that it argues, particularly in light of the Prisoner's non-violent past, for something having gone badly awry in his mental processes.
48I do not forget the signs of a home invasion of some sort, signs I am satisfied were left by the Prisoner.  At least some of the emptying of drawers may have been in the search for money but the damage to the flyscreens outside seems definitely to be a pretence.  There was clearly some rationality, even if imperfect, in these actions.  But even taking these matters into account I remain persuaded that the Prisoner's attacks on Mrs Wighton and Emma were not premeditated and reflected some substantial mental aberration.  It may be that that was contributed to by the psychotic state which, according to Dr Allnutt, would have continued after the killing of his father.  It may be that it was contributed to by some belief, perhaps provoked by Emma running past or otherwise responding to the attack on Mrs Wighton, of he himself being attacked by those involved in his delusions but we will never know and in any event I do not need to decide.     
49I should record also that I do not ignore the Prisoner's other explanations such as seeking to obtain money for his attendance on the Wighton premises, whether he had such intentions before going there I do not know but in any event I am satisfied they provide no rational or logical explanation for his attack on Emma and Mrs Wighton and I am certainly not persuaded they were his motivation for those attacks.  So far as the issues arising in the mental illness defence are concerned, I am satisfied that at the time the Prisoner had a defect of reason arising from a disease of the mind.  Those conclusions mean that I am precluded from finding that he either did not appreciate the nature and quality of his acts or know they were wrong. 
50So far as the substantial impairment defence is concerned, I am satisfied that at the time of his attacks on Mrs Wighton and Emma, the Prisoner's capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition.  The combination of these findings and the jury's verdict forces me to the conclusion that the degree of impairment was not so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  So expressed of course, my view does not relate directly to the attempted murder of Mrs Wighton to which the defence of substantial impairment cannot, by law, apply.
51Subject to those reservations, I am both entitled and obliged to take into account in sentencing the Prisoner his mental state as I have found it to be. 
52Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence the Court take into account a number of aggravating and mitigating features if they are known to the court.  The Crown submitted that there were a number of aggravating features in this case, viz:-
(i) The extent of violence involved in the three offences.
(ii) The nature of the weapon used on Emma and Vivienne Wighton.
(iii) That the offences against them occurred against the victims in their home.
(iv) Gratuitous cruelty, particularly the patterned injury on Emma Wighton.
(v) The injury, emotional harm and loss involved in all offences was substantial.
(vi) The offences against Emma and Vivienne Wighton involved some planning.
(vii) The offences against Emma and Vivienne Wighton were committed, in part, for financial gain.
53I have dealt sufficiently with the extent of violence in the murders themselves and in the attack on Mrs Wighton.  Obviously, nearly all murders involve some violence.  Clearly, the injury, emotional harm and loss involved in all offences was substantial and the offences did occur in the victims' homes.  It certainly appears that in addition to the knife cuts, both victims were also subjected to a number of blows, probably with a fist but it seems not unlikely that those blows were for the purposes of subduing the victims.  The particular object that caused the patterned injury to which reference was made was not identified but I am not disposed to find, certainly beyond reasonable doubt, that there was gratuitous cruelty.  It follows from what I have said above that I do not regard there as having been any relevant planning of the offences and I am not satisfied that the offences were committed for financial gain. 
54In return, Ms Francis drew attention to a number of mitigating factors.  Some are referred to above.  I turn to others and some subjective matters that seem to me of significance.  Prior to the commission of the subject offences the Prisoner, who was born in February 1964, had no criminal record.  Numerous witnesses said that he had never been violent or threatened violence in the past.  There was no evidence to the contrary and accordingly I accept this testimony.
55For some years prior to the offence the Prisoner had been on a disability pension following a bike accident.  For some of that time he had been living at a property his parents had owned in Queensland.  Over a period of about 5 years the Prisoner worked part time as an employee in a window tinting business.  His employer in that business, Mr Cramp, gave evidence in the trial and said that one couldn't ask for a better employee.  In a reference tendered in the sentencing proceedings Mr Cramp said that the Prisoner was always punctual, reliable, energetic, a true tradesman, honest and respectful.  I accept this evidence.
56Given, inter alia, the terms of the Prisoner's note handed to the Emergency Department and his attempt at suicide, there can be no doubt that the Prisoner is deeply sorry for his offences.  Given these matters and the Prisoner's general attitude and conduct prior to 18 December 2009 and after his arrest but subject to two qualifications, there is in my view no reasonable possibility of his re-offending.  The first qualification is that the Prisoner remain on anti-psychotic medication as long as treating psychiatrists require.  Dr White, a psychiatrist at MRRC whose report was tendered on sentence indicates that the Prisoner should remain on this indefinitely and probably for the rest of his life.  In prison, the Prisoner has always been compliant in this regard and polite and co-operative.  Given his life prior to 18 December 2009, it seems to me likely that he will remain so.
57The second qualification is that the Prisoner remain abstinent from alcohol, marijuana and other drugs.  Dr Nielssen gave evidence which I accept that the most probable cause of the onset of the Prisoner's psychosis was his chronic cannabis use.  (I may perhaps add by way of aside that this evidence accords with a deal that I have heard or read in other cases.  I do not recollect schizophrenia and the resulting horrendous consequences such as occurred in this case being addressed in the recent advocacy of the legalisation or decriminalisation of this drug.)
58The Prisoner's self-immolation merits further mention.  Ms Francis referred to it as demonstrative of remorse but it has a wider significance.  It is clear law that in determining a sentence, a court should take into account any extra curial punishment which an offender has suffered in consequence of his offence - R v Daetz and Wilson (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 at [62].  In this case, although the ""punishment"" was inflicted by the Prisoner upon himself, it is so connected with his offending that it should be counted.  Although the evidence was by no means as complete as it might have been if defence counsel had adverted to the significance of the topic it appears that his burns delayed the Prisoner's arrival at Long Bay until 19 February 2010.  The injuries he suffered included partial to full thickness burns of his entire face and head, partial thickness burns to the rear of his neck, full thickness burns to both hands affecting all digits and up to the wrists, partial thickness burns to both legs as well as a small burst blister on his left buttock.  Observation of him in Court makes it apparent that he has suffered significant disfigurement.  One may take judicial notice of the fact that the injuries would have been accompanied by very severe pain.
59Lest it be thought they have been forgotten, I mention some other matters to which counsel referred.  Section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the Court may impose a lesser penalty when the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence (whether by disclosures made pre-trial or during the trial or otherwise).  During the trial, the only substantial issues were those of mental illness and substantial impairment and matters incidental thereto.  Section 23 provides that the Court may impose a lesser penalty than otherwise if an offender has assisted in the investigation of an offence.  Clearly, the Prisoner did so by his admissions. 
60I see no basis in this case for a finding of special circumstances except for the fact of accumulation of sentences that must occur but that accumulation clearly justifies such a finding.
61I record also that during the sentencing hearing there were read Victim Impact Statements by Jeremy Decker, the brother of Emma Wighton and by Vivienne Wighton.  In the main, that last-mentioned statement related to the death of Emma, though also touched upon what had happened to Mrs Wighton herself.  In accordance with the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and the numerous cases that have followed it, there are significant limits to which statements relating to a murder victim can be put but the statements do go to bring home the terrible impact which the offences committed by the Prisoner have, not only on primary victims, but also on family members.
62The maximum penalty provided for in the Crimes Act for murder is life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty provided for manslaughter and for causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder is in both cases imprisonment for 25 years.  Section 54A et seq. of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides a standard non-parole period for the murder of a child under 18 of 25 years, and for causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder of 10 years.  Such periods are to be set unless the court determines upon a different period on grounds referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
63Section 61 of that last mentioned Act provides that:-
(1)  A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.
64The Crown submitted that it was open to me to find that the murder of Emma Wighton fulfilled the requirements of this section but in light of the findings I have made above, it clearly is not.  
65The purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence are set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but it is sufficient for present purposes if I use the formulation in Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 - ""protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform"".  Relevant also in this case is the fact that the Prisoner's offending was in large part a consequence of his abnormal mental state.  In Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54] a majority of the High Court recently said (omitting most references):-
One purpose of sentencing is to deter others who might be minded to offend as the offender has done. Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this - R v Mooney (Unreported, Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 June 1978 at 5); cited in R v Anderson [1981] Vic Rp 17; [1981] VR 155 at 160.
""General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.""
In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way:
""[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.""
The principle is well recognised. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community. 
66Obviously the situation of the Prisoner is not on all fours with those of whom the High Court was speaking but there are many similarities.  A significant reduction in mental capacity both reduces the moral culpability of an offender and renders him largely inappropriate as an example for general deterrence.  It may lead to the view also that little punishment is needed by way of personal deterrence; conversely, it may in an appropriate case lead to greater weight being given to the protection of the community.  It may also make an offender's time in prison more burdensome although I have seen nothing to suggest that that will be so in this case. 
67In the case of the Prisoner, because of my assessment of him and what I see as to the significance of his schizophrenia, I think that general deterrence should be given little weight.  (The High Court in Muldrock v The Queen was content to accept the trial judge's view that general deterrence had no weight.)   For the same reasons, and because the Prisoner's self-immolation is the clearest possible evidence of his remorse, I take the same view of personal deterrence.  I do not think that any further substantial time in custody will further the Prisoner's reform or rehabilitation and I do not see that the protection of the community requires he be kept there longer than for his treating doctors to be satisfied that he will continue to take his medications and abstain from illegal drugs and alcohol.  In his case it is only retribution that justifies any further substantial time in custody.  It may well be that in light of these remarks, the sentences I intend to impose are too harsh but I feel constrained by past sentencing patterns, and more particularly the sentences reflected in those patterns, to not be more lenient.  
68Under principles of sentencing established now for well over a century, maximum penalties are only imposed in circumstances that can be regarded as falling within a ""worst case"" and a judge is required to make some assessment where in a scale a particular offence falls.  To the layman, particularly in the case of murder where, by definition, the victim has died it may seem strange that the law differentiates one such offence from another but experience shows that there are large differences between offences of murder.  Premeditation, the infliction of suffering going beyond that necessarily involved in the offence and whether there was an intent to kill rather than merely inflict grievous bodily harm are but three of the myriad of factors that go to differentiate one case of murder from another.  Nothing the Court can do can bring back the life that has been lost but for many decades now the law has ceased to require a life for a life, or to say that all murderers should be imprisoned for the rest of their lives.  
69As Howie J eloquently expressed it in R v Zaro [2007] NSWSC 756:-
50  The sentencing of a murderer such as the offender can never settle the score as it were. One often hears complaints that the sentence did not represent the value of the life of the deceased. But it never can. How does one value the life of a young man in the eyes of his family and friends? Retribution is only one of the many aspects of punishment even though it is a very significant one when the court is dealing with an offence where a human life has been taken. The Court understands and sympathises with the loss occasioned to the deceased's friends and family. But it cannot hope to replicate that in the punishment it inflicts on another young man and does not attempt to do so. I cannot impose a longer sentence because of the effect on others of the death of the deceased. 
51  I can only ask those who grieve for the deceased to understand that the Court does not set out to destroy another young life in retaliation for what he has done even though it was a heartless, wicked and selfish act. I am conscious that however long the offender spends in prison he will still be able eventually to grow old in the community amongst his family and friends, an experience denied by him to the deceased. The Court can only endeavour to ensure that when he is released he can repay some of his debt by being then a worthwhile member of the community. 
70I turn then to the sentences that should be imposed.  There is no clear tariff for manslaughter offences, particularly those committed under the influence of an abnormality of mind.  It is implicit in the expressions ""substantially impaired"" and ""impairment ... so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"" that there will be variations of degree.  Some impairment may be gross, some may only just fall within the description of ""substantial"" so as to warrant the reduction.  What I have said demonstrates that the Prisoner's abnormality of mind was very high on the scale.  There are, of course, also the other factors to which I have referred to be taken into account.
71The sentence for the manslaughter of Gervasio Da-Pra should be for a total term of 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 
72I am, of course, well aware of the Judicial Commission Sentencing Statistics for murder and for the offence against Emma.  I have referred to the terms of s 54A et seq of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  What I have said makes clear that there are reasons for setting non-parole periods that are shorter than the standard non-parole periods for these offences.  Bearing in mind the significance of his schizophrenia to the Prisoner's offending, the sentence for the murder of Emma Wighton should also be substantially less than it would otherwise have been, particularly as there is nothing to suggest that prior to his offending the Prisoner ever consciously realised the mental state he was in or what his drug taking might lead to.  His self-immolation argues for further reduction.  Both of these matters are encompassed within s 21A(1).  The sentence for the murder of Emma Wighton should be of imprisonment for a total of 15 years including a non-parole period of 10 years.
73Bearing in mind the difference in maximum penalties provided the sentence for causing grievous bodily harm to Vivienne Wighton with intent to murder her should be for a total of 6 years and include a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
74The severity of a sentence of imprisonment is not simply proportional to its length.  Given the likely impact on an offender's life, imprisonment for 10 years is more than twice as severe as imprisonment for 5 years.  Furthermore, the principle of totality requires that the sentences I have announced be not simply added but be made at least partly concurrent.  In totality they will involve a non-parole period of 15 years.  The result of the orders I make are as follows:-
(i) For the manslaughter of Gervasio Da-Pra, I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 20 December 2009 together with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 20 June 2014;
(ii) For causing grievous bodily harm to Vivienne Wighton with intent to murder her, I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 20 December 2012 together with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 20 June 2017;  
(iii) For the murder of Emma Wighton, I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 20 December 2014 together with a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 20 December 2024;  
(iv) I record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that you shall first become eligible for parole, 20 December 2024.

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hislop J.

2BLANCH J: I agree with the conclusion reached by Justice Hislop that the applicant has not demonstrated the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable or were not supported by the evidence or that there has been a miscarriage of justice and I agree with the orders he proposes. Having reviewed the evidence of Mr Roberts, Ms Papafilopoulos and Mr Federico I have formed an assessment of their evidence that it is compelling and although they might be criticised for earlier untruths, I believe their evidence proves the guilt of the applicant beyond a reasonable doubt. 

3HISLOP J:

Introduction

The applicant was charged on indictment on the following counts:

""1. Between 4 November 2004 and 30 November 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, he did cause Christopher Roberts to make a written statement containing a false description of events with the intent thereby to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 Crimes Act 1900.

2. Between 4 November 2004 and 30 November 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, he did cause Betty Papafilopoulos to make a written statement containing a false description of events with the intent thereby to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 Crimes Act 1900.

Outline facts

7Mr Casserly was at Central Railway Station with his friends, Messrs Kite and McNamara, at about 8.00am on Sunday 12 September 2004. He and his friends were taking a shortcut from one part of the station to another and went through the ticket barriers. Mr Casserly had a return train ticket but was aware that neither of his friends had tickets. They were approached by Uniformed Transit Officers Federico and Papafilopoulos and asked to show their tickets. They did not do so. A dispute arose between Mr Casserly and the officers.

8The applicant was the chief transit officer with the security division of Railcorp NSW. He was responsible for directing, initiating and supervising the operation of his team, which included transit officers Federico, Papafilopoulos and Roberts.

9On 12 September 2004 the applicant was rostered from 6.00am to 2.00pm. He was paired with Mr Roberts and they were both in plain clothes, patrolling the country platform at Central Railway Station. Shortly after 8.00am the applicant heard what sounded like people arguing coming from the direction of the escalators. He and Mr Roberts walked over and saw Ms Papafilopoulos and Mr Federico at the bottom of the escalators with the three young men.

10The applicant approached the group. An altercation ensued in which, inter alia, Mr Casserly was brought to the ground by the applicant and handcuffed. 

11Mr Casserly was released later whereupon he attended at a police station and subsequently lodged a complaint against the applicant. On 9 November 2004 a court attendance notice issued charging the applicant with the assault of Mr Casserly. That charge was heard in the Local Court on 17 March 2005. The applicant was convicted of common assault. The conviction was overturned on appeal to the District Court.

12It was the Crown case at trial that the applicant was aware that Mr Casserly may make a complaint to police about his treatment. In consequence of that possibility, the applicant prevailed upon Ms Papafilopoulos, Mr Roberts and Mr Federico to make statements or notebook entries that contained descriptions of events which were false in a material particular. He further prevailed upon Ms Papafilopoulos and Mr Federico to give false evidence at the Local Court proceedings brought against him.

13Each of the counts required the Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a false description of events which the applicant knew to be false. Central to the case were allegations that Mr Casserly had ""shoulder barged"" the applicant and that Mr Casserly made reference to a knife.

14A number of witnesses were called in the Crown case. They included, principally, Messrs Casserly, Kite, Roberts, Federico, O'Rourke and Ms Papafilopoulos. Mr McNamara was not called. The applicant also gave evidence.

The evidence
Mr Casserly

15Mr Casserly gave evidence that the applicant approached him. He did not produce any identification but he and Mr Roberts introduced themselves as City Rail staff. Mr Casserly denied the applicant showed him his badge at the time. The applicant asked Mr Casserly ""Where's your ticket?"". Mr Casserly said he and his friends had not done anything wrong. He was then grabbed by the applicant and thrown to the ground by him and Mr Roberts. Mr Casserly's wrist was pulled up against his back and he called out to Mr McNamara to call his father. Mr Casserly said he wanted the police to attend but the applicant laughed and said ""The police will not be coming"". Mr Casserly was told he would be let up if he calmed down, so he calmed down because the pain was quite bad. He was allowed to get up but after complaining about his treatment was shoved against a wall. He denied he was swept to the floor.

16Mr Casserly said he ultimately produced his train ticket to the applicant and was issued fines. The penalty notices related to not making his ticket available for inspection, using offensive language and refusing to comply with a requirement of an authorised officer. Mr Casserly denied using the words attributed to him in the penalty notice namely ""haven't got a fuckin ticket, don't need a fuckin ticket, not showing you shit. I'm not hopping on a train so fuck off. If you come next to me I'll fuckin slash you"". Mr Casserly told the officers ""We are not catching a train so get lost"" and ""If you touch me I will react"". He denied saying anything about a knife or threatening to ""slash"" anybody. He denied shoulder barging or lunging the applicant. His father was not a police officer and he denied claiming he was. The only time he swore was after being subjected to excessive force. 

17Mr Casserly told the officers, including the applicant, that he was going straight to the police station about this matter. He may well had added ""I'm going to have your job"". The applicant laughed and said ""Go for it"". 

18Mr Casserly agreed in cross-examination that he had been drinking the night before and that his last drink would have been at about 5.00am. However, he did not feel intoxicated when he got to Central Railway Station; ""just felt tired"". He agreed the applicant went through his wallet and found his train ticket while he was still handcuffed. He could not recall the applicant saying ""You're under arrest for not complying. Do you have anything on you that could harm me?"". He denied replying ""Yeah a fucking knife"" or that the applicant said ""Where's the knife?"" to which he responded ""I was fucking joking. I don't have it"".

Mr Kite

19Mr Kite gave evidence that Mr Casserly was handled roughly by the applicant who pushed him against the glass and had him on the ground. He could not recall any reference to a knife. Mr Casserly said he wanted police officers to attend. He could not recall if Mr Casserly swore during the incident but thought ""there would have been"" swearing. He was ""intoxicated but not overly intoxicated"".

Mr O'Rourke

20Mr O'Rourke was a State Rail customer service attendant at the time of the incident. He did not know the applicant, Ms Papafilopoulos or Mr Federico. He could recall the name of Christopher Roberts. He did not know Mr Casserly. He was working at the relevant time. He saw uniformed transit officers speaking to Mr Casserly who looked a bit stand-offish and was patting himself on the chest on his pockets. He then saw a man in a red shirt (the applicant) ""come up and take over the situation"", ""being aggressive towards [Mr Casserly]"". He did not see the applicant identify himself by presenting his badge and could not hear what was said. In cross examination he agreed he heard the applicant say ""I am a senior transit officer."" The voices got louder and he heard the applicant say words to the effect of ""Stand there or you'll be placed under arrest."" Mr Casserly tried to leave and the applicant grabbed his shirt and pushed him up against a glass partition. Mr O'Rourke did not see anything to cause the applicant to do what he did. The applicant then tried to handcuff Mr Casserly and he was resisting so he was pushed to the ground. Mr Casserly yelled out and grimaced in pain. He was handcuffed and brought to his feet, then began to yell that he was being attacked and asked that the officers call the police. The officers laughed and said they were not going to call the police. Mr Casserly asked his friend to call his father. He was released after about ten minutes. Mr O'Rourke had no discussion with Mr Casserly and saw him walk away.

Mr Roberts

21Mr Roberts in his evidence said he did not hear either Mr Casserly or the applicant say anything about a knife. At no stage did Mr Casserly threaten to cut or slash anyone. 

22Following the incident Mr Roberts accompanied the applicant to the Transit Office where the applicant made an occurrence pad entry in which he stated, inter alia, ""...asking if the POI had any weapons on his person. He stated that he had a knife. CTO Cottrell then searched the POI and found no weapons. POI then stated he was only joking regarding the knife. POI's details were obtained and three infringement notices were issued. POI was then released and left the station."" Mr Roberts read the entry and asked why there was reference to a conversation about a knife. The applicant said it was to justify the search. Mr Roberts said it did not happen. He did not think the applicant replied. The occurrence pad entry did not refer to any shoulder barge.

23The first time Mr Roberts heard any mention of the knife was when the applicant prepared the occurrence pad entry. Mr Roberts denied that he answered in the affirmative when asked if anyone heard Mr Casserly say he had a knife.

24Mr Roberts said that Mr Casserly did push into the applicant a few times while he was handcuffed and Mr Roberts thought he was aggressive and felt he was in danger. He said Mr Casserly used offensive language.

25The applicant telephoned him two or three days before 5 November 2004 stating that he (Roberts) had to make a statement and include the conversation regarding the knife. Telephone charge records of calls from the applicant to Mr Roberts on 2,3,4 and 5 November 2004 were produced though Mr Roberts did not recall the content of the calls. Mr Roberts was then requested by David Carroll (SRA manager) to attend at Central Railway Station. In response, on 5 November 2004 Mr Roberts went to an office on Platform 1 at Central Railway Station with Ms Papafilopoulos. The applicant entered the office while they were there. Mr Roberts thought he saw the applicant sitting at Ms Papafilopoulos' computer. The applicant read his statement as he was typing it and commented on some changes some of which Mr Roberts typed in and others which were included by the applicant.

26The statement was dated 5 November 2004 and was given to the investigating police.

27The statement of Mr Roberts referred to in Count 1 is the statement dated 5 November 2004. It contains the following:

""8 Then [Mr Casserly] said to Federico 'Get out of my way or I'm going to fucken smash you cunt'. At this point Cottrell and myself identified ourselves as transit officers by showing our badges and our identification.

9 Casserly said 'Fuck off. I will slash you cunts too'. 

10 I said 'He may have a knife'. 

11 Cottrell said 'Calm down just calm down, show me your hands'.

12 Casserly said 'Fuck off or I will cut you open'.

...

18 Cottrell said 'do you have anything on you that is dangerous and could harm us'. 

19 Casserly said 'A fucking knife'.

20 Cottrell proceeded to search Casserly and placed his personal items a wallet and a phone in front of him.

21 No knife was found.

22 Casserly said 'I was joking about the knife'.

...

31 Casserly pushed forward into CTO Cottrell towards Kite. CTO Cottrell then pushed Casserly back, shortly after, Casserly calmed down and Cottrell then removed the handcuffs.

...

35. At the time Casserly threatened to slash me I thought my person was in danger and I did not give permission to threaten me.""

28Mr Roberts gave evidence these comments were false. He said he included them in his statement at the request of the applicant.

29Mr Roberts made a further statement to SRA Transport Complaint Unit investigators (""SRA"") on 26 November 2004 which included false information regarding the knife and an assertion that the applicant did not discuss his statement with him on 5 November 2004. He lied to the investigators because he was told to stick to his earlier statement.

30Mr Roberts gave evidence in the Local Court on 17 March 2005. There he was shown a copy of his statement dated 5 November 2004 and asked whether the contents of the statement were true and correct. When he replied affirmatively he was not telling the truth.

31Mr Roberts said he lied when he was interviewed by Det. Pianta on 1 June 2007. On 10 June 2008 he made a statement under inducement. He agreed that, when he identified the false aspects of his statement of 5 November 2004, he failed to refer to para 35 (""Casserly threatened to slash me"").

32Mr Roberts agreed that the applicant chastised him over an incident at the wedding of Mr Federico but denied that he thereafter bore the applicant a grudge for interfering in his domestic affairs. 

Ms Papafilopoulos

33Ms Papafilopoulos had undertaken a three month induction training course and as at 12 September 2004 was on probation, having worked in uniform for approximately two weeks. She agreed she had signed a probation report on 31 August 2004 and 31 October 2004 and that her permanent appointment was confirmed by letter dated 23 November 2004. She said she did not know her appointment had been confirmed as at 5 November 2004 when she prepared her statement.

34Ms Papafilopoulos gave evidence that after the incident there was a discussion between her, Mr Federico, Mr Roberts and the applicant. The applicant said ""You heard him say he had a knife"". Ms Papafilopoulos said ""No"" but Mr Federico and Mr Roberts said ""Yeah"" and appeared to go along with it.

35About 10-15 minutes after the incident Ms Papafilopoulos and Mr Federico went to a room to write up the incident in their official notebooks. The applicant had not told Ms Papafilopoulos what to put in her notebook. In her notebook entry Ms Papafilopoulos made no reference to a knife or shoulder barge.

36The applicant told Ms Papafilopoulos to prepare a statement and send it to him. She prepared a statement dated 12 September 2004. She attempted to email it to him but the email was recorded as ""Undeliverable"". Telephone records for 3 November 2004 indicate a call made by Ms Papafilopoulos to the applicant though Ms Papafilopoulos could not remember the call.

37On 5 November 2004 Ms Papafilopoulos was told by Mr Roberts that David Carroll wanted Mr Roberts and Ms Papafilopoulos to prepare statements in an office on platform one at Central Railway Station. She attended as requested and spent an hour or two writing her statement. When she completed her statement, the applicant helped her print it out, took the statement from the printer and made changes to it on the computer Ms Papafilopoulos had been using. At one point the applicant said ""You heard him say he had a knife didn't you?"", to which Ms Papafilopoulos replied ""No"". Her revised statement was printed out.

38Ms Papafilopoulos had given the revised statement dated 5 November 2004 to the investigating police on that date.

39The revised statement of Ms Papafilopoulos is the statement referred to in Count 2. It contains the following:

"" ... Casserly appeared agitated and looked to me that he had taken some substance apart from alcohol.

10 Casserly was still raising his voice and being aggressive and still seemed to be agitated. While I was dealing with POI Number 3 I returned my attention to Casserly, Chief Cottrell and Officer Roberts. I saw Casserly push into Chief Cottrell a couple of times and Chief Cottrell pushed him back out of his personal space"".

40Ms Papafilopoulos gave evidence that these comments did not accurately reflect her memory of the events and were false. 

41The incident was subsequently investigated by SRA. The applicant told Ms Papafilopoulos that if asked whether she had spoken to him by telephone or had emailed him to say no and to stick to the truth, the truth being her statement dated 5 November 2004. Ms Papafilopoulos was interviewed by SRA investigators on 25 November 2004. A statement from that interview was provided to her for review and she gave it to the applicant so he could make changes to it. The applicant told her not to tell anyone she had given him the document to review. She agreed that she had included information in her first statement which was not in her notebook and which were not matters she was told to include by the applicant but based on her memory of the incident.

42She gave evidence in the Local Court in relation to a charge of assault against the applicant on 17 March 2005. The applicant spoke to her about the hearing many times before that date, always telling her to stick to the truth which truth was the statement. Ms Papafilopoulos gave evidence in accordance with her statement of 5 November 2004. The evidence she gave which was not truthful was that the applicant showed his badge after introducing himself to Mr Casserly, Mr Casserly pushed into or shoulder barged/charged the applicant a couple of times. The applicant had told her to give this false evidence.

43Ms Papafilopoulos was interviewed by Det. Pianta on 1 and 19 June 2007 and maintained that her earlier statements were truthful. She signed a statement to that effect on 16 August 2007. This was untrue. She was reinterviewed by Det. Pianta on 22 May 2008 and gave truthful information. She was subsequently interviewed by SRA and in that interview stated ""Mentally I'm everywhere due to the fact I don't know the truth. I don't know the lies. I don't know what I saw. I'm totally confused."" This was due to her depression and anxiety.

44Ms Papafilopoulos agreed that she had lied about what had occurred on 12 September 2004 many times but maintained she was now telling the truth. 

Mr Federico

45Mr Federico had been employed as a transit officer for approximately 12 months as at 12 September 2004.

46He observed the applicant perform a leg sweep taking Mr Casserly to the ground and the applicant and Mr Roberts handcuffing Mr Casserly. Just prior to that Mr Federico did not see any gesture by Mr Casserly towards the applicant and his hands were either down by his side or in his pockets. Mr Federico said he did not see Mr Casserly do anything which made it necessary for the applicant to take him to the ground.

47A notebook entry completed by Mr Federico on 13 September 2004 is the subject of Count 3.

48The notebook contains the following entry:

""... POI shoulder barges Chris (Chief) twice. ... He pushed Chris with his shoulder ... Chris asked if he had anything on him that he shouldn't and he states that he has a knife. POI searched. No knife...""

49Mr Federico gave evidence the entry was false. He said it was made at the request of the applicant. There was a debrief meeting after the incident in which the applicant told Mr Federico what to put in his notebook. Specifically, the applicant told Mr Federico to state that the applicant had shown Mr Casserly his badge and that Mr Casserly had shoulder barged him. Mr Federico had seen neither of these events. The applicant also told Mr Federico to say that he heard Mr Casserly say that he had a knife. Mr Federico had not heard Mr Casserly say this. 

50Mr Federico next saw the applicant at a debrief with Ms Papafilopoulos and Mr Roberts when the applicant went over the matters to be recorded in their notebooks: his badge being produced, Mr Casserly's aggression, that Mr Casserly had a knife, then said he was only joking when no knife was found. Telephone call records indicated Mr Federico had spoken with the applicant between 12 September 2004 and 4 November 2004 including a lengthy 16 minute call. Mr Federico could not remember that call but it was at a time when he was on annual leave.

51Mr Federico was contacted by David Carroll and told he was required to make a statement about the incident. In the statement Mr Federico recounted:

""do you have anything on you that could harm anyone here? Casserly said: Yeah, I have a knife! I saw Cotterill then search Casserly, but no knife was found. In the search Casserly's wallet was taken out of his pocket and placed on the ground in front of him. I heard Cotterill say: 'Where is the knife' Casserly said 'I was only joking'.""

52In cross examination he agreed the applicant said ""Where is the knife?"". He had initially agreed with the applicant when asked whether he heard Mr Casserly say he had a knife but said that was because he had confused that with the applicant's question about a knife. He agreed that Mr Casserly made general threats of assault against the officers.

53Mr Federico was interviewed by SRA on 25 November 2004. He said he had been threatened with losing his job if he did not back up the applicant. 

54Mr Federico said that he had given evidence in the Local Court proceedings on 17 March 2005 in accordance with the note book entry. He had been told to lie in the court by the applicant and also other people in management.

55Mr Federico was interviewed by Det. Pianta on 13 December 2007 and provided a statement under inducement. He agreed he did this to avoid the risk of being prosecuted for perjury but denied he would say anything to save his own skin. He agreed he had never been a truthful witness but maintained that the applicant told him what to put in his notebook and told him to give false evidence in the Local Court proceedings.

CCTV

56Some aspects of the incident were captured on CCTV, the DVD of which was tendered in evidence. At the request of the parties, the Court has viewed the DVD. It depicts the initial physical contact between the applicant and Mr Casserly but thereafter much of the physical contact between Mr Casserly, the applicant and Mr Roberts is wholly or partially out of screen though the persons who were involved otherwise are shown in the DVD. It is noted that the applicant was a burly, thick-set man, as were the other male transit officers. Mr Casserly and his companions were of relatively slight build. No reason for the applicant's aggression toward Mr Casserly is apparent from the footage. After Mr Casserly had departed, the applicant remained at the scene talking to transit officers. There was no soundtrack for any part of the DVD.

The applicant

57The applicant gave evidence at the trial. He said that on approaching the group he produced his badge and introduced himself. He suggested they move and discuss things to which Mr Casserly replied ""Don't touch me or I'll smash you"". The applicant put his hand on Mr Casserly's shoulder and started moving him toward the barrier. Mr Casserly said ""Don't touch me or I'll slash you"". Mr Roberts said he may have a knife. The applicant told Mr Casserly to take his hands out of his pockets and pushed him to the side a bit more firmly upon which Mr Casserly said ""Don't touch me or I'll slice you open"". The applicant grabbed the front of Mr Casserly's shirt and pushed him back toward a wall, then brought him to the ground with a leg sweep. The applicant got the handcuff around one wrist and Mr Roberts assisted in getting it around the other wrist. The applicant told Mr Casserly he was under arrest for failing to comply with the requirements of an authorised officer and asked if Mr Casserly had anything on him that could harm him. Mr Casserly said he had a knife so he patted him down but could not feel anything. The applicant asked ""Where's the knife?"". Mr Casserly said ""I was only joking"". Mr Casserly was brought to his feet and the applicant said ""You shouldn't make jokes about knives"". The applicant told Mr Casserly to calm down. The applicant took Mr Casserly's wallet from his pocket. He gave his driver's licence and train ticket to Mr Federico. Mr Casserly calmed down and the handcuffs were removed. Mr Federico said the penalty notices would be posted to him but Mr Casserly said he wanted them immediately. He received one, said he was going to the police, and left. 

58The applicant initially denied stating during a debrief ""You heard him say he had a knife"". Ultimately in re-examination, the applicant told the court that he had asked at the final debrief if anyone had heard Mr Casserly say he had a knife because that information was required for the Incident Management Package and Occupational Health and Safety issues.

59The applicant denied that Mr Casserly asked them to call police and denied that he responded by laughing and saying that he wasn't going to call the police. In cross-examination he said he did not hear Mr Casserly ask for the police or his father to be called. 

60The applicant said he had never altered, or caused to be altered, any officer's statement, and had not had any discussions with officers about their evidence to be given at the Local Court hearing other than to tell the truth.

Directions

61The jury was addressed in detail by counsel. The jury received appropriate and detailed directions from the presiding judge as to matters appertaining to the assessment of the witnesses and their evidence. His Honour gave warnings pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 in respect of the principal Crown witnesses and referred to the s 128 certificates issued to them. He informed the jury that reliance was placed upon induced statements but that the effect of those statements was limited and provided no protection against charges of perjury in the subject proceedings. The applicant did not contend that his Honour erred in any way in his directions to the jury. 

Leave
62As the sole ground of appeal against conviction does not involve a question of law alone, the applicant requires leave to appeal against conviction: s 5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [12]. Having regard to the arguments advanced at the hearing, I would grant leave to appeal against conviction.

Specific contentions

63The applicant contended it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the assertion by Ms Papafilopoulos that ""I saw Casserly push into Chief Cottrell a couple of times and Chief Cottrell pushed him back out of his personal space"" was false. The contention was based on the evidence of Mr Roberts that he thought there was ""a bit of shoving"" by Mr Casserly, ""it was sort of coming towards Chris. Into like his personal space. So Mr Cottrell pushed him back, I think it was pushing a few times so yeah, at some stage he did make contact with Mr Cottrell a few times if I can recall"" and a concession by the Crown that Mr Casserly ""left open"" whether or not he made a move which could be interpreted as a shoulder barge.

64I do not accept this submission. Ms Papafilopoulos was unshaken in her evidence that she did not see Mr Casserly push or shoulder barge the applicant. There was no reference to such a matter in her notebook or in her statement dated 5 November 2004 until amended by the applicant. The applicant did not originally mention a shoulder barge, Mr Casserly denied any shoulder barge of the applicant. The evidence of Mr Roberts and the alleged concession by Mr Casserly may well be thought by a jury to have little or no weight. The question was not whether or not Mr Casserly had pushed or shoulder barged the applicant, though a negative answer to that question was open and would be sufficient. The question was whether the applicant knew that Ms Papafilopoulos had not witnessed such conduct but nevertheless prevailed upon her to assert that she had.

65The applicant contended there were two initial aspects of the evidence which supported the conclusion that Mr Casserly in fact mentioned a knife and in consequence the jury should have had a doubt and acquitted the applicant of Counts 1, 3 and 5.

66The two aspects were:

(a) Mr Federico gave evidence he heard the applicant say ""Where is the knife?"" and there was no other practical precursor for the applicant to have said this;

(b) both Mr Roberts and Mr Federico responded in the affirmative to the statement in the debrief by the applicant ""You heard him say he had a knife"". 

67I do not accept these submissions. As to (a) Mr Federico's evidence at trial was that he heard the applicant say ""Where is the knife?"" but Mr Federico nevertheless maintained that the applicant did not ask Mr Casserly if he had anything harmful on him and Mr Casserly did not say he had a knife. Whether or not Mr Casserly must have said he had a knife for the question to make sense was a matter for the jury. It was not, of itself, indicative that Mr Casserly must have mentioned a knife; it was equally consistent with the applicant seeking to introduce the topic of a knife in the absence of any reference to one by Mr Casserly. In any event, the issue with respect to the knife was not whether the threat was made but whether the applicant knew that Mr Roberts and Mr Federico had not heard any such threat. Establishing that Mr Casserly made no such threat would be sufficient but was not essential.

68As to (b), while the applicant asserted that both Mr Roberts and Mr Federico responded affirmatively when the applicant asked whether anyone heard Mr Casserly say he had a knife, this was the evidence only of Ms Papafilopoulos, not of Mr Roberts or Mr Federico or even of the applicant, and, of course, Mr Casserly denied he said he had a knife.

Determination
69This appeal is, in essence, a challenge to the credibility of the Crown witnesses. It is said Mr Casserly's evidence, that he did not mention a knife and did not shoulder barge the applicant, should be rejected because he untruthfully minimised the extent to which he used bad language or behaved aggressively. It is said the evidence of Ms Papafilopoulos, Mr Federico and Mr Roberts should be rejected because Ms Papafilopoulos and Mr Federico had previously given evidence, under oath, which they knew to be untrue and they and Mr Roberts had lied in written documents and interviews relating to these matters. It is said there was sufficient uncertainty and inconsistency in the evidence to preclude conviction by the jury. Reliance was placed on matters such as witnesses' recollection or lack thereof, the induced statements, the witnesses' health, concerns regarding continuation of employment, motive, domestic situation, and alleged inconsistencies, all of which were said to seriously undermine credibility. The evidence of the Crown witnesses on significant issues is in direct conflict with that of the applicant. It was said that the applicant's evidence should be preferred.

70Reference was made to comments made in respect of the witnesses by the sentencing judge during the course of the sentencing hearing. No trial judge's report was obtained. I attach no weight to the comments of the trial judge - SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [113] and [115].

71Where a Court of Criminal Appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is ""unreasonable"" or such as ""cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"" the question which the Court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (SKA v R at [11]).

72In performing that task the Court of Criminal Appeal is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" (SKA v R at [14]).

73I have made an independent assessment of the evidence and have concluded that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty as charged.

74In answering the question whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty ""the Court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the Court must pay full regard to those considerations"" M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; SKA v R at [45].

75The evaluation of the demeanour of the witness and his or her manner of giving evidence is necessarily a matter for the jury. The jury was best placed to decide upon the credibility or reliability of the witnesses and thus determining the primary facts. The matters raised by the applicant were quintessentially jury questions in respect of which the jury had been appropriately addressed and directed. It is apparent from the guilty verdicts that the Crown case was accepted by the jury and that the applicant was rejected as a witness of truth.

76In my opinion, the applicant has not demonstrated that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable or were not supported by the evidence or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The appropriate orders are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

Orders
77I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted;

2. Appeal dismissed.

		06 June 2012",2012-06-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708136,Wildsmith v R [2012] NSWCCA 116,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was convicted following a trial of the murder of James Tautari on 27 December 2007. He stood trial along with four co-accused: Luke Tatchell; AC; AA and SS. The applicant and Tatchell were slightly older than 18, the others were slightly younger.
2All of the co-accused were convicted but only the applicant and Tatchell were convicted of murder. The other younger co-accused were acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter.
3The applicant raises two grounds of appeal.
Ground 1: That having regard to the evidence, the verdict of the jury was unreasonable, or cannot be supported; and
Ground 2: That in light of the verdicts of manslaughter for SS, AC and AA the verdict of murder against the applicant is unsustainable. 
4Both grounds of appeal require a detailed consideration of the facts proved at the trial. 
5The deceased had been in a relationship with the mother of AC's girlfriend, AH. The Crown case was that there was a history of domestic violence in the relationship. The Crown asserted that the motive for the assault which ultimately led to the deceased's death was, at least in part, revenge for the deceased's treatment of AH's mother.
6The five offenders, together with three other persons (who ultimately gave evidence for the prosecution) had gathered at the McDonalds restaurant in St Clair. It was Boxing Day and the group had planned to go together to Bent's Basin, a popular swimming hole. AC was driving his car, a Red Nissan Pulsar SSS. AC's girlfriend saw the deceased and pointed him out to some of the group saying something to the effect of ""there's that Jimbo guy."" The Crown alleged that the applicant and SS had a discussion concerning the possibility of an assault on the deceased. After this discussion Tatchell and AC, together with SF, drove to Tatchell's home to obtain some weapons.
7After obtaining the weapons they returned to the McDonalds restaurant where they were joined by another car driven by AC. The two cars, by this time carrying eight people, drove past the deceased on the way to an underpass where they parked and waited for the deceased who was on foot. The weapons were distributed and Tatchell, SS and AA ended up with sticks and a golf club.
8The Crown case was that the youths formed into two groups, the first being Tatchell, AA, SS and the applicant and the second being AC, JR, JM and SF. The Crown alleged that the first group surrounded the deceased and started to hit him. The Crown alleged that Tatchell and SS hit the deceased numerous times.
9In relation to the applicant, the Crown alleged that he sprayed mace ""or similar substance"" when the group had surrounded the applicant on the road and later struck him about the head and body using a weapon. Tatchell was alleged to have struck the deceased in a similar fashion with a metal bar he had brought from his house. SS was alleged to have struck the deceased with the handle of a shovel.
10There were three persons (JR, JM and SF) who, although they were present at McDonalds and came along with the group, were not alleged by the Crown to be participants in the criminal enterprise. They gave evidence. Each of them was cross-examined as to their credit and, in particular, whether or not they were attempting to shift the blame to others to avoid their own criminal liability. 
Ground 1:That having regard to the evidence, the verdict of the jury was unreasonable, or cannot be supported.
11As the High Court recently confirmed in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14], when considering whether or not the verdict of a jury was unreasonable the appellate court is to make its own independent assessment of the evidence both as to sufficiency and quality. The question for the appeal court is one of fact, the appeal court being required to determine whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"": M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492 - 493, quoted in SKA at [14]. Only in circumstances where a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal can be resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence can the Court conclude that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: M at 494 quoted with approval in SKA at [13]. 
12The Crown case alleged that the applicant participated in a joint criminal enterprise. It was alleged that the participants executed an attack on the deceased using weapons to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. In the alternative, the Crown alleged that even if there was no plan to inflict grievous bodily harm, because they knew that weapons would be used in an attack it was within the contemplation of each of the accused that this may occur. The Crown alleged that the applicant, Tatchell, AA and SS actually participated in the attack and that AC was present, ready and willing to assist if necessary.
13With respect to the applicant, the issue at the trial was whether or not he was part of any criminal enterprise to assault the deceased. If the jury found that he was, then the issue was whether, as part of any agreement to which the applicant was party, the infliction of grievous bodily harm was within the contemplation of the applicant as a possible consequence of the agreement. The evidence against the applicant came substantially from SF, JM and JR the persons who, although present, were not charged with any offence.
The available evidence
14There was evidence from CCTV footage of the movements of the group at the McDonalds restaurant. It is plain from that footage that the applicant did not go with Tatchell when he left to obtain the weapons. The applicant does not appear to play any part in the discussion within the group following the identification of the deceased by AC's girlfriend. 
15The CCTV footage also makes plain that the applicant was the last person into the car. He was described by his counsel as a ""reluctant passenger."" This was in support of the submission, which was made at the trial, that the Crown could not prove that the applicant had joined the criminal enterprise (being the plan to assault the deceased) despite the fact that he had decided to go with the others. 
16None of the offenders gave evidence at the trial and only AC was interviewed by the police. Accordingly, the Crown case was contained in the evidence of SF, JM and JR. The applicant submitted that reliance on the evidence of these three witnesses was an unsafe basis for conviction for nine reasons:
(a)There is no evidence independent of the three ""crucial"" witnesses from which the applicant's intention may be inferred;
(b)With respect to each of the three ""crucial"" witnesses, they were aware that if they did not give a statement to police nominating who they said did what, that they themselves would be charged with murder;
(c)Each of the three witnesses lied to police, and/or the Children's Court at committal proceedings, with respect to important aspects of the evidence and their part in the incident;
(d)In addition to admitted lies, each of the witnesses had, at trial, changed their versions of events from the versions they had given to police and/or at committal;
(e)There was an inference that SF and JR had discussed the versions they would give police, could be drawn;
(f)Each of the three important witnesses gave contradictory evidence about the applicant's attitude toward any plan to do something to the deceased;
(g)Each of the witnesses gave significantly differing versions as to what the applicant was alleged to have done at the scene;
(h)There was no evidence available to the Crown as to what the plan was, or indeed when each of the accused were said to have joined; and
(i)There was no objectively verifiable evidence consistent with mace being used. 
17It is apparent (and accepted by the Crown) that at the time SF, JR and JM first cooperated with the police each of them had a concern that they may be charged with the offence. SF said he was informed that he could be charged but he made his statement as he was willing to help. JR made a statement to a solicitor which he understood would be provided to the police. He believed that if he did not cooperate he would be charged with murder. JM indicated that when he returned to make his statement he was told that he could be charged with being an accessory to murder. 
18Each of the witnesses was cross-examined about these circumstances and, accordingly, the veracity of their evidence was able to be assessed by the jury. The jury was also warned in appropriate terms in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995.
19The applicant submitted (Ground 1(c) and 1(d)) that each of the witnesses lied to the police, lied in the Children's Court and gave different versions of their evidence in court. SF admitted that he had lied to the police when spoken to on the roadside on the day of the incident when he denied his involvement. He also admitted that he lied that night when he went with his brother to the police station. When he was taken to contradictory evidence which he had given in the Children's Court he said that he had been confused as it was the first time that he had ever given evidence.
20When first spoken to by the police JM denied that he was present. Later that night he told the police that he was with the others at Bent's Basin but not involved in the assault. He made a further statement to the police on 4 January 2008 in which he lied about how well he knew the applicant and Tatchell. He admitted that he lied to the police in part to protect SS. He also accepted that he had lied when giving evidence to the Children's Court.
21JM mentioned in his statement that the applicant had used Mace on the deceased but admitted that he did not give this evidence in the Children's Court. In those proceedings he said that the applicant punched the deceased. However, at the trial he accepted that this would be a lie. He modified his account saying that he had ""thought the applicant had hit the victim but he only maced him.""
22The applicant submitted in relation to Ground 1(e) that it could be inferred that SF and JR had collaborated by agreeing the account of the relevant events that they would give to the police. This submission was supported by the evidence of four telephone calls between the two of them, on 26 and 27 December 2007. However, only one phone call was of any length and each of them denied discussing with the other what they had told the police.
23The trial judge was careful to direct the jury as to how they should assess the honesty and reliability of a witness' evidence. His Honour stated:
""Let me remind you of two things that I said when you were first empanelled as a jury and add two additional matters. Now, the first matter is something which I did tell you and that is the distinction between honesty and accuracy. Honesty is an attitude to the truth. The issue for you is, is a particular witness doing his or her best to tell you the truth as they know it? Accuracy is an entirely different concept. Accuracy depends upon other matters such as where the witness was standing in relation to certain events; whether they had a good vantage point; whether they are confused; whether they have mixed something up.  All sorts of considerations enter into whether or not someone is giving accurate evidence. 
An honest person may be doing their level best to give you their honest view but they may be completely mistaken. They may be inaccurate. So your task is to make an assessment of each witness. Can they be relied upon to provide accurate evidence? In determining that you can use the impressions that you had of the witness when they gave their evidence; their demeanour; their body language; what you thought of them. You may have regard to the consistency or the inconsistency of their account, and whether or not their story makes sense. You may consider as well whether or not they have some axe to grind or whether they have a reason to distort or embellish or conceal the truth. So that is the first aspect. The distinction between honesty and accuracy and the need to consider both. 
Now the second matter, that in undertaking your evaluation of each witness and the evidence that they have given, you should not look at that witness in isolation. Rather, you should look at that witness in the context of all of the evidence. Does their evidence make sense having regard to other evidence? Is there a confirmation or contradiction of what a witness says provided by other evidence? So that is the second matter.
...
The third matter is that in respect of a witness' testimony it is not an all or nothing situation. You are not bound to accept everything a witness says or reject everything a witness says. You can accept 'this part' and reject 'that part'. You can approach it as it appears appropriate to you. Of course if you thought that a witness was deliberately lying to you or generally unreliable then you may be inclined not to accept anything that witness says, but again, that is a matter for you. It may be that something that witness says makes sense and you do accept. You may feel that his honesty or unreliability is confined to a particular aspect and you may feel that you may safely act on the rest. So that is the third matter."" 
24His Honour clearly set out for the jury the evidence given by each witness and also gave the jury a clear understanding of the basis of the attack by counsel upon each of the witnesses.
25Grounds 1(f), 1(g) and 1(h) concern the evidence given by the three witnesses in relation to the actions of the applicant before and during the assault and the inferences which may be drawn from that evidence as to the applicant's knowledge of the enterprise and his intent. 
26SF gave evidence that when Tatchell proposed amongst the group that ""they were going to do something"" about the victim the applicant said ""no, not today"". SF said that after Tatchell and AC returned from Tatchell's home with weapons Tatchell ""walked up to [the applicant] and told him to get in the vehicle"". SF said that he then heard the applicant say again ""not today"" and ""just... leave it"". SF said that Tatchell then told the applicant ""don't be a pussy"". SF later said that it was Tatchell or the applicant who said this, although he later confirmed that it was not the applicant. 
27SF initially claimed that after Tatchell called the applicant a ""pussy"" the applicant got into the car. However, after viewing CCTV footage he later accepted that the applicant got into the car a short time later. There was no dispute that the applicant entered the car at this later time.
28SF gave an account of the assault. He said that the group went in two cars to the underpass. SF said that one car contained Tatchell, SF, AC and the applicant and the other car contained, SS, AA and JR. SF could not recall who the other passenger of the second car had been. SF said that after the two vehicles had parked and the passengers had gotten out Tatchell ""handed out the objects that he had got [from his home]"". SF said that Tatchell ""gave the golf club to AA, the pick axe handle to SS and held on to the smaller [pole]"". 
29SF described the commencement of the attack:
""Q: What happened next?A: As we come up, the bloke had just walked past the underpass and Luke [Tatchell] had run up and hit him, I think around the side, I'm not sure where. I didn't see where he hit him.
Q: What happened next?A:Then the other boys ran up and [AA] and [SS] - [SS] started hitting him, with Luke [Tatchell], and David [Wildsmith] ran up with something that looked like a pepper spray in his hand and sprayed him.""
30SF said that the spray looked like ""a small black canister with a button on top"". When asked what part of the victim the applicant had sprayed SF said that ""he was standing about a meter away and spraying it on him"". SF said that the victim was standing at the time the spray was used. During cross examination SF said that he saw the spray hit the victim:
""Q. All right then, so when he sprayed this guy with pepper spray and got him on his body and on his face, did you hear the man yell out?A. Yeah, the man was yelling.
Q. From the pepper spray hitting him in the face?A. He was yelling throughout the whole thing.
Q. Did you hear him yell out particularly when this pepper spray supposedly hit this man on the face?A. Like I said, he was yelling throughout the whole thing so, yeah.
Q. So it clearly got him?A. Obviously.
Q. And clearly had an affect, you say, is that right?A. From my point of view yes.
Q. And that is an effect that has been caused by about 4-5 seconds of spray and perhaps another two occasions, yeah?A. Like I said, the man was yelling. From my point of view it looked like it did connect with him.
Q.When you say from your point of view it looked like it connected with him, you told us that you saw it connect with him, haven't you?A. Yes.""
31SF gave evidence about the persons who had hit the victim and the number of times that each person had hit him:
""Q. Now, you described Luke Tatchell hitting him first?A. Yes.
Q. With the metal pole that you described, and then [SS] hitting him second. How many times did Luke Tatchell hit him?A. Throughout the whole thing?
Q. Yes?A. Would have been about 20 times.
Q. You said you saw [SS] hit him before - well I should ask you this - before David Wildsmith sprayed the substance how many times did Luke Tatchell hit the man?A. It would have been maybe about four.
Q. And before David Wildsmith sprayed the substance how many times did [SS] hit the man?A. Would have been about the same, maybe one less.
Q. Three or four then?A. Yes.
Q. After he - withdraw that - how many times did you see [SS] hit the man?A. Would have been about the same, roughly about 20 all up.
Q. Did anyone else hit him?A. [AA] struck him with the golf club.
Q. How many times did [AA] hit him with the golf club?A. Once. 
...
Q. Apart from [SS] and Luke [Tatchell] and [AA], did you see anyone else hit him at that stage?A. No.""
32SF said that the applicant had not been in possession of a weapon during the attack:
""Q. This is fair to say, isn't it, David Wildsmith didn't have, let's set aside the pepper spray for a moment, he didn't have, setting aside the pepper spray any weapon in his hand, that would be fair to say?A. No.
Q. He didn't take a weapon out of the car, right?A. No.
Q. He didn't take it up to Bennett Road, that's fair to say?A. No.
Q. He didn't use a weapon, that's right isn't it?A. Depends whether you call the pepper spray a weapon.
Q. I said let's put the pepper spray aside for a moment. He didn't use a weapon, right?A. Okay, in those states, no. (sic)
...
Q. I think we can come back to this at least, you never saw him touch a weapon right?A. Right.""
33 Later, during cross-examination, he said that he saw the applicant take a metal rod into his house after the incident. When asked why he had not mentioned the fact that the applicant had a rod in his statement to the police or in prior testimony SF said that ""Like to my memory I didn't realise that until you'd mentioned it, it's like I said, I only remember what was in my statement, key points and that"". 
34JM gave evidence that after the victim was pointed out to the group it was SS who urged them not to worry about him. He said it was Tatchell and the applicant who encouraged SS to participate:
""Q. What happened next?A. [SS] saying don't worry about it let it go (sic). David [Wildsmith] and Luke [Tatchell] got in his ear, calling him weak and that.
Q. Was something said before that about Jimbo?A. I don't think so.
Q. But you said that Wildy [David Wildsmith] and Luke [Tatchell] got in his ear?A. Got in [SS]'s ear.
Q. And said what?A. Don't be weak because [SS] didn't want to do anything.
Q. ... All right. Well, tell us if you can, doing the best you can, tell us who said what?A. [SS] said ""just leave it"" and Luke [Tatchell] and David [Wildsmith] were calling him weak.
...
Q. Are you able to say who said ""don't be weak""?A. David [Wildsmith].
Q. Did Luke [Tatchell] say anything?A. I can't remember what he was saying but he was saying something.""
35JM said in his evidence in chief that Tatchell, AC, SF and the applicant then left in AC's vehicle. JM said that after the car returned the applicant and Tatchell told the others to follow them. During cross-examination JM was played CCTV footage from the McDonald's restaurant that clearly showed that the applicant did not leave to get the weapons with the others. After viewing this footage JM accepted that the applicant had not left with the McDonalds restaurant at that time. 
36JM gave evidence that after the two cars reached the underpass the group waited underneath the underpass for ""a couple of minutes"". JM said that the applicant and Tatchell were ""telling us to be quiet"". JM also said that while the group was waiting ""David [Wildsmith] or Luke [Tatchell] threw a bit of wood to [SS]. [SS] tried to say no and they said 'take it don't be a bitch"". JM did not clearly remember whether the applicant or Tatchell had made that statement. 
37JM said that Tatchell was armed with the handle of a shopping trolley and that the applicant had a ""can of mace"". JM said that he knew that the can was mace because the applicant had showed it to the group and ""said it was a can of mace"". JM described the can as being black and approximately 8 mm to 10mm long. 
38JM gave evidence about the attack:
""Q. What happened next?A. Jim walked above us and then we all ran out and when we all got to him [SS] hit him in the leg and then threw the pole and then Chookie [Tatchell] just started hitting him. [AA] and [SS] tried to pull Luke [Tatchell] and that off and Wildy [David Wildsmith] pulled out the mace and maced him.
Q. Let's take it slowly. You say ""we all ran out"", is that right?A. Yes.
Q. And you had to get up to the level of the road, is that right?A. Yes.
Q. Did you all run out the same side of the tunnel?A. Yes.
Q. You all ran. Did you see Jimbo do anything when you ran towards him?A. I was behind everyone.
Q. You say you were behind everyone. Were you the last one out?A. Yeah. Me and Aaron were behind everyone.
Q. And you said the next thing was that [SS] hit him in the leg?A. Yes.
Q. With what?A. The bit of wood.
...
Q. ... What happened then?A. Then Chookie, Luke [Tatchell] sorry, then started hitting him with the trolley pole and he ended up against the house and then David [Wildsmith] maced him and [SS] and [AA] kept trying to rip him off.
Q. You say Luke started hitting him with the trolley pole?A. Yes.
Q. Where was Luke hitting him?A. In the head.
Q. How many times did Luke hit him?A. Over and over.
Q. Did you see anything happen to the man when that happened?A. His hat fell off and there was a big gash....
Q. After you saw the big gash did Luke hit him again after that?A. Yes.
Q. Did anyone else hit him?A. No.
Q. Were the only two people that you saw hit him, were they [SS] and Luke?A. Yes.""
39JM said that the applicant sprayed mace at the victim from a ""couple of metres"" away. JM did not see any spray come out of the can. During the attack JM heard the applicant and Tatchell ""yelling racist stuff"" at the victim. However, he said that there was ""no doubt"" that the applicant had not ""hit the victim with any weapon and did not punch him"". 
40JM stated that he did not see anyone with a golf club. JM also admitted that he had told the Parramatta Children's Court that he did not see anyone other than Tatchell and the applicant attack the victim. He agreed when it was put to him that the evidence he gave in the Children's Court about the applicant hitting the victim was a ""straight lie"" and further agreed that at the Children's Court he was ""prepared to lied, effectively under oath, to put this man [the applicant] in for something he didn't do"". JM said that the reason that he had lied was to protect [SS]. He agreed that when giving evidence in the Children's Court that he did not say that the applicant had maced the victim. JM denied that the reason that he had failed to mention that the applicant had used mace in the Children's Court was because it was a lie. 
41JR gave evidence that Tatchell, the applicant, AC and SF left McDonald's shortly after the victim was pointed out to the group by AH. He admitted during cross-examination that the applicant did not get into the car at that time. JR said that whilst at the McDonalds Restaurant he observed the applicant pull out mace and identify it as mace:
""Q. Did you see them do anything? I'm not asking you whether they did anything bad particularly but anything?A. David pulled out a can of mace.
Q.Where did he pull it out from?A. Like a bumbag thing.
Q. Where was the bumbag thing?A. Around his waist.
Q. He pulled it out and what did you say it was, a can of mace?A. Yeah.
Q. How did you know it was a can of mace?A. That's what he said.
Q. What did he say?A. I can't remember exactly what he said but someone said something along the line of ""What is that"" or something and he told us.
Q. What did he say? When you say he told us, what did he say?A. He said ""It's capsicum spray"".
Q. Did he use the expression ""capsicum spray""?A. No, he said ""mace"".
Q. He said ""mace""?A. Yeah.""
42JR said that when the group arrived at the underpass ""David [Wildsmith] and Luke [Tatchell] were, like, carrying metal poles"". He said that Tatchell and the applicant commenced assaulting the victim with ""poles"" and half way through SS joined in by punching:
""Q. What was [SS] doing?A. I don't know if he was actually hitting the guy at that time. I can't remember but when Luke and David stopped hitting him, I don't know, half way through or something, he started punching him, like he wasn't using any weapons, he was just punching him.""
43JR said that AA also then hit the victim once to his chest, upper part of his body or head, with a golf club. 
44JR said that a man drove past in a ute during the assault and that he was maced by the applicant:
""Q. Apart from the people attacking him and you and the others that were standing back, were there any other people around?A. No, that was pretty much it. There was a guy that drove past in a ute when the assault was happening.
Q. Which way was he going, towards Erskine Park or towards McDonald's?A. Erskine Park Road.
Q. What happened?A. Well, obviously he seen the guy getting hit and he went to stop.
Q. What happened then?A. Then as he went to stop David sprayed him with the mace like through the window I think.
Q. What did you actually see David do at that point? You say he sprayed him through the window with mace, what did you see him do?A. That's what I seen him do.
Q. How did he do it, can you describe how he did it?A. He just, I don't know, the guy went to, I don't know, when the guy was on the road and then the guy sort of pulled over to the side a bit in the ute and then he just, I don't know, sprayed the mace at him through the window in the car.
Q. Could you see David holding the mace?A. Yes.
Q. Did you see him actually spray something?A. I didn't, well--
Q. Can I ask you this. Did you see him holding the container?A. No.
Q. Well, you told us David sprayed the man with mace. Describe what you actually did see if you would, please?A. Well, when the guy pulled over I seen his arm come out.
Q. David's arm come out?A. Yeah, like yeah. Well I don't know. It's hard to explain.
Q. Just take your time. Explain what you saw David do?A. I just said. I just told you. Like I couldn't tell you a hundred per cent exactly what happened, but yeah.
Q. You said David's arm came out. Where was David in relation to the car?A. Well, the guy pulled over right next to where the guy was getting hit and just up a little bit maybe, and then, yeah.
Q. Then you what?A. Then David went and sprayed him.
Q. David approached the car, did he?A. Yeah.
Q. Did he approach the driver's side of the car? Is that what you are describing?A. I don't know if it was the driver's side or not but, can't remember. I don't know if he sprayed through the window.
Q. Did you see some spray go through the window?A. Not through the window, but I seen some spray come out at something, yeah.
Q. You saw some spray come out?A. Yeah.""
45JR said that he could not recall the applicant macing the victim: 
""Q. So David Wildsmith did not spray Jimbo, that would be fair to say?A. Not when he was hitting him, no.
Q. At any time?A. Can't think at the moment. I don't know.
HIS HONOURQ. You don't know, is that your answer?A. Yeah.
MR BRADYQ. You just don't know one way or the other, is that what you say?A. Well, I can't think at the moment.""
46It is plain that there are inconsistencies in the evidence of the three witnesses. The incident itself took place in a very short space of time. The victim was pointed out to the group at 3.39 pm. By 3.45 pm the group had obtained weapons and left the McDonald's car park. The 000 call was made at 3.53 pm. The attack itself took no longer that a minute. In the circumstance of an attack including multiple assailants over a short period of time inconsistencies in the evidence of the three witnesses is unsurprising. As McHugh J said in M at 534:
""It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness's evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital - such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue - discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness's account may make it impossible to accept that person's evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of the occurrence of a witnesses general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.""
47Notwithstanding the inconsistencies, the evidence is clear that the applicant travelled to the scene in the car with Tatchell together with the weapons Tatchell had sourced from his home. The weapons were removed from the car in the applicant's presence and handed out in his presence. All three witnesses indicated that the applicant was physically involved in the attack upon the victim. SF said that the applicant used mace on the victim. JR said that the applicant used a metal pole and he said that he also observed the applicant with mace at the scene. JM gave evidence that the applicant maced the victim, although he later admitted that he did not see mace come out of the can. JM also said he saw the applicant in possession of a metal pole after the attack. The inference that the applicant joined in the attack with the requisite intention is plainly open on this evidence. 
48In relation to Ground 1(i) the applicant submitted that there was no objectively verifiable evidence of mace being used. This was accepted by the Crown. 
49There were a number of sources of evidence that failed to support, or even contradicted, the use of mace spray. The sunglasses and cap worn by the deceased were forensically analysed. This analysis did not disclose the presence of any of the chemical constituents of mace or pepper spray.
50Evidence was also given by the paramedic who attended the victim shortly after the attack. The paramedic said that the victim did not complain of any of the symptoms that commonly accompany the use of mace or pepper spray, such as burning eyes or skin. There was, according to the paramedic, nothing suggesting injuries inflicted by mace. 
51In addition to the evidence from the paramedic, evidence was given by two eyewitnesses to the assault who were driving in Bennett Road while the attack took place. Neither saw mace sprayed. One remembered a ute stopping, however he did not see the driver of the ute being sprayed with mace.
52The respondent submitted that the lack of evidence supporting the use of mace was not fatal to the Crown case. The Crown submitted at the trial that the absence may be explained by the use of a spray by the applicant that was incorrectly identified as mace. It was also submitted that mace may have been sprayed but was not detected by forensic examination. 
Conclusion on Ground 1
53I have reviewed the entirety of the evidence. Although I acknowledge the inconsistencies in the evidence given by the witnesses to the events, the jury had the advantage of seeing the witnesses in the context and atmosphere of the trial. The jury were satisfied that the accused had participated in the attack upon the victim, with the requisite intention. The evidence given at the trial was capable of supporting the charge and bearing in mind the advantage which the jury had, I have no doubt that the applicant was rightly convicted.  
54I reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 2:That in light of the verdicts of manslaughter for SS, AC and AA the verdict of murder against the applicant is unsustainable.
55The jury returned a verdict of murder in respect of the applicant but returned verdicts of manslaughter in respect of AC, AA and SS. The applicant submitted that this gave rise to inconsistent verdicts founded on factual matters, rather than matters of a technical or legal nature. Accordingly it was submitted that for this reason the jury's verdict in respect of the applicant was unreasonable. The principals to be applied in cases where jury verdicts are said to be factually inconsistent were set out by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 at [119]-[121]:
""[119] The present case is not one where there were verdicts that were legally or technically inconsistent with each other on the face of the record. Verdicts are inconsistent in that sense where, for example, a person is convicted of being both thief and receiver or of attempting to commit an offence and committing that offence. In earlier times, verdicts in a conspiracy case would be inconsistent in this technical sense if one of two conspirators was found not guilty and the other convicted. But it is now established that there is no necessary inconsistency in a verdict of conviction and a verdict of acquittal in such cases. 
[120] When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
[121] In determining whether the inconsistency points to an unsatisfactory conviction, the appellate court must consider the evidence, the issues, and the directions which the jury were given. In a case where the accused claimed that his conviction should be set aside because of the inconsistency of verdicts, McGarvie J said [in R v Bacash [1981] VR 923 at 929] '[i]n considering this question it is vital to consider the way in which the trial judge charged the jury'. An examination of the directions, issues and evidence may confirm that apparently inconsistent verdicts are in fact inconsistent and demonstrate that the conviction is unsafe. Just as frequently, however, examination of the issues, evidence and directions may show that apparently inconsistent verdicts are not inconsistent and that there has been no failure in the reasoning process of the jury.""
56The issue in Osland was whether verdicts delivered by different juries in separate trials were inconsistent. In R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; (2005) 63 NSWLR 628 a five member bench of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal applied the same principles to circumstances where allegedly inconsistent verdicts were returned by the same jury in a joint trial. Howie and Johnson JJ said at [44]:
""...the question that arises is whether, in light of the evidence, the issues raised and the directions given to the jury 'no reasonable jury who applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts'."" 
57Although in the present case much of the evidence of the various witnesses was admissible in relation to each of the accused there were a number of significant differences in the evidence available in relation to the three juvenile offenders (SS, AC and AA) and the applicant. 
58SS, AC and AA had no prior criminal convictions. They each called evidence of good character and received the benefit of a good character direction from the trial judge. The jury were entitled to have regard to this evidence when assessing the question that they had committed the alleged offence. 
59Prior to the trial AC had participated in an ERISP, which became Exhibit U in the trial. The applicant did not participate in an ERISP. Accordingly the jury had an account of events from AC available to it when assessing the case against him. 
60Similarly, in relation to SS evidence was given by Miad Anari Shahidi, a close friend of SS, to whom SS had admitted to hitting the victim in the legs as part of a plan to hurt the victim rather than hitting the victim in the head. Counsel for SS submitted that if this evidence was accepted it would support a conviction for manslaughter but not murder.  
61The central issue at trial was whether each of the accused was party to a joint criminal enterprise to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased or to assault the deceased with the contemplation that grievous bodily harm may result. The age of each of the accused was identified by counsel and the trial judge as relevant to their understanding of what was going to occur and their intention when participating in the assault. 
62Counsel for each of AC, SS and AA emphasised the relatively young age of their clients in their final addresses to the jury. Counsel distinguished the applicant and Tatchell from the other accused as being ""slightly older and bigger young men"". In response to a question from the jury about how they were to determine the intention of each of the accused the trial judge said:
""You may think it relevant to have regard to the ages of the various accused and the particular accused that you are considering. The fact that they were, I think in every case, very young men, 17 and 18,....these are ....matters which are potentially available to you depending upon your view and depending upon your satisfaction as to the particular role of each accused, if any, from which you may draw an inference of intention.""
63His Honour also said that the jury should:
""Bear in mind always that you are dealing here with a group of very young people. I think one counsel referred to his client as a boy. Some of them were just out of school.""
64Apart from these matters the jury were clearly instructed about the need to scrutinise the case of each accused separately and reminded that there was the potential for different verdicts. In his remarks at the commencement of the trial the trial judge explained the nature of a joint trial to the jury in the following terms:
""This is what is termed a joint trial and it proceeds as a joint trial as a matter of convenience, that is a lot of the same witnesses are called in the Crown case against each accused and therefore it's convenient that they give their evidence in the one trial, but at the end of the case you will be asked to consider the case against each accused. 
Now most of the evidence that you will hear will be admissible against all accused but there will be some evidence, no doubt, which will be admissible against a particular accused and you will be told exactly what evidence is admissible against each accused, and ultimately your task will be to determine a separate verdict in relation to each accused based upon the evidence admissible against each accused, and that, as I say, will be identified for you. So at no stage should you approach you task by considering whether they are guilty. You must consider each case individually. It would be quite wrong and unfair to approach it in that way. You must consider the case for and against each accused quite separately, and as I say at the end of the trial you will be asked for your separate verdicts in relation to each accused.""
65In his summing up the trial judge said:
""...you are considering five separate cases. They do not have to all have necessarily the same answer. Each accused and the agreement, if any, or the joining of the joint criminal enterprise, if any, by that accused is to be considered in the light of the evidence relating to that accused. So that, one accused, for instance, to give an example and I'm not suggesting any answer to the question, one accused may have a clear notion of what is going to happen right from the outset, and he and another accused might have a joint criminal enterprise to hit this victim right from McDonalds. Others may be in the situation that Mr Pontello described, you remember his example of people going to the botanical gardens, some have an intention, some don't quite know what they are going to do until they get there, and so on. Others may later join in, and consequently they may later, you may get a situation where in respect of a particular accused you determine that that accused did not join the joint criminal enterprise until a moment which is later in time than a previous accused. For instance you may place emphasis upon, [and] it is a matter for you, different vehicles, one vehicle was involved in going to Luke Tatchell's, one wasn't. That may or may not be a relevant matter but I am simply giving you an illustration of why you must consider each accused individually and the answers relating to that accused may therefore be different to another accused.""
Conclusion on Ground 2
66I fully appreciate that the applicant may believe that the jury's verdict is unfair to him compared with his younger companions. However, I have given careful consideration to the applicant's submissions. I am satisfied that the jury's verdict can be rationally explained by the evidence which was favourable to the younger accused and the role which their youth may have played in their understanding of and participation in the relevant events. I am not persuaded that the reasoning process of the jury relevantly failed. I reject this ground of appeal. 
Orders
Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed. 
67JOHNSON J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
68ROTHMAN J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		30 August 2012",2012-06-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708137,R v Page (No 2) [2012] NSWDC 308,"SENTENCE
1Harley Page was charged by the police with robbery in company.  He denied that he was guilty and the Director of Public Prosecutions found an indictment against him for that crime and it was presented before a jury in Newcastle earlier this year.  I presided over the trial and at the end of trial, on 17 February 2012, the jury found Mr Harley Page guilty of robbery in company.  What I am doing this morning is sentencing Mr Page for that offence.
2I need to say something about what happened that brought about the charge and I also need to make reference to his personal circumstances, as well as to the arguments which have been presented to me this morning by his representative, Mr S Corish of counsel, and by Mr GW Coles, the solicitor advocate who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  
3The offence occurred in the streets of Newcastle at night time on 20 January 2011.  A group of four young people had spent the evening together and were making their way home.  Two men approached the group.  One was Mr Harley Page.  The other was his brother, Levi Page.  
4One of the young men was Mr Jordan Smith.  He gave a description of what happened personally to him.  Harley Page, I accept beyond reasonable doubt, was carrying something in his hand which was something like an iron bar or steel bar.  He confronted Jordan Smith and was, I accept, about an arm's length away from Jordan Smith.  Jordan Smith backed away towards a laneway and at some stage Harley Page was joined by his brother, Levi Page, in this confrontation.  Jordan Smith describes both men as being an arm's length away from him.  He took some extra steps while he was walking back, he missed a step or two and then Levi Page broke away and focused his attention on one of the other group.  Jordan Smith gave an estimate of about 30 seconds to a minute that he was confronted by both men, including Harley Page.  
5I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that estimate is an exact estimate of the period of time of the confrontation.  I say that because there was a lot going on for Jordan Smith at the time and making estimates of the period of time over which such events occurred must be very difficult.  However, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that for at least a few moments - which involved a period of time that Jordan Smith was walking backwards and taking several steps - he was confronted by both men, one of whom, Harley Page, was carrying something threatening like an iron bar.  
6Jordan Smith said that he had ""hardly any money"".  He pulled his wallet out sensibly and readily.  In fact he had some coins in his wallet which he made available to Harley Page.  Harley Page took the coins.  That completed the robbery in company.
7There was, I accept, no threat of violence uttered in words by Harley Page towards Jordan Smith but Harley Page's behaviour in confronting Jordan Smith was clearly designed, successfully, to secure compliance with Harley Page's demand for money.  I accept that is was done, as Mr Coles said, in a calculated way in the sense that the iron bar was obviously meant to assist in compelling the victim to comply with the demand.  
8Harley Page and his brother got away but were arrested a short time later.
9I should add that I take into account as an aggravating factor of the robbery in company the fact that it involved the threatened use of a weapon.  I accept that the iron bar was in Harley Page's hand and was being moved around, not in any directly threatening way but it was clearly there and had a threatening effect.  I do not take into account as an additional aggravating factor that the offence involved actual or threatened use of violence.  To my mind the aggravating feature of the use or threatened use of a weapon covers that in the circumstances of this case.  
10It was an opportunistic crime.  Harley Page and his brother had been drinking for a long time and were well affected by alcohol.  
11Levi Page pleaded guilty to an assault with an attempt to rob one of the other young men.  That crime is an offence against s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.  
12The crime that I am sentencing Harley Page for, namely robbery in company, is a more serious offence.  It is a crime against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment.  
13When Levi Page pleaded guilty, I sentenced him to imprisonment for 2 years but suspended that sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  Mr Corish acknowledged that the principle of parity does not strictly apply because I sentenced Levi Page for a different offence which carried a different maximum but, as he observed, Harley Page's crime arose out of the same facts.  
14Harley Page, when he was tried earlier this year, was already in custody, bail refused, charged with other offences.  He has been in custody since 26 August 2011 and I will date my sentence from that date.  Although he has been in custody between 26 August 2011 and my refusal of bail on 17 February 2012 when he was found guilty, I am going to take that other period into account because I am advised by Mr Corish he has not yet been tried for those other offences.  There is obviously the possibility that he could be acquitted of the other offences and that period in custody would never be taken into account.  If I do take it into account in this sentence and he is convicted and sentenced for one or other of the other offences then the sentencing judge can take into account the fact that I have backdated this sentence.
15Harley Page has a criminal record, but I regard it as negligible.  There are some offences involving use of a car and a malicious damage to property and a resist arrest.  He was fined for all of those offences.  I do not take into account at all two offences which occurred in 2009 for which he received a good behaviour bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act because there was no conviction involved.  
16A pre-sentence report has been prepared by a Probation and Parole Officer for Mr Harley Page.  He has been taking cannabis and alcohol since his mid-teen years and has, as the Probation Officer described, ""a history of drug and alcohol use from his teenage years which has developed into a significant AOD problem"".  I do not agree that his employment history, described as ""negligent"" (which I assume should read ""negligible"") by the Probation and Parole Officer should be so described.  His employment history is respectable having been in employment for some 6 months before he was arrested for this offence.  Harley Page has recently turned 23.
17Mr Coles in his written and oral submissions reminded me of the guideline judgment for armed robbery which also applies to robbery in company.  The guideline judgment that he was referring to was of course R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149.  Most of the factors which are referred to in the guideline judgment are relevant to Mr Harley Page.  I do take into account, as Mr Corish has said, that the weapon held by his client, namely the iron bar, was slightly less serious than a knife and was not expressly used in a threatening way.  However, the distinction is not great.  The weapon was still capable of inflicting serious injury as the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Henry.  The significant difference of course between Mr Harley Page's case and the guideline judgment is that Mr Harley Page has been convicted by me - which I do so now in case I have not before - after being found guilty by a jury.  That does not make his penalty any more severe at all, but it means that he does not have the benefit which is accorded to those who plead guilty and that benefit is taken into account in the guideline judgment.  
18I have had regard also to the statistics from the Judicial Commission which have been made available to me by Mr Coles which became MFI 1.  
19I have also taken into account that, as Mr Corish pointed out this morning, his client is serving his period in custody in protective custody.  Were it not for that factor, I would have regarded an appropriate sentence as one of 4½ years in custody but I propose to fix a sentence of 4 years in custody.  It is not below the range in Henry which Mr Corish agitated me to impose.  The reason for that is that Mr Harley Page does not have the significant benefit of a plea of guilty.  
20He is still a young man and, as Mr Corish says, acknowledges his drug and alcohol problem which is a good start.  I propose to consider that as a special circumstance for adjusting the normal ratio between a non-parole period and a full sentence.  Normally, a non-parole period is three quarters of a full sentence, so in this case Mr Harley Page should serve a non-parole period of 3 years.  I propose to reduce that to 2½ years.  As I have said, I propose to backdate the sentence to when he first went into custody on 26 August 2011.  So the sentence that I will impose in a moment will be from 26 August 2011 to 25 August 2015.  The non-parole period will be from 26 August 2011 to 25 February 2014.
21I convict you of the offence Mr Page and I set a non-parole period of 2½ years to commence on 26 August 2011 and to expire on 25 February 2014.  The balance of the term will be 18 months commencing on 26 February 2014 and expiring on 25 August 2015.  The overall sentence is 4 years.  The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 25 February 2014.  
HIS HONOUR:  Two things gentlemen.  One is any factual issues could be dealt with now; and the second is the mathematics.CORISH:  No your Honour.HIS HONOUR:  Because the sentence is over 3 years I don't give an order for parole.CORISH:  You don't order that he be released to parole, that's not up to you now your Honour, that's up to the Parole Board - Parole Authority they now call themselves or Parliament now calls them.HIS HONOUR:  Yes, alright.  
22Harley Page, you have received a 4 year sentence.  I backdated it for the reasons that I said when you were first arrested for other matters on 26 August 2011.  Your sentence expires 4 years from then, so your sentence expires on 25 August 2015.  The non-parole period is a bit less than it should be.  Normally it would be 3 years for a 4 year sentence but I have made it 2½ years.  It starts as well on when you were arrested first up and it will expire on 25 February 2014.  As Mr Corish and I just said, I do not order your release on that day.  The Parole Authority will deal with whether you get parole on 25 February 2014 or not.  It depends on all sorts of factors.

2The trial indictment pleaded three counts:

Count 1: That on 12 March 2009 at Lane Cove the appellant stole a computer, modem and router, the property of Deborah Hill & Co Chartered Accountants.

This was an offence contrary to s117 Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.

Count 2: That on 12 March 2009 at Lane Cove the appellant assaulted Deborah Hill.

This was an offence contrary to s61 Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 2 years.

3On 15 December 2009 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 1, 2 and 3.

4On 19 March 2010 her Honour sentenced the appellant in relation to those offences to the following terms of imprisonment:

5The aggregate sentence imposed on the appellant consisted of a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months commencing 14 December 2009 and expiring 13 March 2011 with a balance of term of 9 months expiring 13 December 2011. The appellant was released to parole on 13 March 2011.

6A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 12 January 2010 which was extended to 7 October 2011. On 29 October 2010 a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed consisting of two grounds of appeal against conviction and four grounds of appeal against sentence. On 30 November 2011 the appellant filed a further document entitled ""Grounds of Appeal"", which increased the grounds of appeal against conviction to fourteen, and against sentence to six. The amended document had annexed to it a large quantity of written submissions (124 pages), together with a large number of annexures (in excess of 150 pages).

7The grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant in respect of his conviction are:

""Ground 1 - That the trial miscarried as a result of hearsay evidence being admitted."" (This ground repeats the earlier ground 1.)

""Ground 2 - That the trial miscarried as a result of the Crown Advocate putting to the jury that the appellant had lied in relation to twelve matters, none of which had been put to him in cross-examination. Separately the twelve lies appear substantially to have been misstated by the Crown Advocate."" (This ground repeats the earlier ground 2 but with the addition of the last sentence.)

""Ground 3 - Justice miscarried when her Honour failed to give a correct ruling on spent or old convictions.

Ground 4 - The trial miscarried when the learned trial judge failed to give adequate directions to the jury on real issues in the trial.

Ground 5 - The trial miscarried when the learned trial judge allowed inadmissible police statements into evidence in breach of s33.

Ground 6 - Justice miscarried when ""prejudicial"" information was continually stated to the jury.

Ground 7 - For Count 3, the verdict was unsafe given new evidence and correct direction on the evidence of the offence.

Ground 8 - A substantial miscarriage of justice occurred when the Crown misconducted himself at the trial.

Ground 9 - A miscarriage of justice occurred when both the defence solicitor and counsel failed to take any direction before or during the trial.

Ground 10 - Justice miscarried when her Honour revoked the accused's bail mid trial and prevented a fair trial being run.

Ground 11 - Justice miscarried when her Honour prevented crucial evidence being adduced by the accused and defence counsel in breach of s79 of the Evidence Act.

Ground 12 - Based on ""new evidence"" from the ICAA, the convictions are unreasonable and unsupported having regard to all the evidence.

Ground 13 - In relation to a claim of right, that the convictions are unreasonable in the circumstances.

Ground 14 - In the context of the previous 13 appeal grounds, the verdicts in this matter are unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.""

8The grounds of appeal against sentence are:

""Ground 1 - That the learned trial judge erred in failing to have regard to the fact that the said offending conduct could be dealt with in the Local Court, where the maximum penalty of 12 months would apply."" (This ground repeats the earlier ground 1.)

""Ground 2 - That the learned trial judge erred in failing to reflect her finding as to the low objective seriousness of the robbery in the sentence."" (This ground repeats the earlier ground 2.)

""Ground 3 - That the learned trial judge erred in her application of the principles of totality by partially accumulating the sentences and for effectively ""double punishing"" the offender for the assault charge."" (This ground repeats the earlier ground 3.)

""Ground 4 - That the learned trial judge erred in that discounts for protective custody were not applied to this sentence.

Ground 5 - That material errors, fabrications and misunderstandings of fact influenced the sentencing of the Applicant.

Ground 6 - That the sentence is manifestly excessive."" (this ground repeats the earlier ground 4.)

9Written submissions dated 28 October 2010 were received from Ms Nash of counsel in respect of Grounds of Appeal against conviction 1 and 2. The subsequent amended Grounds of Appeal and submissions were prepared by the appellant himself. At the hearing, the appellant appeared for himself. 

Conviction Appeal
Factual background and evidence at trial

10The evidence called on behalf of the Crown was as follows. Ms Deborah Hill (the complainant) worked as a chartered accountant at Lane Cove under the style of ""Deborah Hill & Co Chartered Accountants"". In March 2008 the appellant approached her to do some accounting work for his company, Terra Cresta Business Solutions Pty Limited, (the company). The company was facing liquidation if it could not establish its solvency. The complainant was asked to prepare the company's accounts so as to show it was not insolvent.

11The complainant said that she did not want to risk not being paid, and accordingly insisted that the appellant pay her. The complainant said that her agreement was with the appellant not the company. Exhibit A1 was the complainant's Terms of Engagement and Costs Agreement which set out her estimate of fees of $1500 - $3500 and which included a recital ""Should you wish us to perform additional services our fees will be based on the time required by the individuals assigned to the engagement plus any out of pocket expenses"".

12Pursuant to the agreement, the appellant made an upfront payment of $950 to the complainant and on 8 April 2008, a further payment of $1,300. Both those payments were in cash. 

13The complainant said that she had difficulty in balancing the company's accounts. On 22 April 2008 she invoiced the appellant for $4,526.50 for the work involved in the reconciliation of the balances. This was in addition to the monies already paid by the appellant to her.

14It was the complainant's evidence that when the appellant picked up the signed accounts on 24 April 2008, he said that he did not have the cash to pay her and would give her three cheques which she was to present a few days apart. The appellant dated the cheques on the days he told the complainant to present them. The first cheque was for $231 dated 24 April 2008; the second for $1,526.50 dated 27 April 2008 and the third for $3000 dated 29 April 2008.

15The complainant said that she tried to deposit the first two cheques on the days nominated, but received letters from her bank returning the two cheques on the basis that there were insufficient funds in the account. Thereafter, the complainant received a series of emails from the appellant (29 April, 30 April and 4 May 2008) seeking to explain why the cheques could not be met.

16On 6 May 2008 the complainant's assistant, Ms Theodor, requested payment of the outstanding account. The appellant expressed shock at the size of the outstanding amount, but in a note recorded by Ms Theodor he said ""I am not saying I am not paying you ... I just haven't got the money"" (exhibit A6.4).

17In the ensuing weeks, more requests for payment of the account were made on behalf of the complainant and some payments by way of instalments were made. The first documented complaint by the appellant concerning the outstanding account occurred in an email of 24 June 2004 as follows:

""Deborah, this is not what you agreed with me the other day. You said you would provide the file etc if I paid $750 and I've now paid another $1000. Given you quoted like $1500 and then charged me $7K I do not feel that this has been at all a constructive/fair or a beneficial exercise. The time for me to lodge evidence has been extended several times and can't be extended any further. If they do not have this stuff by COB tomorrow, they will likely show I am insolvent as I can't give financials indicating otherwise. In that case you would need to chase a liquidator for the balance of funds as the company won't be mine. I don't think you are being fair at all given the amount I have already paid and the circumstances of the size of your invoices or my current proceedings. It is really a form of blackmail whether you care to admit it. The bills can only get paid when I have funds.

I do not want accounts to 30 June, I want to the point that we did end of April which was a few transactions for interest. It's not a lot of work and certainly not $7K. Your call.

Regards,

Owen"". (Exhibit A6.7)

18The complainant agreed to do further work for the appellant and in fact did so. She received two further payments by way of instalments from the appellant - $500 on 3 July and $100 on 5 September 2008. Between 2 July and 29 July 2008 she issued three further invoices for work ($577.50, $350 and $280). No further payments were received from the appellant. The complainant said that the balance owed by the appellant as at 5 September 2008 was $3615. Ms Theodor continued to request payment of the outstanding amount from the appellant. The appellant did not respond.

19On 5 March 2009 the complainant arranged for the two rejected cheques for $231 and $1526.50 to be represented. This time they were met, thereby reducing the amount which the complainant said was owed by the appellant to $1857.50.

20On 10 March 2009 Ms Theodor received a phone call from the appellant in which he appeared to be angry and said that the monies needed to be back in his account in the next hour or there would be ""serious consequences"". Ms Theodor made a note at the time ""Owen claims he does not owe us money"". On that same day, the complainant prepared an account setting out the amount that was still outstanding. She wrote on the account: ""Owen, this is the current status of your account. You have not returned our telephone calls and have not provided us with an address to mail you. We would be grateful if you would address this outstanding amount as soon as possible"".

21At about 9.30am on 12 March 2009 the appellant telephoned the complainant and sent a text message to her to the effect that they were committing fraud and that he had contacted the bank and so advised it. Not long afterwards, the complainant was walking back to her office when Ms Theodor rang. She was crying and said that the appellant had just been to the office. The complainant telephoned the police. She said that she did so because she wanted the police to be at the office before she arrived as she was six and a half months pregnant. When she arrived the police were there and she saw that the wires for her modem and router were sticking out and that the modem and router were missing.

22The complainant's office was networked. She could not access any of her data without going through a modem, so she bought a new modem and router. She could not get them to work and asked a technician from the shop to come over and get them working. She and Ms Theodor had been locking the office door every time they went to the toilet, but when the technician came they forgot to lock the door after him. 

23At about 12 or 12.30pm on 12 March 2009 the appellant walked into the office. The complainant was talking to the technician at the time. The appellant said ""You owe me money. I want my money"" and started shouting that she had taken his money from his kids' mouths. The complainant told Ms Theodor to call the police. Her evidence was:

""He sort of like pushed me on the chest. I think it was like more open handed pushing me, I'm not sure. I just fell backwards and then he said, ""Give me my money or there's going to be serious consequences"", and that's when I said to him ""There's already serious consequences. You just assaulted me"". And that's when he got and pushed me - he pushed me harder then, and then I moved back from the office quite quickly and sort of hit the back of my desk and then - we sort of stood up again and then he saw a laptop on my desk and he just said he - he kept - all he kept saying was ""I want my money, I want my money"" he was shouting"". (T49-50)

24The complainant said that the appellant came right up to her, looked into her eyes and said ""You're dead"" (T.53). He then grabbed the laptop and ""started to take all the cables out of the back and then grabbed it"". The complainant said that the appellant was holding the laptop to his chest with both hands across his chest when she grabbed the two edges of the laptop and tried to get it from him. ""Then he was trying to swing me around. He was just trying to shove - get rid of me by shoving me around and the laptop, he had it here and I had hold of it and he was like pushing it like this and swinging it back this way"". The complainant said that the appellant took one of his arms off the laptop and was trying to push her away from him.

25The struggle for the laptop continued through the door of the office and down a flight of stairs until the complainant was pushed again. The complainant said that she then moved away from the appellant because she was concerned for her unborn child. She said that without the laptop, she could not run her business. The complainant called the police and she and Ms Theodor made statements at the police station.

26A few days later, perhaps 16 March 2009, a courier came to the complainant's office with two bags. Inside the bags were her modem, router and laptop. At the time when the courier arrived, she had a different computer technician in her office fixing up the router. At trial the complainant gave the following evidence in relation to what then happened:

""""A. ... When I said to him, ""Look my laptop is returned"", he turned it on and said, ""Well we'd better have a look at it because you don't know what this guy has done to it"".

Q. Was that the same technician who had been there a few days earlier?
A. No, no it's a different guy. And he went and did a few scans and virus checks and he said, ""There's a virus on it and also someone has enabled Blue Tooth"". And as he was explaining it to me he could see that the mouse was moving on the screen. He said, ""Someone else is operating this. I'm closing down the wireless sections so no-one can access your machine without it being on the cable that you use in the office."" (T.54.3)

27Under cross-examination the following exchange took place:

""Q. You understood that any entitlement to recover fees in relation to the work you were doing was an entitlement as against Terra Cresta Business Solutions Pty Limited?
A. I had a discussion with Owen Salmon regarding this because when he came to me he told me that there was a legal battle going on between the company that he ran and another company that he was trying to recover some one from and that there was no money in this company. And there was basically, the only asset was the asset that he was trying to recover through the courts. So that's when he said that he would be paying for the work that had to be done, because I said to him, how am I going to get paid then, if the company hasn't got any money how is this going to happen, and he said, ""I'm paying the accounts."" (T.65.1)

28A further exchange took place during the cross-examination of the complainant:

""Q. Again, you understood there to be a significant degree of urgency for this material to be provided?
A. Yes, look I was more than happy to stop work on this. I didn't like the fact that I was owed money and I was still prepared to do more work. I didn't want to do it and I thought, ""What do I do?"" Do I leave this guy in the lurch so if I back off and do nothing then nothing gets done for this guy and he doesn't have his day in court and he doesn't have the information he needs because he's not going to find anyone else to do it. I would more than happy have said, ""No, I'm not going to do it"" but I felt that I would not be putting this guy in a very good position by walking away and especially having got this far in doing this work it wasn't that much work for me to produce the 2008 accounts for him.

Q. Prior to receiving that email from him on 26 June you had had conversations with him about your requirements before you'd undertake this additional work, hadn't you?
A. I can't recall exactly what you are referring to but we did have discussions before the email.

...

Q. Can I suggest that the paragraph in that email, 'for my part I confirm that you have a personal undertaking from me', was something that you had discussed with him before him sending this email?
A. I had discussed with him that I wanted to get paid and I wanted him to confirm he was going to pay me.

Q. In effect, that paragraph was something that you dictated to him, isn't it?
A. I don't recall.

Q. That it was your requirement that he provide in writing at least in an email form a personal undertaking that the outstanding balance of $3007 would be paid?
A. I wanted him to confirm that he was going to pay my account. (T.80.29 - 81.13)

29The email to which reference is made was dated 26 June 2008 from the appellant to the complainant and said ""For my part I confirm that you have a personal undertaking from me that the outstanding balance on your account of $3007 will be paid in full at my first opportunity"".

30Ms Theodor gave evidence. She was the complainant's office assistant. She identified file notes setting out attempts by her to obtain payment of the outstanding account from the appellant. She identified the file note of 10 March 2009 when the appellant referred to ""serious consequences"" unless the monies covered by the two cheques were returned to his account.

31She gave evidence about an attendance by the appellant at the complainant's office shortly after 9.30am on 12 March 2009. She gave details of the appellant's intimidating behaviour which led to her seeking assistance from the occupier of the next office. It was as a result of this confrontation, that Ms Theodor called the police and then contacted the complainant. She locked the office door and waited for the police to come. During that time the appellant came back and stood outside the glass door and banged on the door. He only left when Ms Theodor commenced to telephone the police.

32She gave evidence that later that day when the complainant and a computer technician were present, the appellant entered the office again. She said that the appellant pushed the complainant out of the way and grabbed her laptop. She said that there was a lot of pushing sideways and that the complainant was trying to stop him taking the laptop. There was a lot of yelling from both the complainant and the appellant. Ms Theodor rang 000.

33Under cross-examination Ms Theodor said that she began contacting the appellant about his outstanding accounts after 29 April and that the first time he complained about the amount of the account was in about August 2008. She said that she was very careful when making file notes to record the actual words used.

34Evidence was given by the computer technician, Minghui Zhao, who was present on 12 March 2009 at approximately 12.30pm when the confrontation took place between the complainant and the appellant. He said that when he was behind the desk doing some work on the router, a man entered the office and commenced talking to the complainant. He said that they were talking loudly which was what made him pay attention. He saw the man disconnect a laptop computer from the network and attempt to remove it. He observed a struggle between the complainant and the man over the laptop.

35He observed that the complainant and the man were shouting at each other and arguing but he could not recall what words were said. He said that the complainant was unsuccessful in trying to get the laptop back and that as the man tried to leave the office, the complainant was still trying to get the laptop back. Mr Zhao said ""They push over, push each other"" (T.151). He said that at one point the man pushed the complainant out of his way. He said that the complainant followed the man out of the office and he heard shouting on the stairway. He said that the other woman in the office looked scared and was crying.

36Evidence was given by Senior Constable Murphy as to complaints made to him by the complainant and Ms Theodor concerning the confrontation with the appellant.

37Senior Constable Ella Fitzpatrick gave evidence. She attended the offices of the complainant on the morning of 12 March after Ms Theodor reported her confrontation with the appellant. While she was at the office, the complainant arrived and told her that the appellant was a former client who owed her money and that after trying to get in contact with him for a long time, she banked two previously dishonoured cheques. The complainant told her that her modem was missing (T.163).

38Senior Constable Fitzpatrick then telephoned the appellant. Her evidence concerning the conversation was as follows:

""I said, is this Owen Salmon? What sounded like an adult male voice said yes. I said, Owen this is Senior Constable Fitzpatrick from Chatswood police, I'm ringing you regarding an incident that has
just occurred in Lane Cove, do you know what I'm talking about?
The person purporting to be the accused said, yes, I do. I said, what's going on? The accused said, they've stolen my money and I want it back. That money was to feed my kids. I said, you should have come into the station and make a proper report rather than taking the matter into your own hands. The accused said, well I've
reported it to the bank and they will send it to you. I said, it doesn't work that way, Owen, you need to come into the station yourself and make the report. Are you able to come into the station, we need to talk about what's just happened? The accused said, come and get me. I said, where are you then? The accused said, come and find me. I said, you're not making this any better for yourself, what's the deal with the modem? The accused said, I took the modem until they pay me the money that they owe me. I said, Owen, you can't do that, it doesn't work that way."" (T.164.7)

39At around 12.50pm Senior Constable Fitzpatrick again attended the complainant's office and together with other police, was told about the removal of the laptop and what had happened. At about 1.48pm she telephoned the appellant. Her evidence concerning the conversation was as follows:

""I said Owen what sounded like an adult mail voice similar to that of the person that I have spoken with earlier who had purported to be the accused said, yes, I said it's Senior Constable Fitzpatrick again, where is the laptop. The accused said ""I took the laptop and I'm going to sell it on E-Bay so I can get my money back"". I said Owen you can't do that, the accused said I will get my money back trust me. I said how are you going to do that? The accused said ""Don't worry about that"". The conversation continued for a short time while I organised for the defendant to come into Chatswood Police Station later that day. The conversation was then terminated."" (T.165.45)

40As part of the Crown case, the DVD of the appellant's recorded interview with the police was played to the jury and tendered (exhibit C). The relevant parts of that interview were:

""Q17 For the purpose of this interview what is your full name, date of birth and address?
A. ... Salmon ... 67. Suite 245/91 to 93 Longueville Road, Lane Cove.

...

Q41 O,K. It's also been alleged between 12.30 and 12.55 you have grabbed a, a laptop off a desk.
A. Yeah. I took a laptop.

Q42 What can you tell me about that?
A. Ah, Deborah Hill was told to pay money back that she stole from me ---

Q43 Yeah.
A. --- and in lieu of that she was told that I would be happy to take her computers if she couldn't pay me. She said, ""Yeah. Go ahead"". So, I came. After she assaulted me I took a laptop.

Q44 O.K. Well, what's been alleged is you have grabbed the laptop ---
A. Ah hmmm.

Q44 --- Miss Hill's still holding it and you've had a tug-of-war with the laptop.
A. No. She assaulted me before I got anywhere near any computers. She assaulted me when I went near the computer. She assaulted me when I grabbed the computer and she assaulted me on the way out the door and down the stairs.

Q45 O.K.
A. Whilst her own staff are witnessing that and telling her to stop it.

Q46 O.K. It's been alleged that you removed the laptop from her, from her desk, you've struggled with it. You've finally got hold of the laptop. You've pulled all the cables out.
A. Ah hmm.

Q47 And then walked away with. What can you tell me about that?
A. That's correct. I said I took a laptop.

Q48 O.K. It's then been alleged that you walked from the premises down a flight of stairs ---
A. Correct.

Q48 With the laptop.
A. Well I didn't walk down. I was pushed down.

...

Q91 O.K. Regarding the laptop, where, where is it currently?
A. I've got it in safekeeping.

Q92 Whereabouts?
A. Doesn't matter where, it belongs to me.

Q93 What makes you think you own the laptop?
A. Because Deborah Hill said she wasn't going to pay the money back and therefore I can take the computer go ahead.

Q94 O.K.
A. So, she understands clearly. She pays back the money she stole or I'll eBay the computer.

Q95 Well, she, in her statement she hasn't said anything about going into a verbal agreement about exchanging laptops.
A This lady's a very good, con, con-woman so, nothing she says surprises me.

Q96 O.K. So, at this time you believe you are the lawful owner of that laptop?
A. Until she pays me back the money she stole. Yes.

...

Q98 So, can you just run me through the process she explained to you it was O.K. to take the laptop? Is that right?
A. Yeah.

Q99 So, what was, what was the conversation?
A. Ah, basically she told me to get stuffed. She wasn't going to pay the money back. I said, ""Well, you need to pay me in something. If that's computers."" She said, ""Yeah, fine"". That's it. It was about a twenty second conversation.

...

Q142 O.K. And I asked you earlier on in the interview, did you take the router and the modem and you stated, no.
A. I didn't state no.

Q143 But, but now ---
A. I just stated no comment.

Q144 Sorry, you stated, ""No comment?"" So, you're stating now you ---
A. Yeah. I've got a couple of things. I don't know what they are.

Q145 O.K. What, what do they look like? You don't know what a modem ---
A. Oh, it looks like a modem.

Q145 --- router looks like?
A. Yeah.

Q146 O.K. Where is that at the moment?
A. In my safekeeping. Ready to sell if she doesn't return the money.

Q147 O.K. Did you, was there any agreement about the, the modem?
A. Well it's part of the computer equipment so ---

Q148 Just before we go on, Owen, you said that you spoke to Deborah and she said that she wasn't going to pay the money back ---
A. Yeah.

Q148 --- so, to take the computer?
A. Yeah.

...

Q161 Well, I'm just trying to establish whether she would agree to ---
A. I don't care about establish it. She did agree. So as far as I'm concerned I own them until she decides to pay me back and I'll return them.""

41The appellant's case consisted primarily of his own evidence. 

42The appellant said that at the time the complainant was retained, the company was involved in a number of court matters. The predominant one involved a debt owed to it of over $2 million by a company named BACF which had gone into liquidation. In those proceedings the company lost on one claim and won on the other. The court made a costs order against the company in favour of the liquidators of BACF for 80 percent of the costs. The liquidators then took proceedings to wind up the company and it was in that context that he contacted the complainant. The appellant said that he needed the financial returns for the financial year ending 30 June 2007 prepared by an accountant. The task was urgent. The appellant said that the amount of work involved was quite small. 

43The appellant said that he had initially contacted the complainant over the telephone and she had quoted him $1500 for the work. After meeting with her, she sent a retainer agreement to him which had an estimate of $1500 - $3500 for the work. The appellant said that he immediately queried the estimate.

44It was the appellant's evidence that he had a claim of right to take the modem, router and laptop because he had been given a fixed quote of $1500 by the complainant and had paid the initial retainer of $950 and a subsequent amount of $1300. He said that he was given no advance notice that the original estimate would be exceeded. The first he knew of the increased charges was when the complainant handed him the invoice for $4526. The appellant said that he disputed that amount immediately and continued to dispute it during all subsequent contacts with the complainant.

45The appellant said that it was the complainant who suggested that he should write cheques to her and postdate them, which he reluctantly did. He said that when he handed the cheques to her he told her not to present them until he confirmed that she should do so. The appellant said that the three payments he made to her of $750, $300 and $750 represented the amounts of the two cheques ($231 and $1526.50) that had bounced. The appellant said he did not know that she still had the two cheques. He said that by presenting the two cheques in March 2009, he believed that she was taking money that she was not entitled to. He said that he believed that he had a legal right to take the computer, modem and router. He said that the computer was only worth a few hundred dollars and had no real value to him (T.187). The appellant criticised the quality of the work performed by the complainant. He said that she was not very professional and almost incompetent.

46The appellant said that his claim of right also arose because the complainant told him that she no longer had the money. The appellant said that he suggested that she should pay him in alternative terms and he suggested the computers. The appellant said that the complainant responded to the effect ""If you think that's fair, that's fine"" (T.193). In cross-examination the appellant said that the agreement arrived at between him and the complainant concerning the computers was not that she would repay him in that way, but that she could repay him in that way (T.202).

47The appellant said that he and the complainant had been in dispute about her fees from the time when she presented him with the account for $4,526.50 on 22 April 2008. The appellant said that he believed the complainant was only entitled to charge what she had quoted in her retainer agreement and could not, without a new quote or further discussion with him, increase that amount. The appellant said that in all his discussions with Ms Theodor he had made it clear that he disputed that he owed the money being claimed by the complainant.

48The appellant said that he did not believe that he owed the complainant anything. His understanding was that once the company went into liquidation, it would have been illegal for him to pay her. He said that he had already paid the complainant for the work covered by the cheques which she re-presented. He did not cancel those cheques because he did not know that the complainant still had them. His understanding was that a bank would not return a cheque in circumstances where the cheque had not been met.

49The appellant said that he did not think that he was legally obliged to pay more than $3500 because that was the maximum amount set out in the complainant's retainer agreement. He said that he only paid more than $4000 because the complainant would not hand over documents otherwise.

50The appellant relied on the email of 24 June 2008 which he interpreted as indicating that if the complainant still believed she was owed money by him, she should seek a remedy through the liquidator of the company. In relation to the email of 26 June 2008 he said that this was sent by him to the complainant ""under duress"". Unless he sent the email, she would not do the further work which was urgently needed by the company.

51In relation to the assault charge, the appellant said that he was acting in self-defence because the complainant had become more and more agitated, was yelling and screaming and was attacking him and pushing him repeatedly. The appellant said that the complainant at one time had tried to put her hands around his throat. He denied ever pushing the complainant with his hands.

52The appellant said that he genuinely believed that he did not owe any money to the complainant and that she had wrongfully presented the cheques in March 2009 and that consequently, he was entitled to recover that money, or its equivalent, from her. He based that claim of right on the following specific aspects of his evidence.

(i) The complainant initially quoted $1500.

(ii) The complainant never indicated that that estimate would be exceeded.

(iii) He disputed the $4526.50 invoice as soon as she gave it to him.

(iv) He reluctantly handed over the three cheques and made it clear to the complainant not to cash the cheques because there was no money there and he was in dispute over the invoices.

(v) He told the complainant that he did not have any money and not to bank the cheques unless he said he had money and in the meantime, they were to try to resolve the issue over the quantum of the invoice.

(vi) He did not know that the complainant still had the cheques.

(vii) He had already paid the amount covered by the two cheques.

(viii) He raised with Ms Theodor on a number of occasions that he disputed the accounts and did not owe the money.

(ix) On a number of occasions he spoke to the complainant about it and they were in dispute about him owing her money.

(x) The laptop was second-hand and worth only a few hundred dollars.

Submissions and consideration
Ground of Appeal 1 - That the trial miscarried as a result of hearsay evidence being admitted.

53The hearsay evidence complained of is that set out at [26] hereof and at transcript T.54.3. The appellant submitted that this was important evidence which was prejudicial to him and as a result of it being given, a miscarriage of justice had occurred. He submitted that the unnamed technician was not a witness in the prosecution case, there was no statement from the technician served in the Crown brief, the complainant had made no mention of the technician in her statement to police and the trial judge had delivered an unambiguous direction to the complainant earlier about not giving evidence about what another person said. The appellant submitted that this evidence played an important part in the prosecution case in that it was used in the final address as evidence that the appellant continued to keep the computer and was treating it as if it were his own. The appellant submitted that if he had been given notice of this evidence, he could have called alibi evidence in his own case to show that he could not have been operating the computer.

54It was conceded by the appellant that counsel did not object to the evidence being given at the time and that consequently leave was needed under r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The appellant submitted that such leave should be given because the admission of this evidence in the context of the case meant that he lost a real chance, or a chance fairly open to him, of being acquitted (R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531).

55At this hearing the Crown was granted leave to file an affidavit of Janet Bremner, sworn 24 April 2012. That affidavit had annexed to it a Statement of Agreed Facts which was forwarded to the legal advisers of the appellant on 18 November 2009 by facsimile. That Statement of Agreed Facts included the following:

""On 16 March 2009 an unidentified person attended the victim's offices and returned the computer and modem/router and stated that they were from Owen Salmon. The victim's support person spent some time restoring the computer to working order and noted that her computer had been accessed and as a result was capable of being remotely accessed.""

56It follows that it is not correct to say that no notice was given that this evidence, or evidence of a similar kind, might be led by the Crown.

57An examination of the evidence makes it clear that all that was being raised was the possibility of the appellant remotely accessing the computer. The hearsay evidence only referred to ""someone"" operating the computer. Moreover, the complainant was cross-examined to the effect that she could not exclude the possibility that the technician, who had been at her office on the day of the confrontation with the appellant, (Mr Zhao who was called in the Crown case), might have activated the Blue Tooth on the laptop in the course of attempting to commission the replacement modem or router. She was also cross-examined to establish that when it was taken, despite having password protection, the laptop had been switched on and the ""time out period feature"" had been deactivated. These answers were consistent with the evidence of Mr Zhao that he had been trying for about 10 minutes to get the laptop to interact with the wireless router. Accordingly, the possibility that it was Mr Zhao who had activated the Blue Tooth in the course of his efforts to have the laptop interact with the wireless router was fairly and squarely raised in the proceedings and was equally open.

58It is true that the trial judge had earlier rejected the complainant giving hearsay evidence (T.47.07). That was a ruling made in response to an objection taken to another aspect of her evidence as hearsay. By contrast, when this evidence was given, no objection was taken.

59The absence of objection rendered the evidence admissible, because the phrase ""not admissible"" in s59(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) means not admissible over objection (Gonzales v R (2007) 178 A Crim R 232 at [21] - [26] per Giles JA (with whom Howie and Fullerton JJ agreed)) and the authorities therein referred to). 

60Not only was there no objection taken to the evidence, there was no defence application for the evidence to be withdrawn from the jury, for a voir dire on the evidence concerning the second technician, for the jury to be discharged or for directions to the jury concerning any alleged unreliability of that evidence by reason that it was hearsay, or for the Crown to be required to call the second technician. The evidence therefore remained available for inclusion in the final addresses.

61Counsel for the appellant at trial, provided an affidavit and was cross-examined by the appellant in these proceedings. In his affidavit he said that he could not recall why he did not object to this evidence, but having read his cross-examination of the complainant and of Mr Zhao ""It appears that I did not consider this evidence to be of any great significance"".

62Not only was that assessment of the effect of the evidence open to counsel for the appellant but it is, in my opinion, a reasonable assessment. The use of this evidence by the Crown in its summing up was limited to it being one of a number of indicia that the appellant had used the laptop as if it were his own. When making those submissions, the Crown advocate stressed that the most important indicators to that effect were the actual taking of the laptop by the appellant and his responses in his electronically recorded interview with the police. As can be seen from [40] hereof, in that interview the appellant's assertions as to ownership, or entitlement to possession of the laptop, were clear and unequivocal. 

63The submissions at trial on behalf of the appellant dealt with this evidence in two ways. It was submitted that the jury could not reliably conclude that the appellant had activated the Blue Tooth or otherwise done anything in relation to the laptop. Alternatively, it was submitted that if the jury thought that the appellant believed he was entitled to take the laptop, then his activation of the Blue Tooth would be fully consistent with that claim of right.

64To have called alibi evidence on such an issue would have focused attention upon it and given it an importance which it did not deserve. In any event, the suggested alibi evidence was not decisive in that the complainant, while generally believing that the laptop was returned to her on 16 March 2009, was not sure of that date. Her evidence left open the possibility that the laptop was returned on Friday 13 March (T.90.39). Similarly, the appellant's evidence was open to the same interpretation, i.e. that the laptop was returned on Friday 13 March (T.250.17 - T.251.05).

65Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the trial miscarried in the way asserted by the appellant by the admission of this evidence, nor am I satisfied that any miscarriage of justice occurred thereby. In a trial where the issues were comparatively simple and straightforward, the impugned evidence played but a peripheral role. I would not grant leave under rule 4 for this ground to be raised.

Ground of Appeal 2 - That the trial miscarried as a result of the Crown advocate putting to the jury that the appellant had lied in relation to twelve matters, none of which had been put to him in cross-examination. Separately the twelve lies appear substantially to have been misstated by the Crown advocate.

66The appellant submitted that the Crown advocate gave to the jury a list of ""twelve alleged lies"" to negate his claim of right defence. In his written submissions the appellant identified nine of the ""alleged lies"" and submitted that none of those matters had been put to him in cross-examination and in the case of five of the ""alleged lies"", that there was no basis in the evidence for such a submission.

67The appellant submitted that it was not made clear by the Crown advocate whether these ""alleged lies"" were being relied upon only to attack his credit or whether they were being relied upon to establish consciousness of guilt. The appellant submitted that regardless of the purpose, the submission as to lies would have adversely impacted upon the jury's assessment of his credit and as such, caused the trial to miscarry.

68The submission that the Crown did not make clear the purpose for which the lies would be relied upon is not made out. On two occasions (T.282.39, T.306.01-09) the Crown advocate made clear to the jury that the ""alleged lies"" were only relied upon on the question of the appellant's credibility. Her Honour also gave a direction to that effect (SU6.8-7.6).

69Contrary to the appellant's submission, there was cross-examination on all of the ""alleged lies"" sought to be relied upon by the Crown. This occurred as follows. 

There was cross-examination concerning the specific conversation between the appellant and complainant about her willingness to allow him to take her computer in part payment of the debt (T.245.06). There was cross-examination as to whether or not the appellant told Constable Fitzpatrick that he did not believe she was a police officer and as to other parts of his conversation with her (T.264.09, T.264.33).

The appellant was cross-examined as to his evidence that the bank told him that unpaid cheques would not be returned to the person presenting them for payment. (T.231.48)

The appellant was cross-examined about his evidence that the router and modem were placed in a cupboard near the complainant's office (T.251.39).

The appellant was cross-examined as to whether he touched or pushed the complainant while trying to remove the computer (T.261.31).

The appellant was cross-examined about telling the police that the task he asked the complainant to perform was a ""one off"" job (T.215.05).

70The Crown advocate was entitled to put before the jury the conflict in testimony between the appellant and these witnesses as going to his credit if the evidence of those witnesses were accepted. As the transcript reveals, those conflicts of evidence were fairly and squarely raised with the appellant in cross-examination. Similarly, the transcript makes clear that there was an evidentiary basis for the submission. There was no unfairness or miscarriage of justice in relation to those matters.

71The ""alleged lies"" concerning the relationship between the appellant and companies BACM and BACF and that the appellant had given an incorrect address to the police when interviewed, are in a different category. It is clear from the cross-examination of the appellant in relation to the companies, that the questions were ambiguous in that the word ""related"" was used. That word has a specific meaning in corporations law and the appellant's response to the questions, looked at in that way, was correct. Put at its highest, the Crown could have submitted that the appellant's answers on that issue were evasive, but not that he was lying.

72It is true that when asked for his address by the police during his interview, the appellant did not give his residential address. He gave an address to which his business correspondence was sent. In doing so, he was not telling a lie in that he had not then or subsequently been asked for his residential address. It was not open to the Crown to submit that the appellant had told a lie in relation to his address.

73Accordingly, the appellant has been successful in establishing that two of the twelve ""alleged lies"" should not have been put to the jury in that way. Simply put, there was no evidentiary basis for those submissions. The extent to which those submissions might have adversely impacted upon the jury's assessment of the appellant's credit, will be discussed later in these reasons.

Ground of Appeal 3 - Justice miscarried when her Honour failed to give a correct ruling on spent or old convictions.

74The appellant submitted that because credit was so important in this case, he intended to call character evidence from persons who had worked with him in the past as to his honesty and integrity. The Crown advocate advised that if this were done, the Crown would put before the jury offences which the appellant had committed in Victoria some 23 years ago when he was a teenager. The appellant also submitted that two of the four offences on the Crown's list, were not offences which he had committed.

75The appellant submitted that his counsel should have raised s579 of the Crimes Act 1900, which would have prevented the Crown from relying upon those old convictions and should have thereafter called character evidence in his case. The appellant submitted that the failure to call that character evidence at trial brought about a miscarriage of justice.

76The background to what occurred was this. When counsel for the appellant foreshadowed the calling of character evidence, the Crown advocate responded by saying that he would rely upon four previous convictions of the appellant which had occurred in Victoria over 23 years before. A discussion took place with the trial judge in the absence of the jury (T.103). In the course of that discussion, when the appellant's counsel raised with her Honour that because of their age these convictions were ""spent"" and could not be relied upon by the Crown, her Honour responded that she was not sure that that was correct and would appreciate being provided with some authority on the question. Nothing more was said on the subject. There was no application made then or at any subsequent time in the trial for any determination or ruling by the trial judge on that issue. The appellant's previous convictions were never put before the jury.

77In his affidavit and oral evidence, counsel for the appellant at trial made it clear that his decision not to call character evidence on behalf of the appellant was not made because he was afraid that these old convictions would be placed before the jury, but for another reason. That reason is discussed under another ground of appeal. 

78The fact of the appellant's previous convictions played no part in the trial. Accordingly, no miscarriage of justice occurred and this ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 4 - The trial miscarried when the learned trial judge failed to give adequate directions to the jury on real issues in the trial.

79This ground asserts that the trial miscarried because the trial judge failed to give adequate directions in relation to 19 pieces of evidence and law listed as (a)-(s) and referred to below. In none of those instances was any application made for further or remedial directions and accordingly leave is required pursuant to r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in respect of each of the issues raised in this ground, most of which can be conveniently grouped. I would refuse leave.

80(a) Her Honour failed to give directions of law to the jury regarding the legal obligations of an individual and a company.

(b) The trial miscarried when her Honour failed to give any direction on contract law, a crucial requirement in this case.

(o) Her Honour failed to prevent statements being given that contradicted the Corporations Act.

(p) That corporations law as the case was presented was a real issue that needed direction.

(q) Her Honour failed to uphold her own directions that there be no distinction between the company and the appellant.

(r) If corporations law had been correctly applied, the appellant's chance of acquittal would have been substantially improved.

The appellant submitted that her Honour should have given directions which made it clear to the jury that there was a distinction between the company and the appellant personally. The appellant submitted that her Honour should have made it clear that he considered that the agreement was between the complainant and the company, not with him personally.

81This was not how the case was run at trial. Although some questions were put to the complainant in cross-examination on this issue (see [27] hereof and T.65), counsel for the appellant when asked by her Honour eschewed any such distinction. In these proceedings he explained that decision in his affidavit and oral evidence as follows:

""71 In relation to paragraph 286 of the appellant's submissions I formed a view that the question whether the liability to pay Ms Hill's account was a personal liability or a company liability was irrelevant to the proceedings. The issue was Mr Salmon's subjective belief. Mr Salmon could not escape the fact that he had handed over personal cheques to Ms Hill. There was a factual issue concerning instructions to her about presenting the cheques but my view was that putting before the jury evidence about corporations law would be misleading, confusing and a waste of time.""

82In the proceedings before this Court, he said:

""HOEBEN JA: Q. Mr Hogan in case I forget, was it any part of your understanding of Mr Salmon's claim of right that the debt was in fact owed by one of his companies rather than by him personally? 
A. Yes, in the sense that the work was done for the company, but no in the sense that he had handed over a personal cheque. There was a tension between the two and it was another one of those areas that I thought risked raising a lot of irrelevant and confusing material. 

On the occasion that I tried to raise in a general way some concept of a corporate veil in cross-examining Miss Hill her Honour I think again made it clear that that wasn't an area that she thought was relevant to the case and I didn't think it had any great relevance at any rate.

Q. You didn't pursue it? 
A. Yes.

Q. I think that is where her Honour said something or other that she'd need to make a speech about company law etcetera? 
A. Yes, and that my, the very outline on the indication of what the concept of a proprietary limited company was just a thumb nail sketch and that there were all sorts of circumstances in which a director might well become personally liable for debts that were incurred by the company and that that wasn't going to take us anywhere usefully in the trial. "" (T.67.44-T.68.17)

83In the circumstances of this case, there was no requirement for her Honour to give directions of the kind suggested. The crucial element was the genuineness of the appellant's belief that he did not owe any money and whether or not the Crown had discharged its burden of disproving the genuineness of that belief.

84The issue in relation to this part of the Crown case was clear. The evidence of the complainant was that the appellant had agreed to pay personally for her work (T.5.38, T.19.21, T.65.01, T.65.47, T.81.15, T.81.37). The evidence of the appellant was that he did not so agree and had only given the written undertaking to pay as a director on behalf of the company, and even then only under duress (T.240.14). Such evidence put the issue starkly before the jury without the necessity for further directions concerning the law of contract or corporations law.

85Counsel for the appellant in final addresses referred to the appellant's belief that the debt was owed by the company and not him personally. Her Honour made it clear in her summing up that while the claim of right had to be based on a genuine belief, that belief did not itself have to be legally correct (SU19.8). Those directions were appropriate, irrespective of whether the jury had a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that no monies at all were owing to the complainant or that any monies in fact owing, were owed by the company and not him personally. Because of the claim of right defence, it was unnecessary for the jury to resolve ultimately whether any debt was actually owed to the complainant, or indeed whether such a debt was owed by the company, rather than by the appellant personally.

86No further directions were required than those which were given by her Honour.

87(c) The trial miscarried when the learned judge failed to give the jury proper instruction on the law of claim of right.

The appellant submitted that her Honour ought to have directed the jury that as part of his claim of right, he was entitled to use force to obtain the goods in its legitimate exercise.

88This submission misunderstands the issues which arose at trial. The Crown case was that in the presence of Ms Theodor and Mr Zhao, the appellant first assaulted the complainant and then robbed her of the laptop. The appellant's case was that there was no assault and that the laptop was taken by consent, pursuant to an agreement with the complainant, but that he had to remove the hands of the complainant from around his neck. Alternatively, he had a right to take the laptop because the complainant had wrongfully deprived him of his money when she had cashed the two cheques.

89Having regard to the Crown case on counts 2 and 3, and the defence case in response, it would have been counterproductive to have sought directions of an alternative defence scenario, i.e. that the appellant might have been exercising his claim of right with substantially greater force than that to which he admitted in his police interview and in his evidence.

90No further direction along the lines suggested by the appellant was required to be given by her Honour.

91(d) The Judge misdirected the jury at T.23/24 in summing up by stating
that if the appellant had the intention at the time of the taking, that he would return the goods at a later time, he would be entitled to be found not guilty as he had not intended to permanently deprive the owner. In this respect the formulation at T.17 may be a correct direction but the formulation at T.23-24 is a misdirection.

92The appellant submitted that the directions to which he referred were mutually inconsistent with the first direction being correct and the second being incorrect.

93This submission is not made out. Both directions are correct and convey the same meaning. The impugned direction was:

""As I have already told you, if you found that the accused took the property intending to take ownership of it but contemplated that later he might return it that, of itself, does not entitle him to be found not guilty of this charge. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time he took the laptop he intended to take it for his own benefit, even if he contemplated that maybe he may return it, then the Crown has established this element beyond reasonable doubt."" 

There is no error in this direction.

94(e) The learned judge gave a misdirection at T.10-11 by stating ""When the accused pushed and shouldered Ms Hill, that it was deliberate"". This makes the assumption that the appellant did push and shoulder Ms Hill. That was a major fact in dispute. Therefore it was a wrong direction to assume that the appellant did in fact push and shoulder her.

(i) Her Honour at T.9 misdirects the jury regarding the two-handed push.

(m) Her Honour did not sufficiently explain the assault elements to cover the evidence given in this trial.

The appellant submitted that her Honour summed up too favourably for the prosecution in relation to what she said concerning evidence going to the assault. He submitted that in part her Honour's direction assumed that he had in fact pushed the complainant and that her Honour described the push in a way which went beyond the evidence.

95Her Honour provided a written direction to the jury which set out the elements which the Crown had to prove in order to establish the offence of assault. In her summing up her Honour explained the written direction. When explaining the third element, i.e. that the acts were intentional, it was necessary for her Honour to make clear to the jury the temporal element in the offence, i.e. that the necessary intent had to be present at the time of the physical contact between the appellant and the complainant. It was in that context that her Honour used the word ""when"". There was no defect in her Honour's direction on the assault issue.

96Furthermore, very shortly after her Honour's reference to 'when' and which is the subject of complaint, her Honour stated 'the accused denies that he pushed Ms Hill as she said, but agrees that he did touch her'. In light of this, the jury could not possibly have concluded that her Honour was pre-judging or assuming that the appellant in fact pushed and shouldered Ms Hill.

97(g) That her Honour failed to caution the jury against drawing an inference that the accused was making things up when counsel failed to re-examine the accused after the accused's evidence contradicted with that of his opening remarks.

The appellant submitted that there was a contradiction between what his counsel said in the opening and the evidence which he gave. He submitted that her Honour should have warned the jury against drawing an adverse inference because of that contradiction. No point was taken by the Crown as to any such contradiction. Accordingly, even if a contradiction existed (which the appellant has not identified) there was no proper basis for her Honour to give such a direction.

98(h) Her Honour failed to give the jury a direction on alibi.

There was no evidence at trial which warranted an alibi direction.

99(j) Her Honour failed to direct the jury there must be violence or threat of violence which induces the victim to part with the property.

In relation to the robbery offence, the appellant submitted that not only should her Honour have given the direction specified, but she should have given a direction that if violence occurred after the property was taken, this would not amount to robbery. The background to this submission was the evidence of Mr Zhao that the pushing by the appellant occurred after he picked up the laptop.

100The written direction provided by her Honour, setting out the elements of the offence of robbery, was orthodox and correct. Her Honour explained each element of the offence in her summing up. In circumstances such as occurred here, where it was common ground that the complainant attempted to prevent the taking of the laptop, no relevant directions were omitted by her Honour.

101(k) That the larceny direction was not correct in the circumstances.

The appellant submitted that her Honour failed to direct the jury that for the offence of larceny to occur, the property ""must be taken and carried away"". The appellant submitted that the taking by him of the modem and router and placing it nearby in a cupboard, could not amount to larceny.

102As her Honour explained, the larceny offence required the taking of the goods without the complainant's consent with the intention of taking ownership of the property. Each of those elements was explained in detail, both in writing and orally, by her Honour. No further direction was required.

103(l) That her Honour misstated the evidence to the jury in summing up.

(n) Her Honour exhibited bias throughout the trial against the accused.

The appellant submitted that in her summing up, her Honour stressed the evidence which favoured the Crown and did not adequately or at all mention the evidence which favoured him. A fair reading of her Honour's summing up does not support this complaint.

104(s) Her Honour failed to give any direction on demeanour.

The appellant submitted that her Honour should have given the jury a direction as to demeanour because the Crown advocate directed the jury's attention to ""the way he gave his evidence"". 

105It is clear that the Crown advocate was inviting attention to the demeanour of the appellant as it impinged upon his credibility. In her summing up, her Honour said:

""That a witness has inconsistencies in his or her evidence does not automatically mean that he or she is unreliable. Reliability is an assessment that you make based on, not only what the witness said, but how he or she presented it, how he or she appeared in the witness box and how the evidence of that witness appears in the light of the other evidence in the case. All of those matters are appropriate and relevant for you to take into account in determining the reliability of a witness."" (SU 5.2)

Nothing further was required of her Honour by way of direction.

Ground of Appeal 5 - The trial miscarried when the learned trial judge allowed inadmissible police statements into evidence in breach of s33.

106The appellant submitted that the statements of Senior Constable Murphy, Constable Eastham and Senior Constable Fitzpatrick were wrongly admitted contrary to s33 of the Evidence Act 1995 and that his counsel failed to carry out instructions to object to the admission of these statements.

107Relevant in that connection is the fact that s 33 precludes a police officer reading his or her statement unless, inter alia, ""the statement was made by the police officer at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers"". The statements the subject of this ground of appeal were made:

(1) In the case of Senior Constable Murphy, on 12 April 2009, 31 days after its subject matter.

(2) Constable Eastham, on 25 March 2009, 13 days after its subject matter.

(3) Senior Constable Fitzpatrick, on 27 March 2009, 15 days after its subject matter.

108In Orchard v Spooner (1992) 28 NSWLR 114 it was suggested that a forerunner of the section in relevantly identical terms contemplated a statement made within days rather than weeks of the events. For my part, I would not regard any of the three statements mentioned as made, as s 33 requires, ""at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers"".

109Senior Constable Murphy's statement was very short. In it he said that he had attended on the premises, met the complainant who was heavily pregnant and very upset, that she had said that a male had entered and demanded money, then had become aggressive and pushed her with 2 hands backwards forcing her to the rear of the office, then had picked up the victim's laptop, a short struggle occurred and then the male had walked out of the premises with the laptop.

110Senior Constable Eastham's statement was not short but it dealt with the arrest of the appellant, his wanting to report being assaulted, discussions with the appellant about his being interviewed, requests to the latter concerning whether he wished to obtain legal advice and attempts he made to do so and then the occurrence but not the contents of the interview. It was, in terms of the appellant's guilt, innocuous.

111Senior Constable Fitzpatrick's evidence covered a number of topics including conversations with Ms Hill, Ms Theodore and the accused. Some of this evidence certainly tended to incriminate the appellant.

112On the other hand, a deal of it, particularly the incriminating parts, accorded with evidence that the accused himself gave. Furthermore, Constable Fitzpatrick's evidence included the statement that some of what she said had been recorded in her police notebook. One may infer that this was earlier than her statement of 27 March and very probably at about the time events occurred. However the extent of such recording was not explored in detail in evidence at the trial or in the appeal.

113Reference should also be made to s 32 of the Evidence Act which permits a witness, with the leave of the Court, to refresh his or her memory from a document. In deciding whether to grant such leave it is relevant for the judge to consider whether when events were recorded in a statement, they were fresh in the witness' memory but that is not a pre-condition for allowing a statement to be used. Although without more concrete information than is available to this Court, one cannot be sure what a judge would have done, the matters to which I have referred lead me to the view that probably some refreshing would have been allowed.

114In the result, while I regard the reading of their statements by these police officers as an error in the trial, it was an error having little or no significance.

Ground of Appeal 6 - Justice miscarried when ""prejudicial information was continually stated to the jury"".

115The appellant submitted that the evidence of the complainant's advanced pregnancy was irrelevant and prejudicial to him in that it was designed to create sympathy for the complainant. He submitted that this evidence should have been excluded by the operation of s137 of the Evidence Act.

116The fact of the complainant's advanced pregnancy was necessary to explain a number of actions of the complainant, e.g. calling the police after the first visit by the appellant to her office, why she did not further pursue the appellant down the stairs when he had raised his arm as if to hit her and as to why she had not been the aggressor in her confrontation with the appellant. Ms Theodor gave the evidence to explain calling the police. Mr Zhao made repeated references to the pregnancy as a means of distinguishing the complainant from Ms Theodor. Constable Murphy and Senior Constable Fitzpatrick were also able to differentiate the complainant from Ms Theodor by reference to her pregnancy.

117No objection was taken by the defence to evidence of the complainant's pregnancy. The Crown referred to the fact of the complainant's pregnancy to negative that part of the appellant's evidence that she had tried to push him down the stairs after he left the office. 

118That the complainant was over six and a half months pregnant was an undisputed fact in the trial. It explains part of her conduct. It was otherwise relevant to issues raised by the defence. It was appropriate that the jury be made aware of this fact. In the circumstances, the evidence was not prejudicial in the sense relied upon by the appellant and the communication of that fact to the jury caused no miscarriage of justice.

Ground of Appeal 7 - For count 3, the verdict was unsafe given new evidence and correct direction on the elements of the offence.

119The appellant repeated the submissions already made that for robbery to have occurred ""there must be violence or threat of violence which induces the victim to part with the property taken. It is not sufficient if there was violence or threat thereof made after the property was taken"". The appellant submitted that on the evidence, the elements of count 3 were not made out. The appellant also sought to rely upon additional evidence.

120The Crown's case in relation to count 3 alleged that the appellant took the laptop from the desk in the presence of the complainant, who attempted to prevent him from doing so by taking hold of the laptop. The appellant then swung the laptop around so that the complainant also twisted around from side to side as she held onto the laptop in an effort to prevent the appellant taking it. All of the evidence in the Crown case (the complainant, Ms Theodor and Mr Zhao) supported that sequence of events. The Crown case was thereby capable of properly making out the offence of robbery. There was nothing unsafe in the jury accepting that evidence and finding the offence proved.

121The new evidence sought to be relied upon by the appellant under this ground of appeal is irrelevant. It comprises a substantial quantity of material relating to professional standards and ethics of accountants (96 pages). It can have no probative effect on any part of the Crown evidence which went to establish count 3.

122This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 8 - A substantial miscarriage of justice occurred when the Crown misconducted himself in the trial.

123In support of this submission, the appellant set out 33 pieces of transcript which he submitted involved a misstatement of the evidence. The appellant made a number of further submissions, all of which had been raised earlier by him and which have been dealt with in these reasons. None of these issues were raised at trial and so leave pursuant to rule 4 is required. I would refuse leave except for items (ff) and (gg) which have already been referred to at [71] - [73] hereof.

124The appellant raised the following ""misstatements of the evidence"".

(a) T.200.28 - The appellant agreed with the proposition put.

(b) T.244.4 - The appellant agreed with the proposition put.

(c) T.249.22 - The appellant agreed with the proposition put.

(d) T.293.5-6 - There was a proper evidentiary basis for this statement.

(e) T.293.7 - There was a proper evidentiary basis for this statement.

(f) T.296.24 - There was a proper evidentiary basis for this statement.

(g) T.296.30 - There was a proper evidentiary basis for this question.

(h) T.304.2 - There was some imprecision in this statement, but otherwise there was a proper evidentiary basis for putting it.

(i) T.304 - There was a proper evidentiary basis for this statement. It was the Crown case that the complainant had been trying for some time prior to the re-presentation of the cheques to contact the appellant to obtain payment of the account.

(j) T.106.47 - There was an evidentiary basis for this question.

(k)-(l) T.215.33 - The terms ""guarantee"" and ""undertaking"" were used interchangeably in this trial to refer to both the oral agreement which the appellant had initially made with the complainant that he would pay her fees as well as the written undertaking he gave in the email of 26 June 2008. There would have been no misunderstanding on the jury's part.

(m) T.292.42 - The appellant agreed with this proposition.

(n) T.293.13 - There is an evidentiary basis for this submission.

(o) T.294.25 
(p) T.294.42 - There is an evidentiary basis for those submissions.

(q) T.295.6 - The evidence of Mr Zhao was that the appellant took the laptop and then both he and the complainant were pushing each other and then the appellant was pushing her away to leave through the door. In those circumstances it was open to the Crown to submit that the evidence of Mr Zhao portrayed the appellant as the aggressor.

(r) T.295.3 - There was an evidentiary basis for this submission.

(s) T.296.41 - There was an evidentiary basis for this submission. Although every contact between the complainant and the appellant was not documented, most contacts were and the documentation favoured the Crown case.

(t) T.294.22
(u) T.297.27
(v) T.297.17
(w) T.297.43
(x) T.297.48 - These references raise the same issue. There is a clear evidentiary basis for the submission made.

(y) T.298.20 - The substance of the Crown submission was that the complainant understood that the appellant was responsible for her professional fees from the first meeting because he had informed her of the financial circumstances of the company. The reference to the ""books"" was inaccurate but had no effect on the entitlement of the Crown to put the submission.

(z) T.298.31 - There was an evidentiary basis for this submission.

(aa) T.298.40 - As previously indicated, the words ""guarantee"" and ""undertaking"" were used interchangeably in the trial in circumstances where there could have been no misunderstanding as to what was meant on the part of the jury. They were references to evidence that the appellant undertook to pay the complainant's fees personally.

(bb) T.301.18 - There was an evidentiary basis for this submission.

(cc) T.301.44 - This was a submission open to the Crown. It referred to what the Crown said was evasiveness on the part of the appellant in answering some questions.

(dd) T.303.11 - This evidence emerged under cross-examination and the Crown was entitled to make a submission in relation to it.

(ee) T.303.22 - Both Ms Theodor and Mr Zhao gave evidence which would support this submission (T.107.20, T.152.01).

(ff) T.304.5 - The appellant's complaint is justified. The Crown was not entitled to submit that the responses which the appellant gave in respect of the companies BACF and BACM were untrue.

(gg) T.305.2 - The appellant's complaint is justified. It was not open to the Crown to submit that the appellant's response to the police when his address was requested was not true.

Ground of Appeal 9 - A miscarriage of justice occurred when both the defence solicitor and counsel failed to take any direction before or during the trial.

125The appellant submitted that his legal representation at trial was ""woefully inadequate"" and as a result, he did not receive a fair trial. He specifically complained of a failure to take and follow instructions, that critical documents were not obtained or considered, and that there was a failure to take appropriate objections to evidence in the Crown case.

126The appellant's dissatisfaction with his legal representation at trial is a theme which runs throughout all his Grounds of Appeal. Affidavits were provided by Mr Shukla, the instructing solicitor, and by Mr Hogan, counsel who represented the appellant at the trial. Both Mr Shukla and Mr Hogan were cross-examined by the appellant. I found Messrs Shukla and Hogan to be impressive witnesses. They were honest and to the best of their ability endeavoured to assist the Court by setting out what occurred between them and the appellant before and during the trial. While their recollections were not perfect as to every detail, it was quite apparent from their evidence that each of them had a generally good recollection of what occurred at trial and were reliable witnesses. Unless otherwise indicated, I accept the evidence of Messrs Shukla and Hogan.

127Before dealing with specific submissions by the appellant, it is useful to set out the principles applicable to a ground of appeal raising incompetence of counsel. In Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113 Simpson J, with whom Hoeben and Price JJ agreed, said -

""[155] The principles applicable to the determination of a ground of appeal raising alleged incompetence of counsel were settled in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. Those principles include - 

'2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.' (p 685, per Gleeson CJ) 

[156] Earlier, Gleeson CJ had said - 

'As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case.' (p 683) 

[157] The Chief Justice cited, and plainly accepted, a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, Vol 3(1), par 518 at 420 which is in the following terms - 

'... a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted. Unless and until his instructions are withdrawn, counsel has, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best for the interests of his client. This authority extends to all matters relating to the action, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, challenging a juror, deciding what points to take, choosing which of two inconsistent defences to put forward, and even to agreeing to a compromise of the action, or to a verdict, order or judgment.' (p 684) 

[158] The decision in Birks was essentially endorsed by the High Court in TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124. There, Gleeson CJ said - 

'16 It is undesirable to attempt to be categorical about what might make unfair an otherwise regularly conducted trial. But, in the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise. And it is not the role of a Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such decisions in order to decide whether they were made after the fullest possible examination of all material considerations. Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks.'"" 

128Hunt CJ at CL made observations to similar effect in Ignjatic v R (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 336 - 
""Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to which witnesses should or should not be called, what questions should or should not be asked, which lines of argument should be pursued, which points should be abandoned and which of two or more inconsistent defences should be raised are all matters within the discretion of counsel, and they frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to the best tactics to be adopted. Neither disobedience of instructions or even incompetence is sufficient of itself to attract appellate intervention. It is only when the error made was of such a nature in the circumstance of the case as to have led to a miscarriage of justice that this court will interfere."" 
129In applying those principles, it is clear that the task facing counsel at trial was a difficult one. The appellant wanted the trial to run on the basis of a wide-ranging inquiry into the professional ethics and practices of the complainant. He also wished to raise matters based on his understanding of corporations law such as the proposition that once the company went into liquidation, he was not, as a matter of law, allowed to pay the complainant even if he had given a personal undertaking to do so. The appellant wished to give evidence as to matters of law based on his knowledge and experience with corporations law.

130Counsel on the other hand, wished to run the trial differently. In his affidavit, he said:

""5. Essentially this was a very simple trial. The appellant's defence to the robbery and larceny charges was that he believed that he did not owe Ms Hill the money she obtained from him by presenting the two cheques that had previously been dishonoured (the ""claim of right""). His defence to the assault charge was that any force he applied to her was limited to removing her hands when she took hold of him (self-defence).

6. In preparing and conducting the trial I was conscious of the need to confine the evidence in the trial to matters relevant to the issues in dispute. In addition to considering my duty to the court in this respect, in my experience juries respond better to a defence which is confined as much as possible to well defined and limited issues.

7. Mr Salmon was a particularly difficult client in the sense that his instructions often involved material that went outside matters relevant to these limited issues. There was a constant tension in my dealings with him between his instructions and my view of what was relevant to the proceedings.""

131The approach to the trial advocated by counsel was a sensible and realistic one and he was justified in rejecting the approach which the appellant wished to follow. Counsel's decision as to how to run the trial, and his decisions as to when to take objection and when not, such as allowing parts of the police statements to be read, were all within the wide authority which he had to act in the best interests of his client.

132There were, however, two instances where counsel erred. The first has already been identified, i.e. the failure to object to the Crown asserting in addresses that the appellant had told lies about the companies BACF and BACM and about his residential address. The other error occurred when counsel decided not to call character evidence on behalf of the appellant for fear that the question of the appellant's credibility would be raised on the basis that he did not give a correct address, not only by the Crown but also by her Honour. The circumstances in which that error occurred and the effect of those errors are dealt with later in these reasons.

133With the exception of those two instances, the decisions made by counsel in the conduct of the trial were within his authority and it has not been shown were not thought to be or in fact in the best interests of the appellant. Subject to the two issues identified, this ground of appeal has otherwise not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 10 - Justice miscarried when her Honour revoked the accused's bail mid trial and prevented a fair trial being run.

134The appellant submitted that her Honour's revocation of bail on the third day of the trial (10.12.2009), prevented a fair trial in that he was placed in remand overnight, where it was almost impossible to sleep, all of his documents were taken from him and when he gave evidence the following day, he had not showered or had a change of clothing and was not in a fit state to give evidence. He submitted that the most significant disadvantage imposed on him was his inability to access ""the extensive documentation that underpins many aspects of this case"" (appellant's Written Submissions par 296).

135It is difficult for this Court to accurately assess what occurred during the trial merely from the transcript. Something may have happened which her Honour observed, but which is not apparent from the transcript which led to her Honour forming the belief that she had been deliberately deceived by the appellant in relation to his residential address. From a simple reading of the transcript, however, the only inference available is that her Honour was not justified in revoking bail and that she was operating under some kind of misunderstanding when she did so.

136In the absence of the jury, the following exchange took place (T.171):

""HER HONOUR: Mr Hogan I think I might impose a variation on your client's bail.

HOGAN: Yes your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Does he have a residential requirement in his present bail?

HOGAN: I can't help you with that your Honour. If you would just excuse me. No apparently he doesn't. 

HER HONOUR: His present address is - ?

HOGAN: Suite 245, 91 Longueville Road, Lane Cove.

HER HONOUR: Is that a residential address?

HOGAN: Yes your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Mr Hogan given that the witnesses are all from that area, I am going to make a variation to your client's bail that after leaving court he is not to go to the Lane Cove shopping precincts, not to approach any witnesses or go within 500 metres of Ms Hill's business premises.

HOGAN: Can your Honour just let me make sure that - because I think both of her addresses are on Longueville Road aren't they?

HER HONOUR: Yes but I thought your client said 91 didn't he?

HOGAN: Yes that's what I want to check that there's no chance that it's within 500 metres.

HER HONOUR: Yes please do.

HOGAN: Your Honour I'm sorry that this is so complicated. It's complicated because Mr Salmon has clarified that is not a residential address -

HER HONOUR: So my direct question which was ""Is that a residential address?"" and his answer ""Yes"", that was wrong?

HOGAN: Yes.

HER HONOUR: Shall I revoke his bail so we all know where he lives, Mr Hogan?""

Later in submissions to her Honour, counsel said: (T.172.20)

""HOGAN: The accused tells me that when I was indicating that that was a residential address he was trying to get my attention to indicate that it wasn't. Your Honour saw what your Honour saw from where your Honour sits and your Honour can assess that submission in light of what your Honour observed. He tells me your Honour, and I'm almost hesitant to do this from the bar table and I wonder whether it might be preferable to call him rather than me ...""

137Whether her Honour saw something from the bench, which does not appear on the transcript is not clear. What the transcript records is that a mistake was made by counsel in responding to her Honour's question, which was corrected by the appellant within a minute or so of the mistake being made. If nothing else happened other than that which is reflected in the transcript, it seems clear that her Honour was not justified in revoking the appellant's bail.

138That, however, does not end the matter. Despite the assertions by the appellant that his ability to give evidence the next day was seriously interfered with, he made no complaint to counsel to that effect. Had he done so it was counsel's evidence (which I accept) that he would have applied for an adjournment.

""Q. I say to you that severely corrupted my preparation for cross-examination?
A. If I had thought you weren't in a fit emotional state to give evidence, I would have made the application I foreshadowed on page 174 of the afternoon before.

Q. Could that have affected my demeanour evidence though after six hours in the witness box? 
A. Yes it could have."" (T.63.39)

139It was clearly most regrettable that the appellant's bail was revoked in the way in which it was during the trial. It should be noted, however, that her Honour delayed the start of the trial the following day to 11am to enable the appellant to ""spruce himself up"" so as to be ready to give evidence (T.174.15 -.38). Even though the appellant was inconvenienced in this way, there was nothing in his answers under cross-examination to indicate that he was unable to properly answer questions. I am not satisfied that the revocation of the appellant's bail overnight on 10.12.2009 led to a miscarriage of justice.

Ground of Appeal 11 - Justice miscarried when her Honour prevented crucial evidence being adduced by the accused and defence counsel in breach of s79 of the Evidence Act.

140The appellant submitted that he was prevented by rulings of the trial judge from giving evidence about accounting practices, banking practices and policies, debt recovery, corporations law and other related matters although he was sufficiently qualified to do so, either by reason of his relevant business experience or academic qualifications. 

141The appellant also wished to rely upon additional evidence in support of this ground of appeal, being the Chartered Accountants' Code of Conduct setting out standards to be observed by chartered accountants. The purpose of the foreshadowed oral evidence from the appellant and of this additional evidence was to demonstrate that the complainant had acted unethically in rendering accounts to the appellant and that consequently, he did not owe her any money. The appellant intended to rely upon these matters as part of his defence of claim of right.

142At an early point in the trial, her Honour queried the relevance of evidence about corporation law and counsel for the defendant agreed that its relevance was marginal and did not pursue that issue further at trial. As a result, there was no application made at trial for the appellant to be permitted to give opinion evidence concerning accounting practices, and/or banking and/or corporation law. Accordingly, it cannot be said that her Honour ruled against or prevented evidence being adduced by the appellant on these issues.

143As previously indicated, counsel's assessment that such matters were irrelevant and should not be pursued was reasonable and was within the broad authority which he had to conduct the trial on behalf of the appellant. Apart from the assertion that the debt was not owed personally by the appellant to the complainant, it is difficult to see how these additional matters were relevant to the issues at trial and the counts with which the appellant was charged.

144In the course of the hearing before this Court, the appellant set out his qualifications - a certificate in banking finance and a Master of Business Administration. He has also had dealings over the years with many chartered accountants. With those qualifications it is doubtful whether, in any event, the appellant would have been qualified to give expert evidence about accounting practices or corporations law. Despite lack of qualifications, the appellant did give evidence in the trial as to banking practice in relation to the return of cheques (T.189.34, T.231.44) and as to his opinion on what he referred to as ""insolvent transactions"" (T.272.33).

145This ground of appeal should be rejected. No application to give the evidence referred to by the appellant was made at trial. This was a reasonable decision which was open to his counsel. Even if the evidence had been given, its relevance was marginal at best. In any event, the appellant did succeed in giving some of that opinion evidence.

Ground of Appeal 12 - Based on ""new"" evidence from ICAA, the convictions are unreasonable and unsupported, having regard to all the evidence.

146The appellant again sought leave to tender additional evidence to support this ground of appeal. The additional evidence was:

(a) The ICAA (Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia) Members' Handbook.

(b) The APESB (Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board) Terms of Engagement.

(c) The ICAA Guidelines relating to the ownership, possession and disclosure of documents and records.

(d) The ICAA Guidelines as to the rendering of fees.

The appellant submitted that an analysis of these documents showed that the complainant was in breach of these guidelines and standards. The appellant referred specifically to the various accounts which the complainant rendered to him and the way in which those accounts were calculated. These documents, the appellant submitted, went to establish that he did not owe any monies to the complainant and that because the complainant's conduct was unethical, she was not a person who could be believed.

147Since this ground of appeal depends entirely upon the appellant being granted leave to rely upon this evidence in the appeal, it provides a useful opportunity to deal with all of the additional evidence sought to be relied upon by the appellant. Apart from the accounting documents referred to above, the other additional evidence sought to be relied upon by the appellant can be categorised as follows:

(i) ASIC printouts concerning the company, BACM Pty Limited, BACF Pty Limited.
(ii) Correspondence with the Police Integrity Commission.
(iii) An affidavit of Ms Magoulias, 16 November 2011.
(iv) Degrees and diplomas earned by the appellant.
(v) A profit and loss statement of the company for the year ended 30 June 2007.
(vi) An affidavit of the appellant setting out his qualifications and business experience.
(vii) Judgment of Court of Criminal Appeal in Salmon v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 83 (refusal of application to review refusal of bail).
(viii) Affidavit of Robert Charter, sworn 17 November 2011, affidavit John Williams, sworn 30 November 2011.

148Before dealing with each item of additional evidence, it is important to set out the relevant principles for the admission of such evidence on appeal.

149A preliminary, but important issue is whether any of the material constitutes ""fresh evidence"". The principles on which fresh evidence may be admitted on a conviction appeal have been considered on a number of occasions: R v Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392, Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259; R v Abou-Chabake [2004] 149 A Crim R 417 and GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163 at [26]. 

150For evidence to be fresh, it must be evidence that was not available at the time of trial. It is not contended by the appellant that any of the material upon which he now seeks to rely (except for the bail judgment) was not in existence or was not within his knowledge, or not available, for use at trial. The real complaint is that his counsel or the Crown did not adduce the evidence or chose not to rely upon it. 

151In Gallagher the following statement of principle by Rich and Dixon JJ in Craig v The King (1933) 49 CLR 429 at 439 was referred to with approval - 
""A Court of Criminal Appeal has thrown upon it some responsibility of examining the probative value of the fresh evidence. It cannot be said that that a miscarriage has occurred unless the fresh evidence has cogency and plausibility, as well as relevancy. The fresh evidence must, we think, be of such a character that, if considered in combination with the evidence already given upon the trial the result ought in the minds of reasonable men be affected. Such evidence should be calculated at least to remove the certainty of the prisoner's guilt which the former evidence produced. But in judging of the weight of the fresh testimony the probative force and the nature of the evidence already adduced at the trial must be a matter of great importance."" 

152In Mickelberg the test was expressed at 310 as - 
""There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground for a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be ""credible"", ""cogent"", ""relevant"", ""plausible"": See, e.g. Gallagher ; Craig v The King ; Ratten ; Lawless. In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it ( Gallagher , per Brennan J). Or, if there be a practical difference, that there is ""a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the [accused]"". ( Gallagher , per Gibbs CJ and per Mason and Deane JJ)."" (footnotes omitted) 
153Leaving aside that the proposed additional evidence is not fresh, there are other reasons why its tender should be rejected. Most of it is irrelevant. It lacks the cogency which would have enabled it to have had any effect on the outcome of the trial.

154The issue raised at trial did not depend upon whether or not the complainant had adhered to professional standards in her dealings with the appellant. They turned on the acceptance or otherwise by the jury of the complainant's evidence that the appellant had consistently told her that he would be personally responsible for her fees.

155Except for the affidavit of Mr Charter, none of the material is relevant to issues properly raised on this appeal. Most of the material relates to the appellant's complaint that counsel did not conduct his defence in accordance with his instructions and did not raise accounting and corporation issues. Other parts of the additional evidence seem to go to issues which were raised in the trial, but do not take those issues further. The affidavit of Ms Magoulias is to the effect that in about August 2008, she had a conversation with Ms Theodor and told her (on instructions from the appellant) that the appellant did not owe any money to the complainant. That evidence accords with the evidence of Ms Theodor which was that the first time that she became aware that the appellant was disputing his obligations to pay the account was in August 2008.

156Accordingly, I would reject the additional evidence except for the affidavit of Mr Charter. I propose to admit that affidavit because it is in the form of a testimonial as to the appellant's good character and it gives an indication of the evidence which could have been called on the appellant's behalf as to his character. That is a matter which is dealt with later in these reasons.

Ground of Appeal 13 - In relation to a claim of right that the convictions are unreasonable in the circumstances.

157The appellant submitted that the jury's finding against him on the claim of right issue was contrary to the evidence and unreasonable. He submitted that the submissions made by the Crown as to his credibility were false and must have led to the jury rejecting his claim of right. The appellant submitted that his behaviour in March 2009 in demanding the return of the proceeds from the cashed cheques and in attending the office of the complainant for that purpose, was only consistent with a genuine belief on his part that no money was owed by him to the complainant and that the money from the cashed cheques had been wrongfully taken by her.

158The appellant's claim of right defence was only relevant to counts 1 and 3. It was not a question of whether the jury believed the complainant in preference to the appellant in relation to the claim of right. The question was whether the Crown had negatived this defence, i.e. had persuaded the jury to the necessary standard that the appellant did not genuinely hold such a belief at the time that offences 1 and 3 occurred.

159There was ample evidence, if accepted by the jury, to establish the Crown case and to rebut the claim of right defence. There was the evidence of the complaint and Ms Theodor, there was the undertaking given by the appellant and there were the cash payments and personal cheques provided by the appellant to the complainant. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground of Appeal 14 - In the context of the previous thirteen appeal grounds, the verdicts in this matter are unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.

160By this ground of appeal the appellant relied upon all of the previous matters which he had raised and submitted that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence (s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912).

161Having reviewed all of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant, the only two issues which have been established are:

(i) That the Crown should not have been allowed to submit in addresses that the appellant had told lies in relation to his address and in relation to his relationship with the companies BACF and BACM.

(ii) That his counsel erred in deciding that he should not call character evidence in the appellant's case.

162Some further explanation is required in relation to counsel's decision not to call character evidence. Counsel explained that decision in his affidavit and oral evidence as follows:

""11 I cannot specifically remember what details Mr Salmon had provided relating to character witnesses but I do not doubt that he provided character references. It would commonly be my practice to confer with character witnesses shortly before they were to give evidence in order to minimise inconvenience to them, particularly if I had been provided with written testimonials or proofs of evidence.

12 The events of the afternoon of 10 December where the trial judge expressed the view that the appellant deliberately misled her about his residential address in the course of the discussion about his bail conditions (at page 171) raised what I considered to be a much more significant issue in relation to Mr Salmon's character. 

13 Without the benefit of any notes from the time I cannot be certain about any discussion I had with Mr Salmon about this issue after 10 December. I remember having some discussion with the Crown about the significance of the events of 10 December. I also remember having a discussion with Mr Salmon while he remained in the dock. His presence in the dock during such a discussion is most consistent with it taking place on the morning of 11 December during the period in which his bail was revoked.

14 My best recollection is that I had formed a view that any evidence of his good character would now be met by evidence that he had intentionally misled the Court during the course of the proceedings - evidence which may well have been fatal to any assessment of his character and credibility. The strength with which her Honour had indicated her perception of what had taken place is consistent with me coming to the conclusion that there was nothing to be gained by further ventilating the issue before her. On that basis I believe that I formed the view that there was no forensic benefit to be gained by adducing evidence of his good character and that I indicated to Mr Salmon that I would not raise evidence of his character.""

""Q. That was certainly correct. You don't seem to have pursued that with her Honour or anywhere else?
A. No, because the issue that arose on the afternoon of that same day, the Thursday where it appeared to her Honour that Mr Salmon deliberately misled her about his address, my recollection is that then I raised that with the Crown the next morning and he indicated that it was his intention, if I raised character, to raise that deliberate lie to the Judge on that afternoon in the course of the proceedings and for that reason I determined that it just became impossible to raise character. "" (T.59.8)

""Q. Well what was there to fear about him being cross-examined on the topic of his residential address?
A. What there was to fear was that her Honour made it clear, as I understood what she was saying to me, that she observed Mr Salmon somehow to affirm that that was a residential address and your Honour will see that there is some - that I went on just below line 20. I said: ""Your Honour saw what your Honour saw from where your Honour sits and your Honour can assess that submission"", that he tells me, my submission that Mr Salmon told me that he was trying to get my attention to indicate that it wasn't this alleged residential address and her Honour, as I understood it, made it very clear that she was of the view that Mr Salmon had indicated his agreement with that being put to the Court as a residential address at the time that I said it from the Bar table.

...

Q. Well, again given what's on 171, I don't quite see why there was any rational risk of him being cross-examined on false residential address? 
A. The - from the environment in the Court room and from me not having eye contact with Mr Salmon at the time that I gave that residential address, I understood her Honour as indicating very clearly that in her view Mr Salmon had, I don't know if acquiesced is the right word but Mr Salmon had somehow indicated his agreement with that being provided to the Court as a residential address. Her Honour, as I perceived it, made it very clear that in her view he had deliberately misled her and I think in my affidavit I extracted those passages where her Honour used those words.

Q. Paragraph 14 I think? 
A. Yes. Her Honour's view was very clear that he had deliberately misled her as opposed to it being confined to a misstatement on my part. If it had been a misstatement on my part, then it wouldn't have had any consequence. "" (T.60.49 - T.61.35)

""Q. Page 173 at line 8 she talked about being most concerned at ""the circumstances that occurred before, immediately before I adjourned"". Not sure what that is leading to?
A. There was a short adjournment and I don't know how long that was on page 172 at line 16 and I think that that is the adjournment her Honour was referring to. So the chronological sequence when you just read page 171 to 172 there is some adjournment there and I don't have any recollection of what the duration of that was, but your Honour is right that it's clear that by page 171 at line 36 I was already in a position where Mr Salmon had brought to my attention that there was some problem about that address that was provided but my concern, in terms of its consequences for raising character I think is encapsulated at page 173 at line 10 where her Honour, you know, says to me ""as you quite correctly pointed out, I was here"". Her Honour had seen something that I hadn't seen because I wasn't looking at Mr Salmon at the time I gave that address."" (T.62.24)

163As already indicated, if her Honour had seen something which indicated that the appellant acquiesced in his counsel providing incorrect information as to his residential address, then the decision by counsel not to call character evidence was certainly understandable. No counsel would wish favourable character evidence to be met with evidence that his client had provided a false address when specifically requested by a trial judge in the course of a trial.

164However, the likelihood of that occurring should also have been considered by counsel. Her Honour was not competent to give evidence - Evidence Act, s 16 - and any questioning by her Honour or anyone else to suggest that her Honour had seen anything misleading would have to have been excluded as unfair. There was, of course, the possibility that counsel would have needed to bear in mind, or eliminate by enquiry, that someone else, perhaps the judge's associate, had seen something but whether during the exigencies of a trial those enquiries could have been made, one does not know. What to do in the circumstances was a decision properly within the authority of counsel and there is no basis for the appellant complaining that character evidence was not called.

165There is, however, another possibility which has already been referred to in relation to the circumstances surrounding the revocation of the appellant's bail, i.e. that her Honour misunderstood what had occurred. In that scenario, the correction by the appellant of the incorrect information appears from the transcript to have been as prompt as was reasonable in the circumstances.

166Since it is not possible at this point in time to determine exactly what did occur, it is necessary to consider whether the failure to call the character witnesses, taken with the incorrect submissions by the Crown concerning the telling of two lies, constituted a miscarriage of justice or that otherwise caused the trial to miscarry.

167In relation to the submission that the appellant was lying in the two respects referred to, counsel for the appellant in his address said:

""The Crown referred you to the cross-examination yesterday as to whether or not he knew that he was director or a secretary or had some relationship with BACM or BACF. Well again that wasn't a lie I'd suggest. He told you that if he was the secretary that was a service that his company provided and he also told you that he was a director of dozens of companies. More importantly you might think it's something that's a very little, if any, significance to the real question in this trial."" (T.316.46) 

""And the Crown said that he couldn't even tell the truth about where he lived, in the record of interview. Well of course he wasn't asked where - he was asked what his address was. Now you might think Mr Salmon is someone who's very careful about answering things precisely in terms that there are. And that's one of the aspects of the way he gives evidence that the Crown says in effect makes him less reliable. Well that's a matter for you to determine, that's not a lie. He was asked his address and he told them an address and it was his mailing address, it's not a lie.

And anyway what bearing does that have on your assessment of his state of mind about whether she was entitled in March 2009 to bank the cheques and whether he had a legal right to go and recover the money that those cheques represented."" (T.317.21)

168Although the appellant did not have the advantage of a direction from the judge that the Crown was not entitled to submit that the appellant told lies about those two matters, it is not without significance that the Crown's submission was fully and appropriately answered by counsel for the appellant in submissions. It was not allowed to stand unchallenged and the challenge made accurately reflected the evidence.

169The affidavit of Mr Charter of 17 November 2011 provides an indication of the sort of character evidence which could have been called on behalf of the appellant. Mr Charter had known the appellant since July 2008 and had worked with him from that date until May 2009. Mr Charter was prepared to say that the appellant was a person of good character and had been employed in a senior role in a public company where his maturity and integrity was never in question. He regarded the appellant as a person of impeccable character. The appellant in his submissions said that he had five other character witnesses. The character evidence given in the sentence proceedings indicates that their evidence would have been similar to that of Mr Charter.

170While character is important in any criminal case, and was particularly so in this case where an important part of the Crown case depended upon the acceptance of the evidence of the complainant, I am not satisfied that the Crown's incorrect submission as to two lies and the non-calling of character witnesses caused a miscarriage of justice or caused this trial to miscarry. The incorrect submissions of the Crown were well balanced by the appellant's counsel in his submissions. The character evidence, while helpful to the appellant, appears to have been of a general kind. This would have been of only limited value in this case, which turned upon specific testimony by the Crown witnesses as to events which they observed or participated in.

171The evidence against the appellant was very strong indeed. In his electronically recorded interview, he conceded the physical activities necessary to establish counts 1 and 3. He also in relation to count 3, and to a lesser extent count 1, provided sufficient evidence to establish the mental element of those offences. In addition, the Crown had eyewitnesses in the complainant, Ms Theodor and Mr Zhao. Their evidence went to count 2, as well as to counts 1 and 3. Finally, the documentary evidence overwhelmingly supported the evidence of the complainant, in particular the cash payments, the personal cheques and the personal undertaking to pay the complainant's fees. 

172I am satisfied upon the whole of the evidence that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of all three counts. Not only that, having made my own independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of these three counts. (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13, 243 CLR 400.)

173Alternatively, even if the two issues which have been found in favour of the appellant were of greater importance than I have assessed, I would dismiss the appeal on the basis that no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. This is because, as already indicated, on my independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the three counts.

174I would dismiss the appellant's appeal against conviction.

Sentence appeal

175Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has served his sentence of imprisonment, he wishes to challenge the sentence which was passed upon him. He is entitled to do so. The factual background and the sentences passed on the applicant have already been set out.

Ground of Appeal 1 - That the learned trial judge erred in failing to have regard to the fact that the said offending contact could be dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum penalty of 12 months would apply.

176The applicant submitted that although evidence was not led as to the value of the computer, stealing from the person is the only offence in Pt 4 Div 1 subdivision 2 of the Crimes Act 1900 that can be dealt with summarily. Where the value of the thing stolen exceeds $5000 it is a Table 1 offence and subject to a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment (s267(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986). Where the value does not exceed $5000 it is a Table 2 offence and is subject to a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment or a fine of 50 penalty units or both.

177The applicant submitted that cases such as R v Trindall [2005] NSWCCA 446 at [37] - [38] and Yassien v R [2006] NSWCCA 15 at [29] - [30] are authority for the proposition that the maximum sentence available in the Local Court may justify ""some mitigation of sentence"" that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. While her Honour was not bound by the jurisdictional maximum that could have been imposed in the Local Court, it was a matter which she should have taken into account in the exercise of her discretion.

178This ground of appeal has not been made out. Section 94 Crimes Act provides for three separate offences - robbery, assault with intent to rob and stealing from the person. Of those three offences, it is only the offence of stealing from the person that might (if the necessary prerequisites are met) be dealt with summarily, pursuant to s265(1) and Schedule 1, Table 1, clause 3b Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The applicant, however, was convicted of robbery not stealing from the person. Accordingly, count 3 could not have been dealt with in the Local Court and her Honour did not err by failing to have regard to that consideration.

Ground of Appeal 2 - That the learned trial judge erred in failing to reflect her finding as to the low objective seriousness of the robbery in the sentence.

Ground of Appeal 3 - That the learned trial judge erred in her application of the principles of totality by partially accumulating the sentences and for effectively ""double punishing"" the offender for the assault charge.

Ground of Appeal 4 - That the learned trial judge erred in that discounts for protective custody were not applied to the sentence.

Ground of Appeal 5 - That material errors, fabrications and misunderstandings of fact influenced the sentencing of the applicant.

Ground of Appeal 6 - That the sentence is manifestly excessive.

179These grounds of appeal can effectively be dealt with together, since they raise similar and overlapping considerations.

180The applicant submitted that her Honour failed to properly consider his offending in context.

(a) The incidents arose out of a business dispute over a relatively small amount of money.

(b) That the computer and attachments were returned to the victim within a few days of being taken.

(c) There was little, if any, premeditation and planning in that as her Honour found, the instances were ""reflective of [the offender's] rage and his loss of control"".

(d) The violence exhibited was minimal with no physical or psychological sequelae.

181The applicant submitted that the objective seriousness of all three offences was low. In relation to the robbery, the finding was that it was at the bottom of the range of seriousness for offences of that type. Although her Honour made no finding about the larceny offence, the applicant submitted that it was also at the bottom of the range. The applicant submitted that it was not clear what her Honour meant by characterising the assault as ""serious"" in that it involved a single instance of pushing. The applicant submitted that it also was at the bottom of the range of seriousness for offences of that type.

182The applicant submitted that since all of the offences were at the bottom of the range, and since they effectively involved a single episode of offending, her Honour should have ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. In failing to do so, she did not observe the principle of totality.

183The applicant submitted that the sentence for the robbery offence was quite out of proportion with the sentences passed in respect of the larceny and assault offences and was in the circumstances manifestly excessive. It failed to have regard to her Honour's own finding that it was at the bottom of the range. It failed to have regard to the circumstances of the offence in that it was inextricably linked with the other two offences which were themselves comparatively minor in objective seriousness.

184The applicant submitted that her Honour did not properly take into account his subjective case and in particular, that he was aged 42, had not previously offended and to the observation and knowledge of the four character witnesses who gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, had never demonstrated any tendency towards violence in the past. The applicant submitted that it was not open to her Honour to find that she was not satisfied that he would not be violent in the future. This was not only contrary to the unchallenged evidence of the character witnesses but was contrary to the assessment of the psychologist who had provided a report to the court.

185I am satisfied that her Honour did not adequately take account of the principle of totality in accumulating the sentences in the way in which she did. The applicable principle is clear. In Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; 205 ALR 346; 78 ALJR 616 at [18] the High Court said:

""In Mill Wilson Deane Dawson Toohey and Gaudron JJ adopted a statement from Thomas ""Principles of Sentencing"" ... at pp 56-7:

""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is ""just and appropriate"". The principle has been stated many times in various forms: ""when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong""; ""when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences"".""


186Similarly in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27]; 168 A Crim R 41 Howie J said:

""27 ... there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""

187The factual matrix of these three offences makes it clear that they were part of a single episode of criminality. The sentence for the robbery offence should have embraced the total criminality of the three counts. The sentences passed by her Honour should have been fully concurrent.

188I am also of the opinion that there is considerable force in the applicant's submission that the sentence for count 3 was manifestly excessive. There seems to be a substantial disconnect between her Honour's assessment of the low level of objective seriousness of the robbery offence and the sentence which was passed. A sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months for an offence which was at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind (her Honour's own finding) appears on its face to be excessive. This is particularly so when regard is had to the objective circumstances of the offence.

189Although her Honour referred in her remarks on sentence to the applicant's subjective case (which was strong), it does not appear to be reflected in the sentence passed. The applicant was a person of mature years, had no previous offences and the character evidence called on his behalf was unanimous that these offences were totally out of character. While I appreciate the discretionary nature of the sentencing process, I am satisfied that her Honour's exercise of the sentencing discretion did miscarry and that the sentence passed for the robbery offence was excessive. I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted. 

190In re-sentencing the applicant, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory ration in s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I do so because this was the applicant's first time in custody.

191Accordingly, in relation to the applicant's application for leave to appeal against sentence, the orders which I propose are:

(1) Leave to appeal is granted.

(2) The appeal is allowed.

(3) The sentences imposed by her Honour on 19 March 2010 are quashed.

(4) In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced as follows:

(a) On the charge of larceny, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 month to commence 14 December 2009 and to conclude 14 January 2010.

(b) On the charge of assault, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months to commence 14 December 2009 and to conclude 13 March 2010.

(c) On the charge of robbery, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months to commence 14 December 2009 and to conclude 13 June 2010.

192RS HULME J: I agree with Hoeben JA

193SCHMIDT J: I agree with Hoeben JA.

2708145,Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 by Anthony Bernard Stevens [2012] NSWSC 425,"DECISION
1HIS HONOUR:  This is an application under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the ""Act"") for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon the applicant, Anthony Bernard Stevens.
Background
2On 15 June 2006, the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment which contained a single count that between about 24 February and about 5 March 2005, at Sydney, in New South Wales he did supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely, cocaine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.
3The Crown alleged the applicant had engaged in two separate acts of supplying cocaine, on 25 February 2005 (the ""first supply"") and 4 March 2005 (the ""second supply"").  They were said by the Crown to amount to a single criminal enterprise.  On each occasion it was alleged that the applicant received, for the purposes of supply, slightly less than a kilogram of cocaine from Robert Pavan.  Thus the Crown contended that the applicant had supplied a total of two kilograms of cocaine.
4Although the applicant pleaded guilty, he disputed that he was involved in the first supply.  The sentencing judge, his Honour Judge Berman SC DCJ, resolved this dispute in favour of the Crown.  Accordingly, the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he had supplied two kilograms of cocaine.
5On 23 June 2006, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment for a period of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 17 May 2005.  The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 16 May 2012.
6The applicant applied to the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave to appeal his sentence.  The first three grounds of appeal relied upon related to his Honour's finding that the applicant was involved in the first supply.  The fourth ground of appeal was that a different, less severe, sentence was warranted and ought to have been imposed.  On 28 August 2007, the Court ordered that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed:  Stevens v R [2007] NSWCCA 252.
7On 24 April 2009 Robert Pavan was also sentenced by his Honour Judge Berman SC DCJ.  Mr Pavan was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 and a half years to commence from 9 May 2005.  Mr Pavan was sentenced after pleading guilty to the charge that he supplied a large commercial quantity of cocaine.  The particulars of that charge were that he had supplied a kilogram of cocaine to the applicant on two separate occasions, and had also supplied a kilogram of cocaine on a third occasion to two other men, Ian Hinch and David Dowe;  see R v Pavan [2009] NSWDC 82.
The Application
8The sole basis for the application for an inquiry is an asserted lack of parity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and that imposed upon Mr Pavan (see Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295).
9There was no opportunity for the applicant to raise this as a ground of appeal before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  At the time of that appeal Mr Pavan had not been sentenced.  The applicant concedes and the Crown does not dispute that the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal have now been perfected either by their entry onto the Court's computerised record system or the preparation of a notification of the Court's determination (see rr 50B and 51 of the Criminal Appeal Rules).  As those orders provided for leave to appeal to be granted but the appeal dismissed, it follows that the perfection of the orders means that it does not have jurisdiction to re-open the appeal (Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; (1938) 60 CLR 431;  Postligione at 300).
10Two issues arise on this application.  First, the Crown has raised an issue of construction as to whether the applicant's complaint of a lack of parity raises a ""doubt or a question"" as to a ""mitigating circumstance"" within the meaning of s  79(2) of the Act.  Second, if that question is resolved in the affirmative does the material pointed to by the applicant cause me a ""feeling of unease or a sense of disquiet"" in allowing, in this case, the sentence to stand (Varley v the Attorney General of NSW (1987) 8 NSWLR 30).
""A doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance?""
11Sections 78 and 79 of the Act provide:78   Applications to Supreme Court
(1)  An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.
(2)  The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.
79   Consideration of applications
(1)  After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:
(a)  the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or
(b)  the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(2)  Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
(3)  The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:
(a)  it appears that the matter:
(i)  has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or
(ii)  has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or
(iii)  has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or
(iv)  has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and
(b)  the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.
(3A)  The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:
(a)  the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or
(b)  the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or
(c)  the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.
(4)  Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.
(5)  The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).
12The Crown's submissions queried whether the application of the principle of parity is a ""mitigating circumstance"" within the meaning of subsection 79(2).  They suggest that it is not, as parity is ""a principle that is applied as between offenders, after the relevant objective and subjective features of each [of] the offenders and other relevant factual and evidentiary matters have been determined"".  The Crown submits that ""[o]nly then is the question of parity considered"".
13The applicant contended that this argument involved an unduly restrictive interpretation of ""mitigating circumstance"".  He contends that it was the intention of the legislature to give the Supreme Court broad powers to conduct reviews of convictions and sentences.  He also contends that, properly understood, the principle of parity is only capable of mitigating a sentence and not increasing it (citing R v Radloff (1996) 88 A Crim R 26 at 31 - 32 per Cox CJ).
14In Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; (2003) 214 CLR 318 at [60] Heydon J confirmed that former s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 formed part of a scheme of remedial legislation and should be given a beneficial construction although then it is not an excuse to ""construe a statute so as to achieve a result which they think the legislature should have enacted"" (citing Varley at 34, per Hope JA).  Section 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 was the predecessor to ss 78 and 79 and for present purposes was not relevantly different.
15In Eastman at [18] McHugh J stated, inter alia:
""Together with the 'mitigating circumstances' limb, it suggests that s 475 as a whole was concerned with what happened at the trial and with new evidence that suggests that the prisoner should not have been convicted or that his or her culpability is less than might appear from the conviction.""
16Both the applicant and the Crown's argument appears to have proceeded upon the premise that the ""mitigating circumstance"" was the application of the parity principle. If that is the correct characterisation of their submissions then I do not agree.  In my view the (potentially) mitigating circumstances was the sentence imposed on Mr Pavan which occurred after the applicant's sentence and appeal. Whether it was truly a mitigating circumstance depends upon the application of the parity principle to that circumstance (and to other circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence).  A ""doubt"" or ""question"" as to the guilt of a person can clearly arise from evidence that emerges or events that occur after their conviction. Similarly, a ""question"" as to a mitigating circumstance can arise from evidence that emerges, or events that occur, after the sentence.  I see no reason why a question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance cannot arise even if the circumstance was not known at the time the sentence was imposed.
17The point raised by the Crown might arise if all that was contended for was that a different legal framework should have been applied in assessing the weight to be attached to the circumstances known at the time of sentence or any appeal from the sentence.  Even then it might be arguable that there is still ""a question"" as to any ""mitigating circumstance"".  However, it is not necessary for me to consider this further.
Parity
18It follows from the above that I must then consider whether the sentence imposed on Mr Pavan raise a ""doubt or question"" as to a ""mitigating circumstance"" in this case.  For it to reach that threshold in this case it must at least raise the question whether it is in fact a mitigating circumstance (see Eastman at [134]).  I interpret the threshold of whether it ""rais[es]"" such a question in a manner consistent with Varley, namely, whether it leads me to consider that the sentence imposed on Mr Pavan is such that I have a ""feeling of unease or sense of disquiet"" about the sentence imposed on the applicant.  This in turn raises the application of principles of parity.
19The circumstances of the applicant's offence were recorded in the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment as follows (at [21] to [26]):
""21. On the evening of 25 February 2005, 'Tom' went to 'P's' house in Maroubra.  He had with him a kilogram of cocaine which had been provided to him by police under an authority granted under the Law Reform (Controlled Operations) Act 1997.
22. 'Tom' and 'P' drove to Torrington Road, Maroubra.  The car stopped 50 metres in front of a Toyota Landcruiser which had Victorian number plates which were registered to the applicant.
23. 'Tom' gave the cocaine to 'P' who left the vehicle and walked towards the Landcruiser.  However, Tom did not see what happened next, because it was dark.  'P' returned with a black bag.  The bag contained $165,000 in cash and a note which read 'I want one the same again.  If I do not ring you midday tomorrow I will be in the same spot Friday week at the same time'.  The note, as I have earlier observed, was objected to as being inadmissible.
24. Police subsequently followed the Landcruiser from a point in Maroubra to Albion Park, near Wollongong.
25. On Friday 4 March 2005, 'Tom' again went to 'P's' house with a kilogram of cocaine, again supplied by police pursuant to a controlled operation.  'P' was given the cocaine and left the car and came back with a bag containing money.
26. The applicant's car was observed by police in the vicinity of Malabar Road and it was followed to Victoria.  Victorian Police stopped the vehicle and the cocaine identified as that the police had given 'Tom' was located in the vehicle.""
20The sentencing judge found that the applicant was a courier but not a ""mere courier"".  The applicant was found to have a level of involvement in the ""drug selling operation which allowed initiative and decision making"".  His Honour found the applicant performed ""a significant and essential role"" in the supply of substantial quantities of drugs.
21At the time of sentence the applicant was 53 years of age with no prior convictions.  His Honour found that this was a ""significant matter"" but this ""was qualified because there is no doubt that the offender has been involved in drug taking for a lengthy period of time"".  His Honour described the applicant as having ""an extremely long term history of drug abuse"".  This long-term addiction and his reported lack of insight led his Honour to find that he could not ""make a positive finding in the [applicant's] favour that he is unlikely to re-offend"".  However, his Honour found that he would benefit from an extended period of supervision and made a finding of special circumstances.
22His Honour found the applicant was remorseful and was afforded a discount of 20% to reflect his plea of guilty albeit at a level of culpability that was ultimately not accepted.  As I have stated the applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.  
23Mr Pavan was also dealt with by his Honour Judge Berman SC DCJ.  His Honour recorded the circumstances of Mr Pavan's offences as follows (R v Pavan at [5] to [8]):
""5. The offender became involved in these transactions after meeting a man by the name of Hatfield.  He was one of the Mr Bigs I referred to earlier.  Hatfield together with two others, Leslie Mara and Michael Hurley, were involved in large-scale cocaine importation and distribution.  Having a large quantity of cocaine in their possession, they needed to sell it for profit.  Part of that process required the identification of prospective purchasers and the handing over of the cocaine and the receipt of money.
6. The offender said that he owed on Hatfield's behalf a significant sum of money, and that Hatfield suggested that one way that the money could be recouped was if the offender became involved in the first of the transactions.  That was the supply of a kilogram of cocaine to two men, Hinch and Dowe, on 23 February 2005.
7. It was the offender who caused Mr Dowe to be recruited to the chain of drug supply.  To put matters more clearly, it was the offender who identified Dowe as a prospective purchaser and then made arrangements for the handing over of the cocaine and the receipt of the money.   The offender was present when the actual transaction took place, supervising it and making sure that all went to plan.  How the offender was able to identify someone who wanted to buy a kilogram of cocaine was not made clear.
8. The other two transactions were broadly similar in that the offender identified a Mr Stephens as someone who was involved or interested in obtaining two kilograms of cocaine.  On two separate occasions the offender arranged the supply of about a kilogram of cocaine to Mr Stephens for the payment of significant sums of money.  These transactions would likely not have taken place were it not for the offender's involvement.  He had a very significant role in what occurred.""
24His Honour found that Mr Pavan had a significant role in the drug supply transactions.  In relation to the two drug supplies to the applicant, his Honour found that he had a very significant role.  Rather than classify Mr Pavan as a ""principal"" or ""courier"", his Honour sentenced Mr Pavan on the basis that he had obtained the purchasers, arranged the transactions and supervised them.
25At the time of sentence Mr Pavan was 60 years of age.  Although he had a criminal history, his Honour found that Mr Pavan was ""in many respects a man of good character"".  His Honour found that he had managed to reach the age of 56 with only minor matters on his criminal history, which was ""testament to his underlying character"" (Pavan at [3] to [4]).
26Notwithstanding that his Honour accepted that Mr Pavan was a user of cocaine at the time, his Honour found he had involved himself in drug transactions for financial gain, even if that financial advantage was relatively small (Pavan at [11]).
27His Honour also found Mr Pavan expressed remorse and contrition.  Mr Pavan received a 20 percent discount for the plea of guilty (Pavan at [14]).  His Honour also made a finding of special circumstances (Pavan at [20]).  As I have stated his Honour sentenced Mr Pavan to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years.
28Two further matters should be noted about Mr Pavan's sentence.  First, his Honour specifically found that Mr Pavan had ""good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend due in no small measure to the substantial support he will receive on release from custody"" (Pavan at [4]).
29Second, his Honour specifically referred to the sentences imposed on others involved in the drug supplies including the applicant and stated (Pavan at [18]):
""The principles of parity do apply such that I should ensure that the offender is not left with a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon the others.  As I said, there are many differences between their cases and this, the most important of which is that the offender was involved in three separate transactions, more than Finch, Dow or Stephens.  It is significantly more serious for the offender to have involved himself in the further supply of one kilogram when comparing the sentence imposed upon him to the sentence I earlier imposed upon Stephens.  The supply of a kilogram of a dangerous drug such as cocaine is not something lightly set aside and ignored.""
30It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the discussion on parity in Postiglione (noting that the principle was considered in the context of Crown appeals in Green v The Queen;  Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 495 (2011) 86 ALJR 36).  In Postiglione at 301 in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ it was said:
""The parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to 'a justifiable sense of grievance'.""
31In Postiglione at 309 McHugh J said:
""If a judge wrongly fails to give effect to the parity principle, an appellate court will intervene to correct what is an error in sentencing principle.  In Lowe v The Queen, Gibbs CJ, with whom Wilson J agreed, said that an appellate court should intervene where 'the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done'.  Mason J stated that an appellate court is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance.  Dawson J, with whom Wilson J also agreed, was of the view that '[t]he difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice'.""
32And in Postiglione at 323 Gummow J said:
""The principle for which Lowe is authority appears to be that the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes where the difference between the two sentences is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done.
In R v Taudevin (1996) 2 VR 402 at 404, Callaway JA said, in a passage with which I agree:
""The important words are 'manifestly', 'justifiable' and 'objective'.  There is much to be said for the view that all three requirements are variations on the same theme, ie that only a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive will satisfy the other two requirements.""
33In Postiglione at 335 Kirby J said: 
""The removal of serious and unjustifiable disparities in the treatment of like cases is a legitimate goal of the administration of criminal justice.""
34A mere disparity is insufficient.  It must be a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive (see Newman v R [2012] NSWCCA 69 at [22] per Black J).
35My consideration of this application is an exercise of administrative, not judicial power (Varley at 48-50). I am not exercising the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Instead I am only considering whether a question is raised as to a mitigating circumstance.  My task is to determine whether there is a ""sense of disquiet"" over the sentence. It is not my function to resolve any such disquiet.  Nevertheless, I do not consider that the parity argument is sufficiently strong to enable me to conclude that any such question is raised.  The sentencing judge was completely cognisant of the need to apply the parity principle.  The subjective case of Mr Pavan was significantly stronger than that of the applicant, especially the finding concerning his likelihood of re-offending.  The quantity of drugs supplied and the increased role of Mr Pavan was certainly a differentiating factor that warranted a longer sentence.  The extra term of 1 year on the overall sentence and six months on the non-prole period reflected that in the context of Mr Pavan's superior subjective case. The sentence imposed on Pavan does not raise a question as to whether there is a manifest discrepancy between that sentence and the sentence imposed on the applicant.
36The sentence imposed on Mr Pavan does not give rise to a sense of disquiet in the sentence imposed on the applicant.  I do not consider that there is a doubt or a question as to any mitigating circumstance concerning the applicant.
37The application is refused.

2708161,R v STANYARD [2012] NSWDC 78,"Judgment

Introduction

1A terrible thing happened on 7th of February 2009. The accused, Christopher Stanyard, was driving a small Suzuki four wheel drive in an area of some sand dunes. As he drove over one of the dunes the vehicle rolled forward on to its roof. Seated in the back were two young girls, Nicole Crawford and Kristen Free. Both of them were injured when the vehicle rolled over. Ms Free broke both her arms but Ms Crawford suffered a much more serious injury with the result that she is now a tetraplegic with no feelings or movement from her shoulders down. 

2The accused was charged with dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. There are two such counts, one relating to Ms Free and one relating to Ms Crawford. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked that he be tried by judge alone. 

3In the circumstances of this trial, the ultimate issue for me to decide was whether the accused was driving the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person or persons immediately before it overturned. There is no issue that the accused was driving the motor vehicle, nor that it was involved in an impact, nor that, as a result of that impact, grievous bodily harm was occasioned to Ms Crawford and Ms Free. 

Relevant Principles of Law

4Before I discuss the evidence called in the trial, and the conclusions which I draw from it, I will set out some preliminary matters. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury were this a trial where the jury decided the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

5I will determine all the relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case was made up of what witnesses said in Court and the evidence which has been tendered. I have made no enquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. I have never been to the location where the collision occurred.

6I have decided this case coldly and unemotionally. Were there a jury I would instruct them to ignore any feelings of sympathy or any other emotion that they might feel in deciding whether or not the accused is guilty of the two charges he faces. Judges are not immune to feelings of sympathy. It is impossible not to feel sorry for the awful thing that has occurred to Ms Crawford. In the witness box she presented as a proud, determined young woman, but it was impossible not to be moved by the situation she now finds herself in. I have recognised those feelings, recognised their effect upon me and then put those feelings to one side. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free from prejudice and sympathy. 

7It is undeniable that a terrible thing happened on 7 February 2009 and there may be something of an automatic reaction to think that ""someone must pay"". Such thoughts have also been put aside. 

Onus of Proof

8The most important and fundamental principle of law which I apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. The accused starts from the position that he is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty.

9What the Crown must prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt, are the ingredients or essentials facts contained in the charges arising form the indictment. 

Not All Issues of Fact Need to be Resolved

10It is important to understand that what the Crown must prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt are the elements of these offences. The Crown does not need to prove that every word spoken by everyone of its witnesses is true. Indeed some of the witnesses called by the Crown gave contradictory evidence, in particular Mr Sayers, who had been a passenger in the vehicle that day, said things which contradicted what many other Crown witnesses said. 

11It is not necessary to find in favour of the Crown on every issue of fact which is disputed by the accused. Nor is it necessary to come to a finding one way or the other about many of the disputed aspects of the evidence. Thus, for example, I simply do not need to make a finding about such things as whether the accused was told the rules of the park verbally when he paid the entrance fee. Similarly I have not found it necessary to resolve the issue as to whether Mr Sayers said to Mr Tyler ""he's going to try and jump that sand dune over there"". There are many other matters I have not found it necessary to resolve.

Silence of the Accused in Court

12The accused did not give evidence. I have not used that in any way against him. The accused was entitled to say nothing in Court and make the Crown prove his guilt if it could. The fact that the accused did not give evidence does not effect the fundamental proposition which I must apply - that is that the Crown must prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

13So the silence of the accused in Court is not evidence against him. His election not to give evidence was not an admission made by him. His decision not to give evidence must not be used by me to fill gaps in the Crown case or make up any deficiencies or defects in the Crown's case that might exist.

The Elements Which Are Not in Dispute

14As I mentioned before, some of the elements which the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt are not in dispute. 

15I will deal with them before returning to those matters which are in dispute. Before I can find the accused guilty on the charges that he faces I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the following four elements. 

The accused was the driver of the Suzuki Sierra registered number AW48KK.
That vehicle was involved in an impact.
As a result of that impact the particular person named in each of the two charges suffered grievous bodily harm.
At the time of the impact the vehicle was being driven in a manner which was dangerous to other persons.

16The evidence clearly establishes the first three elements in each count. Ms Crawford and Ms Free gave evidence that the accused was the driver of the vehicle when it rolled over and impacted with the sand underneath. They gave evidence of the harm that they had thereby suffered. That harm amounted to really serious bodily injury. Other people saw what happen as well. The location where the collision occurred was used for recreational four wheel driving and others involved in that activity that afternoon saw what happened and assisted the young girls afterwards. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the first three elements has been made out. 

The Element Which is in Dispute - The Manner in Which the Accused was Driving

17That leaves for determination the real issue in this trial which concerns whether the vehicle was being driven in a manner dangerous to other persons at the time of the impact. 

18Let me, at this stage, give a bit more detail about what is common ground occurred that afternoon before dealing with the matter in more depth. The accused, Ms Crawford and Ms Free, together with a friend of the accused named Todd Sayers, went to Boat Harbour Park near the airport south of Sydney. The area is a private park where there were sand dunes. The four young people went to the beach and later got back into the accused's vehicle. 

19It is important to understand what later happened to know that Mr Stanyard's vehicle had a soft top rather than a hard, fixed roof. There was thus limited protection to the passengers should a vehicle of this kind roll over when compared with a vehicle with a fixed, hard roof. 

20When the four of them got back in the vehicle the accused was driving, his friend Mr Sayers was in the front passenger seat and the two young girls were seated in the rear passenger seats. Although the soft top had been down earlier in the day, the soft top was put up after they left the beach.

21Mr Stanyard drove his vehicle in the area of the sand dunes. There is one particular sand dune which, like all sand dunes I gather, has a flatter side and a steeper side. The accused, with his three passengers in the vehicle, drove over that sand dune, driving up the flatter side, going over the crest, and then driving down the steeper side. He decided to repeat the manoeuvre.

22Mr Sayers got out of the vehicle with Ms Free's camera intending to take a photo of the vehicle as it went over the dune. (As it turns out investigations revealed that he didn't take any relevant photo). He stood at the bottom of the steep face of the sand dune. The accused, with the two girls still in his vehicle, drove the vehicle towards the crest of the dune driving up the less steep side of the sand dune intending to again go over the apex of the dune and down the other, steeper, side. 

23There are a number of areas about what then occurred which are in dispute. But what is not in dispute is that as the vehicle was going down, it flipped forwards, rolling onto its roof, causing both of the young girls in the back to suffer grievous bodily harm of the kind I mentioned earlier. 

24There is a dispute as to why it was that the vehicle rolled forwards. It is the Crown case that the accused was driving at an excessive speed, causing the vehicle to become airborne as it went over the apex of the dune, thus in turn causing it to land on its nose on the steep side of the dune and then flip over onto its roof.

25The defence case is that the accused was not travelling at a dangerous speed and that the vehicle rolled forward without becoming airborne.

26Of course I should emphasise that it is not a matter where the accused has to prove that the version of events that he advances is true. At all times I must ask myself whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and in the circumstances of this case that involves a question as to whether the Crown has satisfied me to that high standard that the accused was driving dangerously at the time of the impact. 

27The Crown puts its case on three bases. It says that 

the accused was driving at excessive speed. 
the accused's decision to drive the vehicle off such a steep sand dune was dangerous in itself, no matter what speed the vehicle was travelling and 
it was dangerous to drive this particular vehicle in that manner where it was not equipped with a protective roof or roll bar. 

28Should I be satisfied that the accused was driving in a manner dangerous to other people because of the excessive speed at which he was travelling then I do not really need to examine terribly closely (or indeed at all) whether he would also be said to be driving dangerously in the other circumstances referred to by the Crown. 

29The Crown relied on three important circumstances in considering the dangerousness of the speed at which the vehicle was travelling.  They were the height from the top of the dune to the bottom, the angle of the steep face of the dune and the fact that the surface was sand, loose in parts. 

The Speed the Vehicle Was Travelling on the Sand Dune

30Evidence as to the speed the vehicle was travelling came from very many sources. There is direct evidence as well as other evidence from which inferences can be drawn. As an example of the latter the Crown relies on evidence to suggest that the vehicle became airborne as it went over the crest of the dune. 

31Expert evidence was called too. The witnesses gave their evidence concurrently after helpfully providing a joint document, which set out where one expert's opinion had changed, where they had reached agreement, and where they continued to disagree. Although Mr Alan Joy was called by the accused and Dr Raphael Grzebieta was called by the Crown, I detected no bias in either witness, and considered that they were both complying with their obligations to assist the Court.

32The experts differ by a very small amount as regards their calculations of the speed the vehicle was travelling as it went over the crest.

33Mr Joy calculated the speed at which the vehicle was travelling as it passed over the brink of the sand dune as being about 22.6 kilometres per hour. Dr Grzebieta agreed with the formula that Mr Joy used, but disagreed with some of the figures used in the formula. Dr Grzebieta considered that Mr Joy had overestimated the height that the vehicle had fallen and underestimated the horizontal distance it travelled. Using Dr Grzebieta's figures the estimated launch speed is 25 kilometres per hour. The difference in figures is explained by the experts taking their measurements from different sources. Mr Joy scaled the relevant measurements from a plan prepared by the police. Dr Grzebiata used measurements taken by a police officer at the scene. Neither method of measuring seemed to be inherently better or worse than the other. 

34Mr Daily for the accused accepts that the speed of the vehicle was at least the speed calculated by Mr Joy. I am therefore prepared to proceed on the basis that the speed of the accused's vehicle as it went over the crest of the sand dune was at least 22.6 kilometres per hour.

35The other area of disagreement between the two experts concerns the certainty with which they considered that the accused's vehicle was airborne, such that all four tyres had left the sand, as it travelled in a downwards direction. Dr Grzebieta considered that it was ""highly likely"" that that occurred. Mr Joy said that he could not exclude the reasonable possibility that the vehicle was airborne and it was ""line ball"" on a balance of probabilities test.

36 What is perhaps more important than the question of whether the speed was 22.6 kilometres per hour or 25 kilometres an hour is this area of disagreement, namely whether the vehicle did in fact become airborne after it went over the crest. The evidence from sources other than the experts makes it clear beyond reasonable doubt that the vehicle was airborne. Eye witnesses said the vehicle became airborne and there is an absence of tyre tracks heading down the steep face of the dune suggesting that the tyres were not in contact with the steep face of the sand dune as the vehicle took its path from the crest of the hill to where it ended up at the bottom of the sand dune, on its roof. 

37Let me at this stage explain the physical mechanism by which causing a vehicle to become airborne leads to it rotating forwards with the result that, in this case, the vehicle completely flipped over after its nose contacted the sand. As a vehicle drives up an incline its tyres would ordinarily be in contact with the surface underneath. As the vehicle reaches the top of that incline, the vehicle will tend to travel in the same direction with the front tyres of the vehicle leaving the surface if the momentum of the vehicle is sufficient. Once that happens the front of the vehicle commences to fall under the influence of gravity. But as the rear tyres remain in contact with the surface the rear of the vehicle does not fall. There is thus rotational force imparted to the vehicle. It will rotate in a forwards direction around its centre of gravity. Once the rear wheels also leave the surface and the vehicle is completely airborne, the vehicle continues to rotate. There is nothing to stop the vehicle rotating until it comes into contact with something to stop it.

38To summarise - driving a vehicle in such a way as to cause it to become airborne also causes that vehicle to rotate in a forwards direction as it falls.

39But of course there are other obvious consequences of driving a vehicle such that its tyres lose contact with the surface apart from rotation. You can't slow down a vehicle using the brakes when the tyres are not in contact with the ground underneath. The driver can do nothing to arrest the descent of a vehicle which is falling through the air. The driver can't change the path of the vehicle by steering. Once the vehicle is airborne the driver has no control over it in any way.

40As I alluded to earlier, the Crown relies on more than one aspect of the evidence in order to establish that the vehicle did become airborne. It relies on expert evidence. It relies on what witnesses did see (the vehicle being airborne) and what witnesses did not see (tyre tracks in the steep face of the dune). The Crown called evidence from witnesses who say they actually saw the vehicle become airborne after it reached the apex of the dune. It called evidence from witnesses who did not see tyre tracks in the steep side of the dune which should have been there, says the Crown, if the vehicle's tyres remained in contact with the sand before it flipped over. 

41In contrast to the Crown case that the vehicle became airborne because the accused drove it at a dangerous speed, on 24 February 2009 the accused told police that he was driving very slowly indeed saying: ""I think going, as I went over, I went so slow... ""

42In answers following Q 241 in his ERISP the accused told police that as he was going up the approach side of the dune he was travelling about ""walking pace"", maybe a bit faster but that as he approached the top of the sand dune he slowed down ""pretty much to a stop"". Indeed the accused appears at Q193 to have attributed the collision to his travelling too slowly. This suggestion was not pursued at trial

43As it became clear during the course of the trial the defence case as advanced in questions put to witnesses involved a scenario, said to be consistent with the innocence of the accused, whereby the front wheels of the Suzuki broke through the surface of the sand at the very peak of the sand dune causing the front wheels to drop, imparting rotational movement to the vehicle. Under this scenario the front of the car was said to have dug in to the steep face of the sand dune towards its very top, this causing the vehicle to overturn. 

44A number of things need to be noted about this alternative scenario postulated by defence counsel. Firstly it was not put, at least in clear terms, to either expert so that the expert could give his opinion as to whether such a scenario was a reasonably possible version of what had occurred. Secondly under this alternative hypothesis the vehicle did not become airborne, with the rear wheels at least being in constant contact with the sand until the vehicle overturned, and the front wheels being only off the sand momentarily. Thirdly I was asked to take into account an ""unknown factor"" or ""environmental factors"" which would have caused the front of the vehicle to dig into the sand towards the top of the steep face of the dune.

45I mentioned before the accused's interview with police. As I have explained in his ERISP he suggested that he travelled over the top of the sand dune, immediately before the vehicle turned onto its roof, at a very slow speed, indeed saying that he slowed right down ""pretty much to a stop"". It is clear however, that when I compare the evidence of those witnesses who saw the accused driving in the park that day and the evidence of the experts that the speed was at least 22.6 kilometres per hour, with what the accused told police about his manner of driving, the accused was misrepresenting what had occurred.

46Of course what an accused says to police in an ERISP is important evidence that a judge should take into account. But where it's been shown, without a shadow of a doubt, that the accused has told police things which are simply not capable of belief, the weight which must be given to the accused's version, must necessarily be significantly reduced.


The Evidence of Eye Witnesses Who Saw the Vehicle Rolling Over.

47I will now deal with the evidence from lay witnesses regarding the issue as to whether the vehicle became airborne.

48As I explained, the impact occurred in an area where recreational four wheel driving over sand dunes took place. There were many others, apart from the accused and those in his vehicle, who were present in the sand dunes that afternoon. Most importantly, evidence was called from three people who were actually at the base of the sand dune over which the accused's vehicle travelled and who witnessed what happened

49Of course, words do not convey events as well as a video or even still photographs of those events. But even within that limitation, these three witnesses, completely independent of anyone involved in the trial, gave graphic evidence of what they saw. 

Adrian Katsis

50Adrian Katsis was the passenger in a four wheel drive vehicle driven by Matthew Tyler. Natasha Phillips was also in the vehicle. After driving around for a bit the vehicle stopped at the bottom of the relevant sand dune. Mr Katsis, Mr Tyler, and Ms Phillips got out of the vehicle. 

51Mr Katsis was watching the accused's vehicle and in particular he watched as that vehicle negotiated the sand dune successfully. After seeing that he noticed that the front seat passenger from the vehicle, Todd Sayers, came down from the dune towards him. It was clear, because of what he said and because of what he was carrying, that he was going to take a video or photograph of the vehicle as it went over the crest of the sand dune. Mr Katsis described what he saw from a point about three metres away from where the Suzuki ultimately came to rest.

52Mr Katsis gave this evidence:

Q. What did you see that blue Suzuki doing when you say it came down?
A. When it came down all I can remember was all four-wheels were in the air, it was airborne and it just came on a vertical angle with the front - you know with the headlights and the grille and slid a little bit like that and it just flipped over like.

...

Q. When you first saw the wheels off the ground was the front part of the vehicle in contact with the sand or not?
A. No, when it came off the dune the tyres were up in the air and then it's just gone head first and it's just slid a bit.

...

Q. Could you see the underside of the vehicle, the bottom of the vehicle at any time?
A. Underneath it?

Q. Yes?
A. For a short second yeah.

Q. When?
A. When the whole vehicle came off the dune - this is all split second stuff. It's like a Hollywood movie.

53In cross-examination it was put to him that the vehicle ""immediately dipped down without getting airborne"". He denied that that is what occurred saying:

A. No that's - the tyres were in the air, it was - it didn't go down the hill, like it's all tyres and it was just rolling down the hill. This was high revving, you could hear it, you could hear something coming and then a Hollywood movie four-wheels are in the air.

At most he was prepared to admit that he may not have seen the tyre furthest away from him:

Q. What I'm going to suggest to you is as that vehicle's come over that sand dune and those front wheels of the vehicle have, as I said, dipped immediately down and contacted with that upper face of that sand dune and then it slid down that slope?
A. No it's come off, I saw the tyres and then it's just - like I said it nosedived, it slid for a short moment and then it just flipped.

Q. When you say ""saw the tyres"" you're talking all four tyres are you?
A. Okay, I'll be more specific then. I'll say that I saw three tyres because I can't see the other back tyre of the side.

Q. So what you would say is that vehicle, without seeing the furthest tyre because it's looking away from you, and you say that that vehicle was completely airborne as it came over that crest?
A. Completely airborne.

54He was adamant in the accuracy of his observations:

I saw all the - those three tyres and it will always be in my head that it was airborne no matter what anybody says, that's what I saw and that's what I'm - that I said on my statement and that's what I'm saying now. That there was tyres airborne.


55To say that Mr Katsis' evidence is powerfully indicative of dangerous driving is something of an understatement. In complete contrast to the version of events given by the accused when he spoke to police, Mr Katsis has the vehicle becoming airborne over the crest of the sand dune after hearing ""high revving"".

56There is no reason to think that Mr Katsis might have made a mistake in his evidence. It is apparently entirely consistent with what he told police when they interviewed him, he was in an ideal spot to observe what he saw, and his attention was drawn to the vehicle before it appeared over the top of the sand dune. It is not contradicted by any of the expert evidence. But perhaps of most importance, what he observed is strongly supported by other evidence, in particular the evidence of Mr Tyler and Ms Phillips, the evidence of whom I will deal with next. And on top of that there is the evidence concerning the absence of tyre marks down the steep face of the sand dune leading to where the accused's vehicle overturned (suggesting the accuracy of Mr Katsis' evidence that the vehicle was airborne, with the wheels not in contact with the sand after it came over the crest). 

Natasha Phillips

57Ms Phillips was also standing at the base of the relevant sand dune. She gave this evidence:

Q. Would you describe in greater detail what it is that you saw when you say that the vehicle came over the hill?
A. Well it was quite a steep hill and it came over and I know it was in the air because you could see the blue underneath it from the sky, and it literally landed like that on its nose and it sort of slided a little bit and then landed on its roof. It looked like the momentum pushed it onto its roof.

In cross -examination she said something similar:

Q. So what exactly did you see then, tell us exactly what you saw?
A. I saw the vehicle come over the hill. I saw that it had become airborne because you could quite visibly see the sky underneath the bottom of it, and then it landed on the sand dune and flipped onto its roof.


She denied that the wheels were still in contact with the sand as the vehicle came over the crest:

Q. What I'm suggesting is that clearance, meaning that the wheels are still in tact with the sand and you're able to see that gap between the sand and the bottom of the vehicle whilst it's still in contact with the sand?
A. That is incorrect.


She confirmed that ""it landed nose first. It did not land tyres first"" although ""when the nose hit the sand"" the front tyres were ""in contact with the sand"". 

58Although there was some confusion in some aspects of what she said there was no doubt that it was her evidence that the vehicle was airborne. She said ""I did see blue sky underneath the vehicle which would suggest that it's airborne."" 

Q. Did you ever see a gap between the sand and any of the wheels of the Suzuki?
A. Yes, I'm sorry, yes, that's what I'm trying to say, sorry.

This was later clarified in re-examination. Ms Phillips said that there was a large gap between the front wheels and the sand but she was not entirely sure about the back wheels because of the angle the vehicle was on. 

59Once more Ms Phillips was an independent witness, in a good position to observe what she saw. She was adamant that there was a large gap between the front wheels and the sand. She did not know, her evidence ultimately was, about the back wheels. This of course is not positive evidence that the back wheels were in contact with the sand, merely evidence that Ms Phillips could not say one way or the other. It does not contradict the evidence of Mr Katsis and the absence of tyre marks in the steep face of the dune suggests that, had Ms Phillips been in a position to see, she would have seen that the back wheels also were off the ground.

Matthew Tyler

60The other person who was with Mr Katsis and Ms Phillips that day was Matthew Tyler. He was the owner of the four wheel drive in which the three of them travelled around the sand dunes that day. His attention was drawn to the Suzuki driven by the accused because of the manner it was being driven. He noticed it because he said:

It was driving fairly erratically, quite fast, you know, clearly above the speed limit that it should have been doing. Excessively trying to get airborne over sand dunes, et cetera. 


He watched the Suzuki for about 15 minutes. He then stopped his vehicle and got out of it. He saw Mr Sayers and spoke to him after Mr Sayers got out of the Suzuki. This is what he described hearing and seeing after that:

I remember standing with Adrian at the top, up towards my vehicle, and seeing - well to start with I heard it. You could hear the engine of the Suzuki straining up the dune and then I remember seeing the front wheels and the bonnet become visible at the top. I remember seeing the front wheels get airborne over the top of the sand dune. I wasn't really watching what the other guy was doing but I know that he did have a digital camera out at that point. And then I remember seeing probably the vehicle airborne halfway down its chassis until the back wheels started to leave the ground and then as soon as the back wheels came off the ground I just remember it rolling over in the middle of - in the air and remember hearing the crunch of the windscreen and the shattering of the glass and people screaming.

In cross-examination he said that the part of the Suzuki which hit the sand first was the front of the vehicle, not the front tyres. In contrast with the evidence of Mr Katsis he said that he could not say that the vehicle was not completely airborne but was adamant that the front wheels were off the ground.

61I should mention that in his evidence Mr Joy, the defence expert, referred to some evidence of Mr Tyler which suggested that the vehicle was not airborne. However I am satisfied that in the passage that Mr Joy referred to, Mr Tyler was referring to observations he had made of the vehicle at earlier times, not its path immediately before it overturned. 

62Once more Mr Tyler was independent, in a good position to observe and hear what happened, and his attention had been drawn to the vehicle before it came over the crest. What he saw was the Suzuki driving over the crest in such a manner that the front wheels left the ground, the front of the vehicle fell under the influence of gravity until the front of the vehicle, and perhaps the front tyres, contacted the sand further down the steep face of the sand dune.

Phillip Hillyer

63For the sake of completeness I should mention the evidence of another witness, Phillip Hillyer, who at one stage said that he saw the Suzuki being driven in such a manner that its front wheels were off the sand, on one of the occasions that he saw it being driven over a sand dune. Mr Hillyer's evidence changed repeatedly after he was reminded about what he had earlier told police. His evidence in court as to whether he had ever seen the front wheels leave the sand went backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards until I rather got the impression that Mr Hillyer had given up attempting to assist by answering questions with his genuine recollection and instead was saying whatever he thought would make it easier for him. I place no weight on his evidence concerning the question of whether the Suzuki's front wheels ever left the ground.

Summary of the Evidence of Eye Witnesses

64As I began my summary of the evidence of the independent witnesses who were at the base of the relevant sand dune and who heard and saw what happened, their evidence painted a picture of a vehicle travelling over the crest of the sand dune at sufficient speed for the vehicle to become airborne, fall down the face of the dune until it nose dived into sand and flip over forwards onto its roof like, as Mr Katsis said, one might see in a Hollywood movie. This was not the slow, cautious, pace suggested by the accused in his ERISP. Nor is it consistent with scenario suggested by Mr Dailly.

Tyre Tracks - Those That Were Seen and Those That Were Not Seen.

65I mentioned before that the evidence suggesting that the vehicle had been completely airborne, that is with all four wheels off the ground, after it went over the crest was supported by the absence of tyre tracks down the steep face of the dune. It is to that issue that I will now turn.

66The case for the Crown is that the vehicle was travelling at such speed as it went over the crest that the vehicle became completely airborne. The case for the accused is to the contrary. Through his lawyer he advances a version of events such that, at all times until the vehicle rolled over, at least the rear wheels were in contact with the sand. On the accused's version there must have been tyre tracks down the steep face of the sand dune leading up to the point where the vehicle flipped. On the Crown case there would not have been. 

67I will not go through the evidence of each witness on this issue in any detail but I can summarise the evidence regarding this issue very simply: No one gave evidence of seeing tyre tracks down the steep face of the dune leading to where the vehicle ended up; Many witnesses gave evidence of looking for tyre tracks down the steep face of the dune and not seeing any, including those who were attempting to determine what happened, or in more formal terms, the mechanism of the collision. The evidence is thus all one way - from a point in time relatively soon after the vehicle overturned, tyre tracks were not visible down the steep face of the dune. 

68The best evidence from Mr Dailly's point of view as regards tyre tracks came from Mr Hunter, a member of the New South Wales Fire Brigade. He was the only person to see tyre tracks anywhere on the steep face of the dune in the relevant area. He saw tyre track marks coming down maybe 12 inches or 300 millimetres from the top of the crest of the sand dune. But even he does not see tyre tracks anywhere else on the steep face of the dune. Mr Dailly concedes that even under his alternative scenario the rear wheels at least of the vehicle would have left tyre tracks much further down the steep face than those observed by Mr Hunter. 

69Mr Hunter's observations are consistent with the vehicle travelling through soft sand on the crest of the sand dune and becoming airborne. After all the wheels would not travel on the very top of the surface of the sand but would sink in some distance because of the soft nature of the sand. Perhaps more importantly as regards this aspect of the evidence however is Mr Hunter's observations that there were no tyre tracks further down the steep face of the sand dune as there would have been if any of the tyres of the vehicle remained in contact with the steep face. 

70Mr Dailly confronts this evidence concerning the absence of observations of tyre tracks by arguing in two ways. He first suggests that the tyre tracks which would have been there had been covered up by wind blown sand by the time people looked. The next aspect relies on what is known as the ""the angle of repose"" of the sand. 

71I will deal with the wind blown sand aspect first. One of the problems with that argument is that the first observation of the lack of tyre tracks was made almost immediately after the collision occurred. In considering what follows it must be borne in mind that the first triple O call was made at 5.04 pm. 

72Phillip Hillyer saw the vehicle on its roof and made a triple O call at 5.09 pm. He didn't see any tyre tracks leading to the location where the vehicle came to rest. This observation was made before any ambulance officers had arrived. 

73Ross Brown from the New South Wales Ambulance Service arrived at the gate at 5.26 pm and at the location of the upturned vehicle a short time later. He looked at the face of the sand dune and said ""there were no markings from the tyres at all on the wall of the dune"". In response to the suggestion made to him that it was not part of his duties to inspect the sand dune he said this:
When I arrive at any scene, after this amount of employment as an ambulance officer, you subconsciously assess the scene and more so at a vehicle accident for mechanism, as in what speed the vehicle was travelling to cause what injuries that may occur.


74Mr Floyd, a park employee, got a phone call at about 5.15 pm relating to the incident and took a couple of police officers who arrived at the entrance of the park to the location where the Suzuki was. When he was asked what he noticed he said:

I noticed an indentation where the vehicle had left the top of the dune and landed down, probably about three-quarters of the way down the dune. It looked to me it landed on its nose.

He did not see any other marks indicating contact between the vehicle and the sand between the top of the dune and the location where the vehicle had landed on its nose. He confirmed that evidence when he explained that he saw tyre marks going up the flatter face of the dune (sometimes referred to in the evidence as the approach side).  He said from what he could recall those track marks went ""to the top of the dune and then down that face there was nothing"". 

75Stephen Wright also from the New South Wales Fire Brigade conducted a ""scene assessment"" and didn't notice any tyre marks on the steep face of the sand dune. 

76So one thing can be easily found as a result of the preponderance of this evidence: there were no tyre tracks to be seen leading from the crest of the dune to the location where the Suzuki ended up on its roof despite a number of witnesses looking to see if there were any tyre tracks down the steep face of the dune and some of those witnesses making their observations very soon after the incident occurred.

77As I mentioned before Mr Dailly attempts to meet the obvious conclusion to be drawn from this evidence, that the vehicle was in fact airborne after it left the crest of the dune, by suggesting the possibility that the tyre tracks which the Suzuki would have left as it travelled down the face of the dune had been obliterated as sand was blown into the tracks, filling in indentations in the sand caused by the tyres. 

78There is no doubt that there was a strong wind that day. The Crown tendered meteorological data showing the winds being recorded at nearby weather stations. Almost all witnesses agreed with the proposition that there was a strong wind and indeed in some of the photographs taken after the sun had set, with the use of a flash, the light from the flash is reflected in airborne particles of sand. Mr Dailly relies on this evidence to suggest that tracks down the steep face of the dune would have been obliterated within a short time.

79No expert evidence was called as to the speed at which tyre tracks in sand dunes are covered up. From my experience of life, in the absence of expert evidence, I might have had some doubts as to whether tyre tracks would disappear as quickly as they must have for them to be obliterated by the time the witnesses looked for them, even in a very strong wind. However, fortunately, there is other evidence which means that I can put my own, possibly inaccurate, experience of life aside, which I do. 

80As well as there being clear evidence that no tyre tracks were visible down the steep face of the dune in the immediate vicinity of where the vehicle ended up, there was evidence that tyre tracks were visible on the flatter, approach side, of the dune and that these tracks were visible some hours after the vehicle overturned. No satisfactory explanation was advanced as to why if the behaviour of sand in strong winds was such that it would cover up tyre tracks in one area of the sand dune, it would not also cover up tracks in another area. And I repeat: Tyre tracks were not seen in the relevant area of the steep face of the dune by people who looked very soon after the incident, but were seen on the approach side of the dune some hours after it. 

81There are other relevant tyre tracks as well. As I mentioned no one saw tyre tracks down the steep face of the dune where there would have been tyre tracks if the vehicle had remained in contact with the steep face of the dune before it rolled forward onto its roof. But a photograph taken some hours later, as the vehicle was being turned back onto its wheels, shows tyre tracks in the steep face of the dune in the background. Those tyre tracks could only have been made before the vehicle overturned. Indeed I am satisfied that they were made by the accused's vehicle as he went over the sand dune on an occasion before the one which led to the collision. The evidence clearly established that the accused had traversed the relevant sand dune at least once before the collision occurred. Once more the conclusion is obvious. The strong wind cannot be an explanation for tyre tracks in the steep face of the dune being filled in in between the time at which the collision occurred and the time at which observations were made of the absence of tyre tracks leading up to the overturned vehicle.

82The second argument Mr Dailly puts to explain the absence of tyre tracks down the steep face of the dune concerns what is known as the ""angle of repose"" of loose sand. This is the angle beyond which sand ceases to be self- supporting. For this reason sand hills made out of loose sand can never be steeper than 35 degrees. A 36 degree sand dune composed of loose sand does not exist because the sand collapses until the 35 degree angle is reached.

83Mr Dailly says that tyre tracks might have been covered up immediately they were made because the angle of the indentation was greater than 35 degrees but this explanation must be rejected as well. Firstly it suffers from the same problem that I mentioned above when discussing the possibility that wind blown sand has covered up any tyre tracks in the steep face of the dune. The evidence was that other tyre tracks could be seen for some hours after the collision occurred and there is no explanation as to why the sand would collapse so that tyre tracks were not visible after only about 30 centimetres down the steep face of the dune. Secondly as I understand the expert evidence regarding the angle of repose the collapsing sand would not completely fill in an indentation caused by a tyre mark, merely make it slightly less obvious. The sand only collapses until it reaches the angle of repose, it does not keep collapsing until the surface becomes completely flat. 

84So the alternative hypothesis advanced by the accused suffers from the absence of tyre tracks. Another significant factor in addressing the alternative hypothesis concerns the location of the vehicle after it rolled onto its roof. It ended up at the very bottom of the sand dune. On the accused's alternative hypothesis the vehicle would have overturned quite high up on the dune and it was unlikely to have slid on its roof down to the bottom, especially given the absence of a hard roof which might have made it easier for the vehicle to slide inverted down the sand dune. 

85There are other problems with the alternative hypothesis. The Crown relied on the accused's driving before Mr Sayers alighted. There was evidence that suggested he drove recklessly. I have not found it necessary to take that into account. However in responding to the submissions from the Crown on that issue Mr Daily reminded me of the evidence of Mr David Hillyer. He observed the accused driving cautiously over a steep sand dune. It seems that this represented Mr Hillyer observing the accused's driving over the accident dune whilst Mr Sayer was still in the vehicle.

86This evidence also suggests the improbability of the accused's alternative scenario being accurate. Mr Hillyer saw the vehicle successfully do what it later unsuccessfully did. What appears to be different is the speed at which the accused drove, instead of proceeding ""cautiously"" he drove at about 22.6 kilometres per hour

87One of the factors relied on by Mr Dailly in support of his argument that the vehicle did not become airborne concerned the absence of damage to the front of the car, something that the experts noticed, as did I. The surface into which the vehicle nosedived was soft and some of the witnesses suggested that the initial point of contact between the vehicle and the sand below was at the vehicle's front wheels rather than the nose of the vehicle. These factors combine to reduce the weight which can be given to the absence of damage to the front of the car as a circumstance suggesting that it did not become airborne.

88Of course although I have been giving reasons as to why I conclude that the accused's alternative hypothesis is not a reasonably possible version of events I have in no way reversed the onus of proof. As I made clear earlier it is not for the accused to prove anything in this trial. It is not for him to prove that the alternative hypothesis that he advances is a reasonably possible version of what actually occurred. It is for the Crown to prove that it is not.

89Further I have not limited my examination of whether there is an explanation for what occurred that day in a way that is consistent with the accused's innocence to the particular scenario advanced by the accused through his counsel at trial or by the accused himself in his interview with police. I have considered all the evidence and examined whether there is another reasonably possible explanation other than the one advanced by the Crown. 

What is Dangerous Driving ?

90Although the Crown has charged the accused with two counts of driving in a manner dangerous to other persons rather than merely driving at a speed dangerous to other persons, of course the manner in which the accused drove includes the speed at which he was driving. The decision by the Crown to charge in that manner was, so I anticipate, because the Crown asserted other aspects of the accused's driving which were dangerous, namely driving over the sand dune, at whatever speed, in a vehicle without a hard top. 

91As it has turned out it is only necessary for me to examine the speed at which the accused was driving in order to conclude that he was driving in a manner dangerous. 

92The accused's manner of driving is relevantly dangerous if the Crown has established that it was potentially dangerous to another person or to other persons. In order for me to find the accused guilty I have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the manner of driving was such that it was a serious breach of the proper conduct of a motor vehicle, so serious as to be in reality, and not merely as a matter of speculation, potentially dangerous to another person or to other persons.


93Whether the accused was driving dangerously is an objective test and it matters not whether the accused thought that he was driving in a manner which was dangerous to another person or persons. The Crown does not have to prove that the accused thought it was a dangerous way in which to drive. The Crown does not have to establish that the accused knew or realised that he was driving the Suzuki in a dangerous manner.

94What matters is my assessment about the way in which he was driving - has the Crown proved to me beyond reasonable doubt that the manner in which the accused was driving immediately before the vehicle overturned was a manner which was dangerous to another person or persons?

95In answering that question I of course look at all the circumstances which applied at the relevant time. 

96Although there is a statutory defence provided under section 52A(8) the accused made no attempt to prove that there was no causal connection between the manner of his driving and the grievous bodily harm which was occasioned to Ms Free and Ms Crawford. Nor did the accused attempt to raise an honest but reasonable mistake as to any relevant fact.


97In deciding whether the accused has been shown to be guilty or not I have to examine whether the Crown has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that in a real sense, because of the particular way the accused drove that day, his manner of driving is potentially dangerous to another person or persons, in the circumstances of this case most relevantly, the passengers in his vehicle.

98One of the issues addressed by Mr Dailly in his submission concerned the fact that both Mr Joy and Dr Grzbieta expressed the opinion that the accused was travelling only slightly above the speed limit in that area. Mr Dailly relied on that circumstance as suggesting that that would be a factor which would lead me to conclude that driving at that speed was not dangerous. 

99A number of things need to be said. Firstly there was no evidence as to who determined that the speed limit in the park should be 20 kilometres an hour. This was a private park not a public road and, presumably, the owners of the park were entitled to determine that the speed limit would be whatever they chose. 

100Secondly, and much more importantly however, just because the speed limit in any area is 20 kilometres an hour it does not mean that a person is entitled to drive at that speed everywhere in that area, and in all circumstances, at the speed limit. The speed limit on a public road is the maximum that a driver can travel at without breaching those road rules concerning speeding. It says nothing about whether it is safe to travel at that speed in all conditions. As the Crown said in his submissions to me the fact that a roadway has a particular speed limit does not mean that it is not dangerous to drive around a hairpin bend at the maximum speed allowed. A driver must always be prepared to drive at a speed below the speed limit because the conditions in the particular area where the driver is travelling make it unsafe to travel at the speed limit.


The Accused Was Driving Dangerously

101As the accused drove his vehicle at such a speed that it became airborne as it came over the crest of the sand dune then he was driving in a manner dangerous to another person or persons. To drive a vehicle so that its tyres lose contact with the ground underneath as the vehicle goes over a crest with a substantial drop on the other side is clearly relevantly dangerous.

102Whilst it may not be dangerous driving to drive as the accused said he did to police in his ERISP (and I repeat this is an issue I need not resolve) it was clearly dangerous for the accused to drive at such a speed that the vehicle's momentum would be such that its tyres could not follow the profile of the sand dune remaining in contact with the ground at all times, in circumstances where there was a substantial vertical distance between the top of the dune and its base.

103It will be noted of course that I have not ascribed here a precise speed to the vehicle as it became airborne. This is because it largely does not matter. Whatever the precise speed was it was sufficient to cause the vehicle to become airborne. Thus whether the speed of the vehicle was 25 kilometres an hour or 22.6 kilometres an hour does not really matter. 

104Things might be perhaps different if there was a suggestion in the evidence of the experts that the accused may have been travelling at the speed he said he was travelling at when he was interviewed by police. In that case it would have been necessary for me to consider the second way in which the Crown said the accused was driving dangerously - namely by driving over such a steep sand dune. But, as it is agreed between the experts that the accused was travelling at at least 22.6 kilometres an hour, and as the experts do not cause me to disregard the observations of witnesses that the vehicle became airborne then I need not consider either of the alternative ways the Crown presents its case. 

105I repeat once more, the dangerous aspect of what the accused did was driving at a speed which caused his vehicle to become airborne in circumstances where there was a large vertical distance between the crest of the sand dune and its base which meant that the vehicle hit the sand nose first and then rotated on to its roof.

106There was a great deal of cogent and persuasive evidence from various sources against the accused. The eyewitness evidence was of itself enough to prove the accused's guilt. On top of that, the essential aspect of the eyewitness evidence, namely the way in which the vehicle got from the top of the crest to the bottom, was strongly supported by the evidence regarding the absence of tyre tracks where they should have been if the vehicle was not being driven dangerously. 

107The manner of the accused's driving, including the speed at which he travelled, was such as to cause the vehicle to become airborne as it went over the crest of the sand dune with the result that the vehicle rotated forwards and the accused could do nothing to prevent the vehicle falling under the influence of gravity, rotating as it did so, the significant vertical distance to where it hit the ground below. By causing the vehicle to become airborne the accused could not slow down its descent by using the brakes - in effect he had brought about a situation where he was unable to control the vehicle in any way whatsoever. And he brought about a situation where the vehicle would rotate as it flew through the air,

108This created a real danger to the passengers in his vehicle. Driving in such a way that the vehicle became airborne as it went over this sand dune was a serious breach of the proper conduct of the vehicle. This was such a serious breach as to be in reality potentially dangerous to the passengers in his vehicle. The accused caused a situation to come about where his vehicle fell through the air, rotating as it did so, without being in contact with the sand, and without the accused being able to arrest the descent of the vehicle until it collided with the sand at the base of the dune, its momentum causing it to then overturn. 

Other Evidence

109There is other evidence incriminating the accused which I have not yet mentioned. In once sense I don't need to mention it because I am able to conclude that the Crown has made out its case without referring to other evidence suggesting the accused's guilt. But lest it be thought that I have overlooked it, or perhaps even decided that it does not support what the Crown says, I will briefly mention some other aspects of the evidence. 


The Perceptions of Danger Felt by the Passengers in the Vehicle

110Ms Free gave evidence that immediately before the vehicle went over the sand dune and overturned she asked to get out of the vehicle. Her evidence was that she was scared by what the accused had just done and by what he was planning to do. She gave evidence that she didn't actually get out because Ms Crawford asked her to ""stay and hold my hand"". Ms Crawford gave evidence that she too was scared and asked to get out of the vehicle and that she remembered Ms Free asking the same thing. She said that the accused did not reply to her request and the next thing she remembers was the vehicle nose diving. 

111Of course such requests, if they were made, are relevant to sentence in the event that the accused is convicted but they also have some relevance to the perceived dangerousness of what the accused had been doing and was planning to do. 

112Mr Sayers gave evidence that whilst initially Ms Free asked to get out when he did, she changed her mind. This is broadly consistent with Ms Free's evidence. This suggests that Ms Crawford's recollection, clearly affected by the awful injuries she suffered, may have been faulty in a minor way. In any case there is evidence from three of the four people in the vehicle that day that immediately before it overturned Ms Free asked to get out, two of the witnesses, including Ms Free herself, explaining that she didn't do so after changing her mind. That is some evidence as to the dangerousness of what they could see the accused was planning to do. It is not the strongest evidence suggesting his guilt of course but it does point in that direction. I have to repeat however that even in the absence of this evidence my conclusion as to the accused's guilt would have been the same. 

The accused's statement to Ms Crawford as she lay injured on the sand 

113Ms Crawford gave evidence that as she was lying injured on the sand the accused approached her and said ""I'm sorry, please don't tell anyone"". Quite understandably given her understanding of the injuries she had suffered her evidence was that she responded in a rather forceful way.

114Whilst the words ""I'm Sorry"" could not safely be said to be an admission, the words, ""please don't tell anyone"" are clearly capable of being interpreted as an admission of wrongdoing - why else would the accused ask Ms Crawford not to tell anyone something?

115In cross-examination it was put to Ms Crawford that that conversation had not occurred but she confirmed that it had. 

116The resolution of whether the accused did in fact say what Ms Crawford said he said is inter-related with many other issues. The officer who interviewed the accused on 14 February 2009 did not ask him whether that conversation had occurred. The reasons for that are obvious. The evidence is that Ms Crawford made her statement to police on the 1st of April 2009 and so at the time the police interviewed the accused they would not have known that Ms Crawford's version of events included that conversation. The result is that the accused has not denied saying to Ms Crawford ""I'm sorry, please don't tell anyone"" but he was not given the chance during his ERSIP.

117I am prepared to find that the accused probably did say those words and that they represent an acknowledgment by him that he had done something he should not have done. But once more I did not need to have made this finding in order to reach the conclusion that I have regarding the accused's guilt

What Mr Sayers was Alleged to Have Said the Accused Was Going To Do.

118Matthew Tyler gave evidence of a conversation he had with Mr Sayers after the latter got out of the Suzuki and waited at the base of the sand dune with a camera. Mr Tyler said that he walked up and said to him ""what's going on mate? What are you doing?"" to which Mr Sayers replied, ""he's going to try and jump that sand dune over there"". 

119That evidence was admitted without objection. It is clearly relevant because a person who has been told that something dramatic is about to happen is more likely to focus his or her attention on what he or she has been told is about to occur, than a person who is taken by surprise. That might explain why no objection was taken, but there was no application made that I limit the use of that evidence in so far as it might be categorised as an admission by hearsay. Were there a jury I would give the jury a direction under section 165 of the Evidence Act. I would tell them that the evidence may be unreliable and that there is a need for them to exercise caution before they accept it. I would explain that one of the reasons for this need for caution is that what Mr Sayers said that the accused said to him was not a statement made on oath in the solemn atmosphere of a Courtroom. Were it necessary I would give myself that warning in the course of this judgment. However this is one area where I simply do not need to decide whether or not Mr Sayers said those words and if he did whether or not the accused had told him what Mr Sayers said he had told him. 

120In cross-examination of Mr Tyler it was made clear that Mr Tyler had not said to police that Mr Sayers told him that the accused was going to ""jump that sand dune"" when he made his statement to police on 11th February 2009. And Mr Sayers denied making such a statement when he gave evidence. In those circumstances, and in a case where the guilt of the accused is otherwise proved overwhelmingly, without suggesting at all that I have made a finding that Mr Tyler was mistaken, I need not resolve the question as to whether Mr Sayers said what Mr Tyler gave evidence that he had said. 

Conclusion

121To summarise, I have found that the accused drove at such a speed, at least 22.6 kilometres per hour, that his vehicle became airborne as it crested the sand dune causing it to rotate forwards as it fell until it struck the ground and flipped over on to its roof, thereby causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Free and Ms Crawford. In summary I have found that the vehicle became airborne because eyewitnesses saw that happen, there were no relevant tyre tracks in the steep face of the dune whilst there were tyre tracks visible elsewhere, and neither expert suggests that it was impossible for the vehicle to become airborne, indeed one expert saying that was highly likely. 

122I have found beyond reasonable doubt that driving at such a speed as to cause the vehicle to become airborne in all the circumstances amounted to driving in a manner which was dangerous to another person or persons. Accordingly I find the accused guilty on both counts.

2The trial judge subsequently sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of three years and six months commencing on 8 April 2011, with a non-parole period of eight months.

3Before dealing with the appellant's grounds of appeal against his convictions, it is necessary to refer to the factual circumstances that gave rise to the charges against him.

FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

The Fincorp Group

4The Fincorp Group of companies obtained investments from the public by offering secured and unsecured notes through prospectuses issued in 2002, 2003 and 2005. The funds were raised by Fincorp Investments Ltd and lent to another company in the Group, Guardian Mortgages Pty Ltd (""Guardian""), which in turn lent the funds to other companies in the Group or to unrelated entities. Southern Cross Investments Pty Ltd (""Southern Cross""), Alliance Properties Pty Ltd (""Alliance Properties"") and Bridgewater Developments Pty Ltd (""Bridgewater"") were Group companies involved in the Group's business of acquiring and developing property. Bridgewater did not itself purchase any property but it provided the Group property companies with management and property development services. Capital First Investments Pty Ltd was the parent company of the property arm of the Group. The sole formally-appointed director of Bridgewater was Mr Colin McIlveen. The Crown contended at the trial that the appellant was a de facto director of Bridgewater and the appellant did not dispute that (Appellant's Written Submissions, footnote 5). Mr McIlveen was the sole director of Southern Cross. The appellant and Mr McIlveeen were the directors of Alliance Properties. The directors of Fincorp Investments and Guardian were the appellant, Mr Jacob Quigley and Mr Darryl Benn.

5The shares in the Group companies were, directly or indirectly, wholly owned by the United Investment Trust (the ""Trust""), of which Trek Consulting Services Pty Ltd (""Trek Consulting"") was the trustee. The appellant was the sole director of Trek Consulting and the appellant and his wife were its only shareholders. The diagram that was attached to a Statement of Facts agreed between the parties identified various members of the appellant's family, but not the appellant, as beneficiaries of the Trust.

6Mr Quigley was the Chief Accounting Officer of the Group. Mr McIlveen was engaged by the Group in 2002 or 2003 to create a portfolio of properties for it.

7PriceWaterhouseCoopers (""PWC"") were the auditors of the Group and Mr Adrian Bunter was the audit manager. The shares in Crest Capital Pty Ltd (""Crest Capital""), referred to in Count 1 of the Indictment against the appellant (see [1] above), were owned by the appellant. Prime Consulting Group Pty Ltd (""Prime Consulting""), referred to in Count 3, was a company owned by the appellant's brother, Mr John Krecichwost and John's wife Angela Krecichwost. John Krecichwost was the sole director.

The $900,000 and $825,000 transactions of 1 September 2003 (Counts 1 and 2)

8Soon after their advertisement for sale in June 2003, Mr McIlveen identified adjoining properties at 235 Epping Road and 220 Harvest Home Road, Wollert, Victoria (the ""Epping Properties""), as potential development acquisitions for the Fincorp Group. The properties comprised two large areas of land suitable for residential subdivision.

9Mr McIlveen gave evidence that he made inquiries to evaluate the properties and negotiated the purchases on the appellant's instructions. He said that when he commenced work with the Group, the appellant had made it clear to him that the appellant ""had no experience in development and he was relying upon [Mr McIlveen] to fill that role"" (Transcript 9/2/11 p 31). Mr McIlveen formed the view that the properties could be profitably developed but would not generate a profit for at least five years (Transcript 9/2/11, p 39).

10On 25 July 2003 Southern Cross purchased 235 Epping Road for $14.5 M and on 8 August 2003 it purchased 220 Harvest Home Road for $13.75 M. Mr McIlveen signed both contracts of sale on behalf of Southern Cross.

11On 1 September 2003 Fincorp Investments paid $900,000 to Bridgewater by way of a cheque signed by the appellant and Mr Quigley (see Count 1). On the same day, by cheque signed by the appellant and Mr McIlveen, Bridgewater paid $825,000 to the appellant (see Count 2). The accounting records of the Group identified the latter payment as being in satisfaction of an invoice dated 1 September 2003 for $750,000 plus $75,000 GST issued by Crest Capital to Southern Cross. This invoice purported to be for ""Commission/Management Fees on Epping Road/Harvest Home Road Projects"". Mr McIlveen gave evidence that he was not aware of any entitlement of Crest Capital to commission or management fees in relation to the properties and he did not recall discussing with the appellant this invoice or any payment for services of that character. Nor did he recall signing the cheque drawn by Bridgewater, although he accepted that his signature appeared on it. Mr Stephen Hay, the vendors' real estate agent, gave evidence that he had not had dealings with anyone representing Crest Capital in connection with the properties (Transcript 9/2/11, p 84).

12The appellant gave the following evidence about a conversation in late August 2003 between himself and Mr Quigley which preceded the two payments:

""Q. What did you say to Jacob Quigley?
A. At that point, certainly I was not on wages. I hadn't earnt any wages at all from any of the Fincorp companies or any of the property companies. We were talking about becoming employees on 1 September 2003, and I had a discussion with Jacob about the fact that I had done work for approximately two years. I'd contributed equity of $500,000 in the establishment of Fincorp, and prior to that I'd spent some close to $250,000 in the set-up of the entire Group, and that was advice, software and a number of other things. So I had a discussion with Jacob about being remunerated for that. In broad terms, we agreed on a figure of obviously - now we also discussed at the time that the properties had increased in value substantially. At that point, Jacob agreed that a payment could be made, should be made. He discussed it with John [Krecichwost], or I discussed it with John. I can't remember the circumstance. Not that I needed John's approval, but out of courtesy we did that, and I think Adrian Bunter was in the office on 28 August, doing an audit as part of the 2003 audit ... "" (Transcript 10/2/11, pp 192 - 3).

13The appellant said that he and Mr Quigley discussed the possibility of the appellant receiving $750,000 and Mr Quigley later reported that he had informed Mr Bunter of his discussion with the appellant ""with respect to back pay"". The appellant then said, ""I'd obviously done work on both the property side and on the Fincorp side, approximately two years where I hadn't been on salary or wages ... and [Mr Quigley] also said that there was significant start-up costs with respect to the incorporation of Fincorp and all that"". The appellant asserted that Mr Bunter's response had been: ""Take a management fee from one of the property companies"" (Transcript 10/2/11, pp 193 - 4).

14The appellant later gave evidence that he believed the payment to him of $750,000 was legitimate for the following reasons:

""Well, on the fact that (1) the profits of the Group - well, of the Group entirely, but also of Epping - had gone up substantially. I owned 100% of the company, and we'd sought the advice of Adrian Bunter, who was the auditor from PricewaterhouseCoopers, who was in the office in the week preceding the payment"" (Transcript 11/2/11, p 3).

15The appellant said that at the time of the payment of $825,000 to him ""there was no invoice prepared to correspond with the payment being made"" (Transcript 11/2/11, p 5). He denied knowledge of the circumstances in which Crest Capital's invoice for $825,0000 in ""commission/management fees"" was brought into existence (Transcript 11/2/11, p 6).

16Note 20 to the Financial Report for Capital First Investments Pty Ltd and Controlled Entities, forming part of the Fincorp Group's 2005 prospectus, stated, by way of disclosure of related party transactions, that in the 12 months to 30 June 2004, Crest Capital ""was paid spotters [sic] fees of $750,000 by wholly-owned Group companies for the identification of property deals"". The appellant accepted in cross-examination that this statement was incorrect (Transcript 11/2/11, p 19).

17Mr Bunter gave evidence that another member of the PWC audit team worked on this item in the Financial Report and that he could not recall what inquiries had been made concerning it (Transcript 9/2/11, p 109). He also said that he could not recall having had a conversation with Mr Quigley concerning the spotter's fees of $750,000. When pressed, he said that he may have had such a conversation but he did not believe that he had (Transcript 10/2/11, p 139). Mr Bunter also said that in evidence he gave at the appellant's committal hearing regarding a discussion he had had with Mr Quigley concerning payment to the appellant ""in arrears for work he'd done for the Group"" he had mistakenly referred to August 2003 rather than October 2003 (Transcript 10/2/11, p 136).

The $1.98 M transaction of 27 October 2003 (Count 3)

18In July 2003 Mr McIlveen inspected a property in Mernda, Victoria (the ""Doreen Property""). He subsequently recommended to the appellant that the Fincorp Group purchase it for development purposes. On the appellant's instructions, Mr McIlveen commenced negotiations for the purchase, however the negotiations were completed by the appellant and Mr Quigley as Mr McIlveen had to attend hospital at short notice. Contracts for purchase of the property for $22.5 M were exchanged on 10 September 2003, with Alliance Properties nominated as the purchaser.

19The appellant gave evidence that in the first or second week of October 2003, he and Mr Quigley discussed the possibility of distributing 10 per cent of what they regarded as a $20 M increase in the value of the properties in the Fincorp Group (Transcript 11/2/11, p 8). They discussed the division of the $2 M distribution in accordance with previously agreed profit shares, being 75 per cent for the appellant, 15 per cent for his brother John and 5 per cent for each of Mr Quigley and a nephew of the appellant. The appellant said that they discussed a number of options to facilitate this, including the sale of the Epping Properties on which the appellant believed that $10 M profit could be realised. However, Mr McIlveen, to whom this suggestion had also been put, regarded any sale of the Epping Properties as premature because they were likely to yield further significant profits in the future. The appellant later accepted Mr McIlveen's view (Transcript 11/2/11, p 9).

20These discussions were reflected in a document that Mr Quigley prepared and showed to the appellant (Transcript 11/2/11, p 10). The document included the following statements: 

""Requirements: Get money out of company for 'Comfort Zone' to shareholders and breathing space to create and operate sound corporate practices.

Ethics/Opinions:

Always take profits after making profit on paper

...

We know that we have made a bit of profit so we need to keep some for the ""company"" comfort as well as give some for involved parties comfort"".

21The document was attached to an email dated 15 October 2003 from an employee of the Fincorp Group to Mr Quigley requesting that Mr Quigley let her know when he had received the email so that she could delete it from her computer. Mr Quigley responded on 15 October 2003, writing ""You are right to delete this"".

22After the document had been provided to the appellant, Mr Quigley spoke to Mr Bunter at the appellant's request. Mr Quigley later informed the appellant that Mr Bunter ""had simply advised him to take the payment as a spotter's fee"" and Mr Quigley intended to send Mr Bunter an email summarising their discussion (Transcript 11/2/11, p 13). 

23The subsequent email, which was seen by the appellant and dated 20 October 2003, relevantly said:

""Further to discussions last week:

*The Development side of the business has generated conservatively 20mil in NMV increases.

*To provide some reward to involved parties (and a buffer zone in which we can setup strict payout practices) we will be withdrawing up to 2 mil in spotters fees. These fees will be invoiced by a singular vehicle from which a group of parties can draw. This entity will need to be registered for GST and SCI (Epping Land Owner) can claim the credit"".

24On 27 October 2003, $1,980,000 was paid by Fincorp Finance Ltd, a Group company, to Prime Consulting, by way of a cheque signed by the appellant and Mr Quigley (see Count 3). These funds were subsequently distributed by Prime Consulting in the agreed profit shares, including a payment of $1,485,000 to the appellant.

25The appellant gave the following evidence concerning his belief in the legitimacy of the payment to Prime Consulting:

""I believed it to be totally legitimate. We had - I owned 100% of the company. Again, the properties had gone up substantially in value. I was in a position and I had the authority to make a 10% profit share arrangement to Colin McIlveen, who didn't have an interest in the company and didn't own any of the shares in the company, and I seemed - it deemed to be entirely appropriate to make such a payment to myself. The profits belonged to me, they were only going to be distributed to me"" (Transcript 11/2/11, p 16).

26Note 20, which appeared in the 2005 prospectus and is referred to in [16] above, contained the following statement concerning related party transactions:

""During the period Prime Consulting Group Pty Ltd was paid spotters fees of $1,800,000 by wholly-owned group companies for the identification of property deals"".

27In cross-examination the appellant agreed that this statement was incorrect (Transcript 11/2/11, p 20).

28Mr Bunter gave the following evidence of discussions, apparently in October 2003, relevant to the $1.98 M payment:

""Q. ... Do you remember there being discussions [prior to preparation of the year end financial report] in relation to that topic?
A. I remember there being discussions that if people involved in identifying property transactions that were purchased on, you know, like on a good deal for the business that had resulted in significant increases in values, that they would reward those people for those transactions, for bringing those properties to the attention of the company and help [sic] negotiate those deals.

Q. Had you expressed a view about the appropriateness of taking that course?
A. My consideration was more in relation to the accounting for the transactions, and making sure that they were appropriately dealt with and disclosed in the accounts, and this was a - on the face of it, a prospective thing that was going to happen in the future.

Q. Did you indicate one way or the other whether that practice ought to be adopted?
A. No, I mean, that's a business practice for the company and how they run their business and how they incentivise people to bring them deals"" (Transcript 9/2/11, p 110).

29He said that these discussions ""would have been"" with Mr Quigley. In re-examination he explained both his reference to the concept of paying people ""involved in a particular business"" and his understanding of the term ""spotter's fee"":

""Q. What were you intending to mean by referring to your approval to the general concept of paying people who were involved in a particular business?
A. To be involved, they needed to be, for the acquisitions, actively involved in, you know, either identifying the property, helping negotiate the deal for the company, bringing that to the company's attention or the Group's attention to acquire that property. So active involvement in the business.

Q. The term's [sic] 'spotter's fee' has been used from time to time. What did you understand that to mean in the context of a particular property?
A. The person or business who actually went out and identified the property and actually brought that to the attention for the Group, and may have helped with acquiring that business or that property"" (Transcript 10/2/11, p 142).

30I turn now to consider the appellant's grounds of appeal.

GROUND 1: THERE HAS BEEN A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IN THE TRIAL AS A RESULT OF FRESH EVIDENCE

31The fresh evidence upon which the appellant relies is that given by Mr Bunter and Mr McIlveen, after the appellant's trial, at Mr Quigley's trial. Mr Quigley was charged with an offence, concerning the payment of 27 October 2003, corresponding to that with which the appellant was charged under count 3. Mr Quigley and the appellant, directors of Fincorp Investments Ltd, both signed the cheque for $1.98 M (see [24] above). Mr Quigley, however, was acquitted on 17 May 2011. The appellant contends that these witnesses gave evidence at Mr Quigley's trial that conflicted with evidence they had given at the appellant's trial or made concessions at the later trial that they had not made at the appellant's trial.

Relevant principles of law

32The principles applicable where new or fresh evidence is relied upon were summarised in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]. In essence, even assuming that the evidence relied upon by the appellant is fresh evidence (that is, evidence not actually or constructively available to the appellant at the time of his trial), appellate intervention on that basis would only follow a conclusion of this Court that there was a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if this evidence had been admitted at his trial. If the evidence is not fresh in this sense, an appeal court will not intervene unless it is ""of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt"" (ibid).

33As the fresh evidence relied upon includes statements by two witnesses called at the appellant's trial which are alleged to contradict or at least differ from their earlier evidence at the appellant's trial, the decision in Davies v R [1937] HCA 27; 57 CLR 170 is relevant. In that case, the Court said:

""A declaration by a witness that he has committed perjury cannot possibly be accepted as a ground in itself for setting aside the result of a trial in which the witness has given evidence. If the contrary were held, the whole administration of both civil and criminal justice would be undermined. The subsequent discovery that some evidence (as in this case) is said by the witness who gave it to be false, or is actually proved to be false, cannot, as a general rule, be allowed as a ground in itself for setting aside a verdict or judgment. But if the verdict is open to objection upon a ground affected by such evidence, the case is different. It would not be wise to attempt to frame a universal rule even for such cases. As the Full Court indicates in its judgment, the subsequent statement that the original evidence is false may be explainable by pressure brought to bear upon a witness or by the operation of any one of an indefinite number of motives. Each case should be treated in relation to its own facts"" (at pp 183 - 4).

Mr Bunter's evidence

34The appellant first relied upon the following evidence given by Mr Bunter at Mr Quigley's trial:

""Q. Mr Bunter, you recall that when you gave evidence last Wednesday and Thursday, you were asked some questions about a meeting you had with Mr Quigley on 16 October 2003.
A. Yes, I do.

Q. I want to ask you this question. During that meeting, did you give him advice that probably the best way to pay a draw-down of profits would be to pay it as a spotter's fee and to remunerate people for their efforts?
A. No, I don't believe I gave that advice.

Q. During that meeting, was it you or Mr Quigley that first used the phrase 'spotter's fee'?
A. I don't recall who specifically first said that.

Q. During that meeting, did you say to him, 'You can use the words 'spotter's fee'. That's a term we will use in the accounts to describe all of the work done on the property side, and the fee taken to reward you for that work.'
A. I don't believe so"" (Transcript 11/5/11, p 413).

35The appellant submitted that the fact that Mr Bunter ""as the auditor may have raised the topic of 'spotter's fees' is consistent with the [appellant's] evidence that he (and Quigley) were acting on the advice of Bunter in that regard"" (Written Submissions [52]). However I do not see any significant possibility that if Mr Bunter had given evidence in these terms at the appellant's trial, the jury, for that reason, would have acquitted the appellant. The thrust of Mr Bunter's evidence at the appellant's trial was that he was asked by Mr Quigley whether it was appropriate that payments be made to reward individuals for work that they had done in relation to specific property acquisitions by companies in the Fincorp Group (see [28] - [29] above). Even if (contrary to the belief expressed by Mr Bunter at Mr Quigley's trial) Mr Bunter was the first to use the phrase ""spotter's fee"" to describe a reward of that character, that would not contradict his evidence at the appellant's trial as to the nature of the advice sought from and given by him. It would not have indicated that the effect of his advice was that ""spotter's fees"" could be paid to make profit distributions, whether or not the recipients had done work that justified such payments.

36Secondly, the appellant relied upon the following evidence given by Mr Bunter at Mr Quigley's trial:

""Q. By the way, was it someone in PWC or someone within Fincorp who actually drafted the related party note [see [16] and [26] above]?
A. I don't recall. What normally happens in the accounts is often they're drafted by the company but the auditor will then assist with clarifying and detailing the makeup of it. The related party note is one of those ones that's actually quite a complex one to draft so normally some assistance is provided to that so we could have drafted that"" (Transcript 4/5/11, p 175).

37Again I do not consider that if this evidence had been given at the appellant's trial that there is any significant possibility that the jury would for that reason have acquitted the appellant. The fact that the auditors might have drafted the Note, whether based upon the discussion in October 2003 between Mr Bunter and Mr Quigley or upon subsequent information, does not diminish the significance of the Note as part of accounts whose accuracy the appellant certified (Transcript 11/2/11, p 19). The appellant did not deny knowledge of the Note.

38Thirdly, the appellant relied on appeal upon evidence given by Mr Bunter at Mr Quigley's trial that he did not keep a note of his meeting with Mr Quigley in October, that it was very difficult for him to remember what was actually said at that meeting and that the first time he was asked to give an account of that meeting was five years after it had occurred. It was open to the appellant's counsel to question Mr Bunter on these topics at the appellant's trial but he chose not to do so. In these circumstances, the evidence cannot, in my view, be regarded as ""fresh evidence"" that was not reasonably available to the appellant at his trial. Thus, the hurdle that the appellant must surmount on appeal is high (see [32] above). As the evidence did not differ significantly from the evidence given by Mr Bunter at the appellant's trial of his difficulty recalling various matters upon which he was questioned and the inferences that could reasonably be drawn from his evidence (for example, that he did not keep notes of the relevant meeting), my view is that there is no significant possibility that if this further evidence had been adduced at the appellant's trial, that he would have been acquitted.

Mr McIlveen's evidence

39At the appellant's trial, Mr McIlveen said that he did not recall seeing the email of 20 October 2003, but that he must have received it. He was not questioned about the email in cross-examination. At Mr Quigley's trial Mr McIlveen said, ""I think I must have read it because I read most of the stuff like this"", and he ""probably"" discussed it with Mr Quigley and ""would have thought"" he discussed it with the appellant (Transcript 3/5/11, p 39).

40This evidence given by Mr McIlveen at Mr Quigley's trial neither conflicted with, nor materially added to, the evidence given by him at the appellant's trial. It is not surprising that if Mr McIlveen had received the email he might, as he speculated at Mr Quigley's trial, have discussed it with Mr Quigley and the appellant. The appellant's counsel had the opportunity to question Mr McIlveen about this at the appellant's trial if he had thought it was advisable.

41The appellant also submitted that Mr McIlveen's evidence at Mr Quigley's trial that he ""would have thought"" that he had discussed the contents of the email with the appellant and Mr Quigley was inconsistent with his evidence at the appellant's trial that he had not discussed with anyone the payment to Prime Consulting Group of a fee in relation to the acquisition of the Doreen Property (9/2/11 Transcript, pp 44 - 5). 

42I do not agree that there was any such inconsistency. The email did not specifically refer to the Doreen Property and did not contain any reference to Prime Consulting Group. Moreover Mr McIlveen's evidence at Mr Quigley's trial did not suggest that he had any actual recollection of discussing the contents of the email with the appellant and Mr Quigley. In these circumstances, I do not consider that this evidence of Mr McIlveen would have assumed any particular significance if given at the appellant's trial. 

43For the reasons I have given, this ground of appeal should be rejected.

GROUND 2: THE TRIAL MISCARRIED AS A RESULT OF IRRELEVANT BUT PREJUDICIAL MATERIAL BEING CONTAINED IN EXHIBIT C, THE JURY BOOK

44At the outset of the trial the Crown tendered two lever arch folders described as a jury book. The appellant submitted that this jury book contained irrelevant but prejudicial material comprising:

(a) ""ASIC searches in relation to each of the companies which showed that the companies had gone into external administration"".

(b) ""Banking statements (or documentation as to expenditure) which refer[red] to transactions which were not in any way relevant ... "".

45However the jury book was tendered by consent and at no stage did the appellant take an objection to any part of it or request that the trial judge give a direction to the jury concerning it. As a result, the appellant requires leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise this ground.

46I do not consider that that leave should be granted. So far as the ASIC searches are concerned, there was in any event evidence before the jury about the appointment of administrators. No objection was taken to that evidence, nor was any direction sought about it. Further, I do not consider that the jury could reasonably have regarded any of the (irrelevant) transactions revealed by the bank statements as of any significance. The lack of objection and request for a direction confirms this to be the case. 

47This ground of appeal should be rejected.

GROUND 3: THERE HAS BEEN A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE AS A RESULT OF THE TRIAL PROCEEDING ON AN ERRONEOUS LEGAL BASIS AS TO WHEN A COMPANY MAY DECLARE A DIVIDEND

48The appellant submitted that the Crown case at trial was that the appellant had devised a scheme to disguise the subject payments as ""spotter's fees"" because the Fincorp Group companies were not entitled to declare dividends as no profit had yet been realised on the purchased properties. He submitted that this approach incorrectly assumed that a company cannot declare a dividend out of unrealised capital appreciation, with the result that the jury was left with the mistaken impression that the appellant had had an improper motive for causing the payments to be made (Written Submissions [78] - [81]).

49The first answer to this submission is that it was the appellant's beliefs that determined his motive, irrespective of whether they reflected the actual position at law. Thus, a view by the appellant that the payments could not be made by way of dividend would, even if mistaken as a matter of law, provide an explanation, or motive, for the appellant's allegedly dishonest conduct in causing the subject payments to be made purportedly for commission or fees when he knew that neither he nor any of the recipients of the payments had provided services to justify the payment of such commission or fees.

50It was in my view open to the jury to accept the Crown's submission that the reason, or at least one reason, why the payments were made was the appellant's belief that they could not lawfully be distributed by way of dividend. In his explanation of his belief in the legitimacy of the payments (see [14], [25] above), the appellant did not suggest that they were in fact payments of dividends or could equally, and lawfully, have been made by way of dividend.

51The second answer to the appellant's submission is that it is of no assistance to him to point out that the law recognises that, in some circumstances, increases in the value of fixed assets may give rise to profits distributable by way of dividend, if, as I have found, those circumstances did not exist in the present case at the time the payments were made. The reasons that these circumstances did not exist are as follows.

52First, the determination of profit involves a comparison between the state of a business at the beginning and end of a relevant financial period (In re the Spanish Prospecting Company Ltd [1911] 1 Ch 92 at 98; [1908-10] All ER Rep 573; QBE Insurance Group Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 38 FCR 270 at 284).

53The companies in the Fincorp Group prepared accounts on the basis of financial years commencing 1 July. The subject properties were acquired early in the year commencing 1 July 2003 and the subject payments were made in the months that followed, long before the conclusion of the financial year and the determination of profit. Thus, at the time of the payments there had been no determination at all of the profit for the relevant year, much less one that reflected the alleged increases in value of the properties.

54Secondly, the uncontradicted accounting evidence of Mr Bunter was that, as the relevant companies were development companies, the subject properties were accounted for as inventory (that is stock-in-trade rather than fixed assets) and that, as a matter of accounting convention, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The effect of his evidence was that these properties could not have been revalued in the accounts to reflect their increase in value and to give rise to a profit distributable by way of dividend. Mr Bunter's evidence is significant as courts have repeatedly emphasised the importance of the views of the accounting profession in considering issues of this nature (Deputy Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of SA Ltd (Carden's Case) (1938) 63 CLR 108 at 153 - 4; QBE Insurance v Australian Securities Commission at 288 - 9; Clark v Inglis [2010] NSWCA 144; 79 ATR 447 at [39]).

55Thirdly, even leaving aside the fact that the properties were held as inventory rather than as fixed assets, none of the steps necessary to facilitate payment of a dividend out of profits arising from an increase in the value of the properties had been taken at the time the payments were made (nor were they taken at all in the relevant financial year). The steps required would have been a revaluation of the properties, a resolution of the directors to reflect the revaluation in the property companies' accounts and a transfer of the increase in value to the profit and loss account.

56Whilst unrealised capital gains may form part of a company's profits, for that to occur it is necessary that the gains reflect ""a valuation made in good faith by competent valuers"" (Dimbula Valley (Ceylon) Tea Co Ltd v Laurie [1961] Ch 353 at 372; and see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] HCA 70; 225 CLR 488 at [49]). The appellant submitted that an independent valuer might not always be required (referring to R P Austin and I M Ramsay, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law, LexisNexis Butterworths, 14th ed (2010) at 991). Even if this were so and the directors could themselves undertake a revaluation, the evidence does not suggest that this occurred in the present case. 

57So far as the second step is concerned, the evidentiary references on this topic given by the appellant in his Written Submission of 10 April 2012 did not indicate that by the time of the subject payments (or at any later time) the directors of the relevant companies had resolved that the subject properties, or indeed any of the properties held by Group companies, be revalued in the accounts. The balance sheets of Southern Cross and Alliance Properties showed that the subject properties were still recorded at cost in the respective books of account at 30 June 2004, without any recognition of their alleged increased value. 

58The appellant included in his list a reference to a document entitled ""Business Plan: October 2003"" prepared by Mr Peter Pengilley of Investment Dynamics Pty Ltd. It referred to the Group's property portfolio as having a current value of $82.27 M, as compared to its total purchase price of $62.05 M, but it is not clear from the document whether Mr Pengilley was a valuer and the terms of the document suggest that it was a draft only. In any event, as I have noted, the asset appreciation it suggests was never reflected in a resolution of the directors to revalue the properties in the books of account. The appellant also referred to various valuation reports but these were dated long after the subject payments were made, the first being dated 25 June 2004.

59Even if there had been a decision by the directors, based on proper valuations, to revalue the subject properties in the companies' books of account, any increase in value would have had to be transferred to the profit and loss account for the profits to be available for distribution by dividend (see Industrial Equity Ltd v Blackburn (1977) 2 ACLR 421 at 426). The balance sheets at 30 June 2004 indicate that this did not occur by the time of the subject payments, nor in fact prior to 30 June 2004. 

60For these reasons this ground of appeal must fail. Moreover, because the ground relates to directions which the appellant did not seek at trial, the appellant is precluded, unless the Court grants leave, from relying upon this ground by rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. In light of the views I have expressed above, there is no reason why the Court should grant leave to rely upon it.

GROUND 4: THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO DIRECT THE JURY OF FACTORS RELEVANT TO ITS CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE CONDUCT WAS DISHONEST 

61The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the following matters were relevant to the jury's consideration of the issue of dishonesty:

""(1) The profitability of the company;
(2) That it was solvent at the time of the alleged offences;
(3) That there was no evidence that any person or the company sustained any detriment; and
(4) That the payment was authorised by the sole shareholder"".

62These factors reflect those referred to in the judgment of Gleeson CJ and Heydon J in Angas Law Services Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Carabelas [2005] HCA 23; 226 CLR 507 at [29], a case concerned with a charge against directors under s 229(4) of the Companies (South Australia) Code of making improper use of their positions to gain an advantage for themselves or others, or to cause detriment to the corporation. At Mr Quigley's trial, his counsel requested directions to the effect of those referred to in [61] above and the trial judge obliged. As no such directions were sought at the appellant's trial, the appellant requires leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground of appeal.

63As the trial judge directed the jury, the issue of the appellant's dishonesty needed to be judged by the jury according to ""the standards of ordinary, decent people"" (see Peters v R [1998] HCA 7; 192 CLR 493 at [18]). Such judgment required the jury to consider the wide variety of circumstances revealed by the evidence. Unsurprisingly, the experienced counsel who appeared for the appellant addressed the jury at length in relation to the issue of dishonesty. In her Summing-Up the trial judge referred in detail to the appellant's evidence and his counsel's submissions on the topic. The appellant does not allege that her Honour's descriptions were inaccurate or deficient.

64In these circumstances it does not in my view avail the appellant to contend for the first time on appeal that there were other matters relevant to the jury's determination of whether the appellant had acted dishonestly which should have been drawn to the jury's attention. Factors that are relevant to a determination of dishonesty, and their degree of importance, vary according to the circumstances of each case. The appellant was well-represented at the trial and it is too late for him to say that reference should have been made by his counsel, and consequently by the trial judge in her Summing-Up, to factors other than those mentioned by counsel in his forceful address at the trial.

65Neither in Angas Law Services nor elsewhere is there to be found any prescription of the factual matters that must be taken into account by a finder of fact in determining whether a person has been dishonest. The fact that at Mr Quigley's trial, in the particular circumstances of that case, the trial judge, at the request of Mr Quigley's counsel, referred to factual matters different to those referred to in the Summing-Up at the appellant's trial does not indicate a deficiency in that Summing-Up.

66The appellant has not, in my view, shown any reason why leave should be granted under r 4 to rely upon this ground. I therefore hold that he is not entitled to rely upon it.

GROUND 5: THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO DIRECT THE JURY THAT THE RELEVANT TIME AT WHICH TO CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF DISHONESTY WAS WHEN THE CHEQUES WERE SIGNED

67As evidence of dishonesty the Crown relied heavily upon the allegedly misleading description of the payments in subsequent documents, particularly the 2005 prospectus (see [16], [26] - [27] above). The appellant submitted that in the absence of a direction to the jury that dishonesty had to be determined as at the date of the impugned payments, the jury may have wrongly assumed that proof of subsequent dishonesty was sufficient.

68In my view however it would have been obvious to the jury that it was required to focus upon the appellant's state of mind at the time the cheques were drawn, as counsels' addresses and the Summing-Up made it clear that the issue for the jury was whether the appellant's conduct in signing the cheques was dishonest.

69It was permissible for the Crown to rely upon the subsequently produced documents to cast light upon the appellant's state of mind at the time of signing the cheques. The fact that the experienced counsel appearing for the appellant did not seek any direction to ensure that there was no misunderstanding as to the way in which those documents could be used confirms that it was obvious that the jury had to consider the appellant's state of mind at the time of the relevant payments. As I cannot see any basis for granting leave to raise the point, r 4 of Criminal Appeal Rules precludes the appellant from relying upon this ground.

70In the course of his submissions on this ground, the appellant submitted that his evidence indicated a lack of connection on his part with the 2005 prospectus. However, he had signed a declaration forming part of the relevant financial report confirming the accuracy of its contents (which included Note 20 referred to in [16] and [26] above). He accepted in evidence that he had done this (Transcript 11/2/11, p 19) and did not at any point suggest that he had been unaware of the report's reference to the impugned payments. Moreover, contrary to the appellant's submission on appeal, the jury was entitled to regard his acceptance in evidence of the inaccuracy of the descriptions in the Note as reflective of his state of mind at the time of the subject payments.

GROUND 6: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE HAS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE CROWN'S SUBMISSION AS TO THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE FINCORP COMPANIES

71The appellant submitted that there was no factual basis for the Crown's submission that, contrary to the appellant's evidence, there were no profits in the Group. 

72The principal references in the appellant's evidence to profits were in the passages referred to in [12], [14], [19], [23] and [25] above and in the following evidence:

""The properties had gone up significantly in value and, if we developed the properties, there was even further profits to be made. So there was substantial profits"" (Transcript 11/2/11, p 14).

73In final address the Crown submitted that ""there were no real profits in the Group"" and the figure by which the value of the subject properties was alleged to have appreciated ""was entirely a paper figure which didn't, in any way, represent a profit"" (Transcript 14/2/11, p 249).

74The appellant submitted on appeal:

""The Crown did not lead any evidence as to whether the individual companies themselves were not profitable and therefore could not pay a dividend. Nor was evidence led to refute the [appellant's] evidence as to the financial position of the companies. Indeed there was evidence that supported the [appellant's] evidence of the increased value of the properties"" (Written Submissions [124]).

75In my view, this ground of appeal has no substance. The Crown's submissions as to the absence of profit were merely a response to the appellant's references to profits in his reasons for regarding the payments as legitimate. Those references were to profits arising out of a perceived increase in the value of the properties owned by the Group. There was no suggestion that any individual company in the Group, or the Group as a whole, had earned relevant profits arising other than from an increase in the value of the properties. In these circumstances, the Crown needed to do no more than contradict the suggestion that there were distributable profits arising out of increases in property values. For the reasons that I have given in [51] to [60] above, it did so.

76This ground of appeal, as with many of the others, relates to a point not taken at the trial. No request was made at the trial for a direction that the Crown's submission misstated the evidence as to the financial position of the Fincorp Group companies. As I discern no reason why leave should be given to raise this point for the first time on appeal, the appellant is precluded by r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules from doing so.

GROUND 7: THE VERDICTS CANNOT BE SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE AS THE APPELLANT'S CONDUCT WAS NOT DISHONEST WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE CORPORATIONS ACT

77The appellant submitted that his conduct could not have been dishonest unless it was at least ""improper"" and that the High Court's decision in Angas Law Services indicated that this was not the case.

78In Angas Law Services the shareholders and directors of the company were alleged to have improperly used their positions in breach of s 229(4) of the Companies (South Australia) Code by causing the company to grant a mortgage over company property to secure a debt owed to the mortgagee by one of the directors. Gleeson CJ and Heydon J (with whom Kirby J agreed) concluded that the South Australian Full Court's finding of no impropriety had not been in error. Their Honours said also:

""The unanimous informed consent of the shareholders of ALS, the solvency of ALS and Mr Carabelas, and the absence of any adverse effect on the interests of third parties, were facts relevant to the propriety of the mortgage transaction"" (at [29]).

79In the Full Court, Doyle CJ (with whom Prior and Vanstone JJ agreed) had relied upon these factors in concluding that there had been no impropriety, but had specifically noted that there was no allegation that the subject transaction was dishonest or fraudulent and that the transaction had not amounted to misappropriation contrary to the interests of any other person (Angas Law Services at [25]). 

80In the High Court, Gummow and Hayne JJ said that the liquidator's broad submission that the ""corporators necessarily acted improperly if they so acted as to bring about the appropriation of the company's assets as their own"" insufficiently allowed for the significance of the commercial context in each individual case and assumed an inflexible standard of conduct (at [66] - [67]). Their Honours said that the ""best interests of the company will depend on various factors including solvency"" (at [67]) and cited with approval statements of Street CJ in Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (in liq) (1986) 4 NSWLR 722 at 730, including that in ""a solvent company the proprietary interests of the shareholders entitle them as a general body to be regarded as the company when questions of the duty of directors arise"". Their Honours said that nothing in Macleod v The Queen [2003] HCA 24; 214 CLR 230 suggested the contrary and concluded that the combination of the two factors of solvency and shareholder authorisation ""indicates that the standards of propriety expected of the directors [were] not breached"" (at [69]).

81In Macleod, a director who was the sole beneficial shareholder of the company was charged with fraudulently taking or applying property of the company ""for his own use or benefit, or any use or purpose other than the use or purpose of such body corporate or company"". The Court held that the sole shareholder's consent to his own conduct was not the consent of the company so as to negate the allegation of fraud. As said by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, the ""self-interested 'consent' of the shareholder, given in furtherance of a crime committed against the company, cannot be said to represent the consent of the company"" (at [30]). In this context, the word ""fraudulently"" was interchangeable with ""dishonestly"" (at [34]).

82Even assuming that the appellant in the present case was in a position equivalent to that of a sole beneficial shareholder, his consent to the subject payments, implicit in his involvement in them, did not prevent his conduct from being characterised as dishonest. In my view this conclusion is dictated by the decision in Macleod, which is directly in point. Each of the members of the Court in Angas Law Services accepted the continuing authority of Macleod. 

83The decision in Angas Law Services is, in my view, distinguishable. As noted earlier, Doyle CJ's Full Court judgment, in which Gleeson CJ and Heydon and Kirby did not find error, specifically noted that the transaction in issue in that case was not alleged to have been dishonest or fraudulent. Likewise Gummow and Hayne JJ appeared to distinguish Macleod upon the basis that in that case a crime (constituted by the allegedly fraudulent transaction) was asserted to have been committed against the company (see [68]). In the present case the charges against the appellant were founded upon dishonesty, as is apparent from the form of the charges upon which the appellant was convicted (see [1] above).

84In dealing thus far with the appellant's submissions on this ground, I have assumed that he was effectively the beneficial owner of the shares in the holding companies of the Fincorp Group. However it is by no means clear that this was the case. As noted earlier (see [5] above), the owner of the shares in the ultimate holding company was a trustee controlled by the appellant. The description in the relevant trust deed of the potential beneficiaries of the trust was broad enough to include the appellant (see Recital A to the trust deed, although members of the appellant's family, other than the appellant, were identified as the beneficiaries of the trust in the diagram attached to the agreed Statement of Facts - see [5] above). However the appellant's status as ""controller"" and potential beneficiary under the trust deed would not necessarily, even so far as the Trust was concerned, have entitled him to apply the funds of companies in which the Trust held shares for his own benefit. As this point does not appear to have been raised at the trial and was not fully examined on appeal, it is not appropriate to comment further, other than to note that, in terms of ownership of shares in the relevant company, the appellant does not appear to have been in the position of the shareholders in Angas Law Services.

GROUND 8: THE VERDICTS ARE UNREASONABLE AND/OR NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE

85The appellant submitted that in light of the following alleged circumstances, the evidence did not establish that his conduct was dishonest:

(1) The Group was profitable and in no danger of insolvency.

(2) The transactions had the approval of the effective sole shareholder and were disclosed to and approved by the Chief Financial Officer (Mr Quigley).

(3) The transactions did not disadvantage any third party.

(4) The appellant sought and received advice from Mr Bunter, the company auditor, as to the appropriateness of the payments and as to how they were to be appropriately recorded.

(5) The appellant was not involved in preparing any of the post-transactional documents.

(6) The purpose for which the payments were made was not dishonest. The appellant referred in this connection to his counsel's submission in final address at the trial that the purpose of the $1.98 M payment was to distribute profit in accordance with a previous arrangement with the recipients.

86Even if these submissions were factually accurate, they would not in my view answer the Crown's case that, taking into account all of the circumstances established by the evidence, the appellant's conduct in giving effect to the transactions was dishonest because the payments were purportedly made as remuneration for services rendered in relation to the Epping Road and Doreen properties when the appellant knew that the recipients had not done work justifying those payments. 

87It was not an answer to the Crown's case for the appellant to assert that it was fair that he receive such payments because he had been working for two years to set up and establish the Fincorp Group allegedly without adequate remuneration. An employee cannot justify his or her theft of the employer's money by asserting, or establishing, that the employee is underpaid or even that, if the employee had sought it, he or she could have obtained an increase in salary exceeding the amount stolen. The thrust of part of the justification for the payments given by the appellant was not dissimilar.

88In the circumstances of the Fincorp Group, the manner in which payments of the Group's funds to related parties were recorded in its books of account was undoubtedly important. Indeed the appellant's concern to have Mr Bunter approve the description of the payments from an accounting perspective illustrates that. 

89The Fincorp Group's business was to raise money from the public for the purpose of it being on-lent and used for property development. According to the appellant's evidence, the Group had, by the end of 2003, raised some $56 M from the public. It had issued a prospectus dated 1 November 2002, expiring on 29 October 2003, and another dated 14 October 2003, expiring on 12 November 2004. It subsequently issued a further prospectus on 7 December 2004, expiring on 6 January 2006. 

90Disclosure of related party transactions was required in the financial accounts contained in those prospectuses. The description given in the 2005 prospectus of the subject payments as ""spotter's fees"" suggested no impropriety in the payments, implying that they had been made as remuneration for work performed in relation to specific property acquisitions by the Group. An accurate description of the $1.98 M payment, for example, would have been that it was a distribution to the appellant and various members of his family of unrealised capital profits thought by the appellant to have accrued but not the subject of any formal valuations or accounting entries. Such a description would have raised immediate concerns in the minds of potential investors as to the propriety of the payment and as to the manner in which the business of the Group was being conducted.

91The evidence gave rise to a compelling inference that the appellant intended the payments to be falsely described in the accounting records of the Group. Such intended false characterisation of the payments constituted the gravamen of the charges against the appellant (see [1] above). The fact that a number of the documents relied upon by the Crown were created after the payments were made does not assist the appellant. The appellant's evidence established his concurrence to the treatment of the $750,000 (plus GST) payment as ""a management fee from one of the property companies"" (see [13] above). The email of 20 October 2003, seen by the appellant, was to the same effect in relation to the payment of $1.98 M, as it referred to the prospective payment of ""spotter's fees"" (see [23] above). Documents which were, or may have been, prepared subsequent to the payments and which described the payments in the same fashion, were capable of being used by the jury as additional evidence of the appellant's intentions at the time of the payments.

92The appellant accepted in cross-examination that the description in the 2005 prospectus of the payments as ""spotter's fees"" was incorrect (see [16], [26] - [27] above) and he did not in his evidence at the trial or in his submissions on the appeal assert that they were accurate. 

93In these circumstances the evidence should be regarded as clearly establishing that the appellant authorised the payments to be made on a purported basis that was false.

94For the reasons given earlier, the alleged profitability and solvency of the Group, and the alleged approval of its sole shareholder, did not indicate that the appellant did not act dishonestly in authorising the subject payments (see [48] - [60], [71] - [76], [82] - [84] above). Further, Mr Quigley's approval of the transactions is of no assistance to the appellant as Mr Quigley's view of the propriety of the payments was not one upon which the appellant was entitled to rely, nor did the appellant give evidence that he did rely upon Mr Quigley's views. 

95The appellant's alleged reliance upon Mr Bunter's advice was a central limb of his response to the Crown's case. However, there was nothing in Mr Bunter's evidence to suggest that Mr Bunter did more than sanction payments of remuneration to individuals who had done work in relation to particular properties that justified the payment of such remuneration. Bearing in mind the passage of years, the understandable fact that Mr Bunter's recollection of dates and details of conversations was fallible did not require his evidence on this issue to be rejected. Although not expressly put, the effect of the appellant's submissions is that Mr Bunter advised Mr Quigley and, through him, the appellant, that it was appropriate for the Group to make payments on a knowingly false basis. The appellant did not identify any benefit that Mr Bunter hoped to gain by giving such plainly unethical and dishonest advice and did not expressly put to him in cross-examination that he had done so.

96The email of 20 October 2003 does not suggest that Mr Bunter gave any such advice. It refers to the ""withdrawing [of] up to $2 mil in spotters fees"" (see [23] above) and does not suggest that those fees had not been earned by the proposed recipients. 

97The jury had the advantage, which this Court does not, of seeing and hearing the witnesses, including Mr Bunter and the appellant, give their evidence. The jury's verdicts suggest that it accepted the evidence of Mr Bunter. Based on my view of the transcript of the oral evidence and of the documents admitted at the trial, my view is that this conclusion was entirely rational and well-founded.

98For these reasons I do not consider that Mr Bunter's advice, or any of the other matters relied upon by the appellant in relation to this ground of appeal (see [85] above), give cause for doubt about the soundness of the finding of dishonesty on the part of the appellant implicit in the jury's verdicts. 

99Bearing in mind my reasons for rejecting the appellant's earlier grounds of appeal and the appellant's specific submissions on this ground of appeal, as well as my review of the evidence at the trial, my view is that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences of which he was convicted. I am satisfied to the same standard that the appellant was guilty of those offences (see SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14] and [20]).

ORDERS

100For the reasons I have given, the appeal should be dismissed.

2708173,TVH Australasia Pty Ltd v Chaseling [2012] NSWCA 149,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The respondent, who was employed by the appellant, was injured on 29 June 2006 when a box fell from a forklift onto his leg while he was assisting in the unloading of a shipping container. There was evidence that the boxes, which rested on pallets, often shifted and became unstable while the containers were in transit. There was also evidence that the tines of the forklift used to lift the pallets had to be spread to counter the flexibility of the pallets. The driver of the forklift had not spread the tines and had not been told by the appellant of the risk that materialised.

The respondent brought proceedings in negligence against the appellant. At the time of the accident, the definition of ""injury"" in the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW), s 3, stated:

""injury:

(a) means personal or bodily injury caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle, if, and only if, the injury is a result of and is caused during:

(i) the driving of the vehicle ...""

Levy DCJ gave judgment for the respondent in the sum of $712,275. He found that the injury fell within the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act. He further found that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the respondent.

The appellant appealed to this Court, challenging the finding that the injury fell within the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, and challenging the primary judge's findings of negligence and causation.

The issues for determination on appeal were:

(i) whether the appellant was liable in negligence for the respondent's injury, and
(ii) whether the respondent's injury fell within the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.

The Court held (per Basten JA, Bathurst CJ and Whealy JA agreeing), dismissing the appeal:

In relation to (i)

1. There was evidence supporting the conclusion that the appellant was in fact aware of the risks associated with unloading the containers. The evidence supported a finding of negligence on a basis which was not pleaded with any particularity and which differed from that upheld by the trial judge. The evidence itself was not in dispute and the findings which may fairly be based upon it can hardly be challenged by the appellant, given that the evidence was adduced from its witness: [16]-[17]

2. The evidence supports the conclusion that the appellant knew, or at least should reasonably have been aware of the problem and should have notified the forklift driver accordingly. It should also have warned the plaintiff as to the known risk: [18]

In relation to (ii)

3. A distinction is to be drawn between a defect in a motor vehicle which directly causes injury and a defect which leads to the adoption of an alternative negligently devised scheme of work, not involving the defective mechanism: [24]

Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v GSF Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26; 221 CLR 568; Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd v CSR Ltd [2001] NSWCA 261; 52 NSWLR 193; Izzard v Dunbier Marine Products (NSW) Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 132 referred to.

4. It does not follow that, because one can characterize a fault in terms which appear to be detached from and antecedent to the actual use or operation of the vehicle, the definition of ""injury"" is not engaged: [26]

5. An experienced forklift driver with knowledge of the risk which in fact materialised would have spread the tines and taken steps to secure the load. The negligence of the appellant was not in respect of a system of work ancillary to the use of and operation of forklift: it related directly to the manner in which the forklift was to be used and operated. It failed to advise the driver of the risk and how to avoid it materialising. The fact that the remedy may have lain at an earlier point in time did not mean that the proximate cause of the accident was not to be located in the manner of operating the vehicle: [30]

			Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Basten JA.

2BASTEN JA: From May 2004 the respondent, Mr Chaseling, had been employed by the appellant as a spare parts interpreter, working at the appellant's warehouse at Wetherill Park. On 29 June 2006 he suffered an injury when a box weighing 219kgs fell off a forklift onto his leg. At the time, the forklift was involved in unloading a container and was reversing down a ramp. Mr Chaseling was walking beside it.

3Mr Chaseling (""the plaintiff"") brought proceedings in negligence against his employer. Levy DCJ upheld a claim in negligence against the appellant, giving judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $712,275. He found that the injury fell within the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW). He further found that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.

4On 14 July 2011 the appellant filed a notice of appeal which challenged the finding that the injury fell within the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act and the finding that there had been no contributory negligence. By an amended notice of appeal filed on 11 October 2011, the appellant maintained the grounds relating to the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, but abandoned the challenge with respect to contributory negligence. A third area of challenge was raised, namely four grounds relating to the findings of negligence and causation. No objection was taken to the raising of these additional grounds out of time.

Factual background
5The appellant imported and sold spare parts for forklift vehicles from an associated company in Belgium. The imports were shipped in containers. On the date of the accident, 29 June 2006, the plaintiff was assisting another employee to unload parts contained in boxes on pallets from a container.

6The unloading procedure involved opening one end of the container, driving a forklift up a small ramp and into the container, manoeuvring the tines on the forklift under a pallet, lifting the pallet and reversing the forklift back out of the container and down the ramp.

7The driver on that afternoon was a Mr Linley Barnes. The plaintiff generally worked in the office. On the day in question, the operations manager asked him to help Mr Barnes unload the container. He had not assisted with the unloading before and had not driven a forklift. He was told that his part was to direct the forklift driver to guide the tines into the pallet: Tcpt, 21/02/11, pp 10-12. According to his observation of the length of the tines, he believed that there was a metal extension known as a ""slipper"" fixed to the tines. Once the tines were in place under the pallet, the driver lifted the pallet, which had two cardboard boxes on it, one on top of the other. When the pallet was on the ground, the bottom box was approximately chest high to the plaintiff: Tcpt, pp 22-23. As the forklift backed out of the container and down the ramp, with the plaintiff walking beside it, the top box, weighing 219kgs, fell off on the plaintiff's side, crushing his leg. The fall was caused either by the contents of the top box being heavier than those underneath and crushing the lower box, the contents of the top box not being uniformly distributed, or by a combination of both factors. The lower box was smaller and lighter, weighing approximately 70kgs.

Finding of negligence
8After considering the circumstances in which the accident occurred, the trial judge described what happened in the following terms at [17]:

""In the incident in question, after the plaintiff had guided the tips of the extended forklift tynes into position for Mr Barnes, so that the load was engaged on the tips, Mr Barnes moved the forklift truck out of the container and [the plaintiff] stood on the ground on the right-hand side of the forklift, in a position about 2 feet away from the ramp. The forklift truck then reversed down the ramp with the load resting by force of gravity on the tips of its tynes rather than up against the apron guard adjacent to the mast of the forklift. The plaintiff stated that whilst this reversing manoeuvre was taking place, the load of cartons shifted on the tynes, and moved over to the right. In these events, the bottom carton collapsed, leading to the cartons toppling towards the plaintiff. In this way, both cartons fell off the tynes. In this way, the boxes fell upon him without prior warning, and crushed him.""

9Although this description was criticised, in substance it reflected the evidence. The appellant noted, correctly, that the plaintiff's description had an element of reconstruction, rather than observation: Tcpt, 21/02/11, pp 62-63. It also challenged the finding that the bottom carton collapsed before the top (heavier) carton shifted and toppled off the forklift. However, whether the toppling was caused by the movement of the heavier carton or the collapse of the lower smaller carton was unclear. In the event, neither of these points was significant.

10When considering the issue of negligence, the trial judge asked whether the driver of the forklift was negligent. He held there were breaches of the duty of care owed by the appellant, some of which were direct negligence and some of which depended on vicarious liability based on the negligence of the driver. The judge identified seven breaches at [69]. The appellant submitted that some of the breaches were not pleaded, some were not supported by the evidence and some did not appear to have been relied on in the ultimate finding of negligence. It is convenient to restrict the inquiry to those matters which appear to have been relied on as causally linked with the injury. The judge made the following findings in that regard:

""71 From a causative perspective, of these confluent causes of the incident, the one that stands out as the pivotal causative event is the act of commencement and continuation of driving of the forklift in reverse, down a ramp at an angle to the ground, with its unsecured top heavy load perched towards the end of its tynes rather than at the more stable carrying position adjacent to the apron at the mast end of the tynes.

72 In my view, on a commonsense analysis, that action altered the inertial or gravitational force of the load, thus causing it to overbalance, collapse and fall onto the plaintiff. In my view, this was a fundamentally unsafe manoeuvre. The resultant injury to the plaintiff need not have occurred if commonsense was applied to beforehand secure the load, place it into a more stable position near the mast, to not drive the forklift until it was so secured, and even then, warn the plaintiff to stand clear.""

11In broad terms, these findings appear to reflect the following conclusion set out at [69]:

""Fourthly, [t]he manoeuvre carried out by Mr Barnes in reversing the forklift down the ramp, without first ensuring that the load was checked as being stable and secure on the tynes against the apron of the mast, was an inherently risk-laden exercise that exposed the plaintiff to foreseeable injury.... Sixthly, the plaintiff was not advised by his supervisor, or by some other responsible employee, that he should stand clear during the unloading manoeuvre.""

12Having made the findings set out above, the trial judge then referred to the expert opinions of a safety engineer and ergonomist: at [75]. However, that evidence does not seem to have supplied further grounds for the conclusion as to liability, rather than support for the causative factors identified above. That inference appears from the subsequent findings in relation to the issue next addressed by his Honour, namely whether the injury occurred during the use or operation of a motor vehicle, for the purposes of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act. In addressing that issue he stated at [81]:

""I have already stated my finding that the cause for the load falling onto the plaintiff from the tynes of the forklift was that the load had not been secured or stabilised before the forklift was put in reverse motion and driven. In my view, the decision to drive the forklift in those circumstances, and to continue to drive it down the ramp, necessarily involved fault on the part of the driver .... Given that the owner of the forklift was the employer of the driver, this necessarily means that the owner was vicariously liable for the driver's fault.""

13The appellant's challenge to the finding of negligence was based on the proposition that, although it was open to the judge to find that the load was unstable and insecure, based on the events which occurred when the load toppled off the forklift, there was nothing known to the appellant, its driver or the plaintiff prior to the accident, as a result of which they were aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, of the risks involved. Accordingly, there had been no failure to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff.

14With one qualification, the reasons given by the trial judge provided no persuasive answer to that criticism. The qualification derives from the reports of Mr David Dubos, the safety engineer, and Mr Rick Rech, an occupational health and safety officer with the CFMEU who claimed ""many years of training and assessing forklift operators as a WorkCover Inspector in the safe use of forklifts"". Mr Rech stated that ""[t]he driver should have been aware of the dangers associated with engaging and lifting unstable loads and loads which are multi stacked"". Whether the load was known to be ""unstable"" before it collapsed was in dispute. However, Mr Dubos made the following statement in his report, admitted without objection (Tcpt, p 5):

""I understand that the pallet was made from plastic and was not as strong as plastic pallets being used generally in Australia. It has been stated that TVH Australasia was constantly having problems with the pallets breaking and cracking. It is apparent they were designed for storing products and not for transporting products. When loaded with heavy boxes, and the pallet was lifted using forklift truck, the pallet would bow and make the load unstable. All Australian branches of TVH had complained to TVH management generally about the pallets up to the time of the Plaintiff's accident, but no action was taken by TVH.""

15Although the last opinion was clearly hearsay, it found some support elsewhere in the evidence. The appellant called Mr Louis, who was the plaintiff's immediate superior at the time of the accident. Mr Louis held a forklift driver's licence. Counsel for the appellant led from him the evidence that Mr Barnes did not have a licence at the time of the accident: Tcpt, 22/02/11, p 76 (30). Of far greater importance was his evidence as to the experience of prior shipments of forklift parts, which the appellant imported from Belgium. The following evidence was given at Tcpt, pp 77-80:

""Q. Did you have personal experience before this incident with one of those similar containers of the goods within them moving?
A. Yes.

...
They just sat on pallets and with - coming across on the ships, the movement of the container, and they would just, like, integrate with each other. They'd just slide around on the pallets.

...

Q. You've mentioned pallets now, Mr Louis. Can you describe ... the pallets you're talking about?

...
A. They were a plastic structure.

...

Q. Did these plastic pallets have a wooden bottom like those CHEP pallets?
A. No.

Q. ... Was there some feature of the plastic pallets before this incident occurred that gave you cause for concern?
A. They break and we have seen them come across broken in the containers.

Q. Did they have any other tendency other than breaking?
A. Flexibility when you lift them.

...
Q. Did you notice that phenomenon about these pallets?
A. Yes, when I picked it up, it flexed. I put it back down and spread my tines further apart.

...
Q. Let me ask you about the load, Mr Louis. In the past when you dealt with these arrivals from Belgium, were the boxes secured together?

...
A. No.

Q. Were the boxes covered in any sort of material?
A. There may have been a plastic wrap, but it was not shrink wrap. [They] might have some form of wrapping but nine times out of ten it was broken due to the load moving.

...
Q. Did you have cause to complain to your employers about these pallets that you've told us about?
A. Several occasions.

Q. What was the nature of your complaint?
A. Cracking in transit, breaking, causing the parcel to fall off the loads and just a mess in the container when we get there.

Q. What was done about it?
A. Nothing.""

16This material constituted ample evidence, from a witness called by counsel for the appellant, supporting the conclusion that the appellant was in fact aware of the risks associated with unloading the containers. It is not in dispute that Mr Barnes did not have the experience as a forklift driver that Mr Louis had. Nor is it in dispute that the plaintiff was given no instruction as to the known risks of an activity in which it appears he had not participated in the past.

17The evidence supported a finding of negligence on a basis which was not pleaded with any particularity and which differed from that upheld by the trial judge. The evidence itself was not in dispute and the findings which may fairly be based upon it can hardly be challenged by the appellant, given that the evidence was adduced from its witness. 

18No doubt because the issue as to the liability of the appellant in negligence only squarely arose in the course of argument in this Court, no objection was taken to the reliance by the plaintiff on the evidence of Mr Louis. Nor was any objection taken to the absence of a notice of contention in support of an appropriate finding. Rather, the appellant contended that Mr Louis' evidence related to problems which had arisen on prior occasions and was therefore irrelevant in the absence of any indication that a similar problem existed with respect to the container being unloaded at the time of the accident: CA Tcpt, 09/03/12, p 46 (35)-(45) and p 48 (45)-(48). However, the evidence set out above supports the conclusion that the appellant knew, or at least should reasonably have been aware of the problem and should have notified an inexperienced forklift driver as to what steps to take to avoid an accident arising while unloading possibly unstable packages which may have shifted in the container during the long sea voyage. It should have warned the plaintiff in similar terms as to the known risk.

19It may seem odd that such evidence was led by the appellant. However, the appellant took at least two strategic decisions in running the case. First, although there was an argument as to contributory negligence at trial, that was abandoned on appeal. An assertion of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff ran the risk of inconsistency with the proposition that there was no reason for the forklift driver (or the plaintiff) to anticipate any danger in respect of the circumstances in which the accident arose.

20The second strategic decision was to focus on the immediate or predominant cause of the accident. If that cause were not the use or operation of the forklift, but some prior failure in establishing a safe system of work, the appellant would avoid liability under the Motor Accidents Compensation Act. Because the plaintiff had not brought proceedings for work injury damages, he could not recover for the absence of a safe system of work. To explain the basis for this position it is necessary to turn to the second major limb in the appellant's case.

Whether injury caused by a motor accident
21Ground 1 in the notice of appeal asserted that the trial judge erred in finding that the plaintiff had suffered an ""injury"" within the meaning of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act. Ground 2 asserted that the judge had erred in failing to find that the proceedings were a claim for ""work injury damages"" within the meaning of the Workers Compensation Acts. The theory underlying this limb of the appeal was based upon that dichotomy.

22At the date of the accident, the Motor Accidents Compensation Act contained the following definition of ""injury"" in s 3:

""3 Definitions

In this Act:

...
injury:

(a) means personal or bodily injury caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle if, and only if, the injury is a result of and is caused during:

(i) the driving of the vehicle ....""

23By contrast, the term ""injury"" as defined in the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) means ""personal injury arising out of or in the course of employment"": s 4(a). The term ""work injury damages"" is defined in the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 (NSW), s 250(1) to mean damages recoverable from an employer in respect of an injury to a worker caused by the negligence of the employer.

24It is clear that there is no bright line to be drawn between the two legislative schemes. There will self-evidently be situations where a worker is injured in a motor accident in the course of his or her employment, where the fault lies with the employer, or a person for whom the employer is vicariously liable. Nevertheless, amendments to the predecessor of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act which commenced in 1995, were intended to limit the scope of that legislation in respect of work injuries. In particular, the amendments were designed to limit the extent to which loading and unloading operations would qualify as a motor accident. Thus, a distinction was thereafter to be drawn between a defect in a motor vehicle which directly causes injury and a defect which leads to the adoption of an alternative negligently devised scheme of work, not involving the defective mechanism: see Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v GSF Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26; 221 CLR 568; Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd v CSR Ltd [2001] NSWCA 261; 52 NSWLR 193, recently discussed in Izzard v Dunbier Marine Products (NSW) Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 132 at [18]-[25] (in my judgment) and [126]-[129] (Macfarlan JA, Barrett JA agreeing). (Further amendments to the definition commenced shortly after the accident, on 1 October 2006, but are not applicable in this case: Schedule 5, cl 19.) 

25However, this was not a case involving negligent loading or unloading, but rather the driving of a forklift with an unsafe load. It did not engage the questions of causality raised by the second part of the definition. There was no doubt that the injury to the plaintiff was ""a result of and [was] caused during ... the driving of the vehicle"". Nevertheless, the appellant argued that, assuming there was fault on its part as owner of the vehicle, the fault was not ""in the use or operation of the vehicle"", but involved a failure, antecedent to the use or operation of the vehicle, to devise a safe system for that use or operation. Thus, if the accident were caused by the failure of the employer to give proper instruction to either Mr Barnes or the plaintiff with respect to the unloading operation and the risks involved, that was a fault which arose prior to any use or operation of the forklift.

26As explained in the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Allianz, in relation to the second part of the definition, ""the emphatic and intensive phrase 'if, and only if' directs attention to notions of predominance and immediacy rather than to more removed circumstances"": at [102]. Nevertheless, there is no bright line to be drawn between a cause which is predominant and immediate, rather than one which is ""more removed"". Similarly, it does not follow that, because one can characterize a fault in terms which appear to be detached from and antecedent to the actual use or operation of the vehicle, the definition is not engaged. For example, where an employer allows a heavy vehicle to be used in the course of the business and injury is caused by the driver losing control of the vehicle, it is appropriate to characterise the fault of the owner as permitting the use of the vehicle by a driver without proper training and thus a fault ""in the use or operation of the vehicle"". This conclusion is not undermined because the fault can also be characterized as the failure to provide training, which appears to be removed from the use or operation of the vehicle.

27Where a negligently loaded vehicle loses part of its load on a highway, causing injury to the occupants of a following vehicle, the injury will fall within the scope of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, not because the manner of driving was negligent, but because the negligent loading operation fell within the phrase ""fault ... in the use or operation of the vehicle"".

28In Zurich Australian, the plaintiff was injured when lifting a ramp which was part of a trailer attached to a truck, without mechanical aids. Spigelman CJ addressed the submission as to why the injury fell outside the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, at [29]:

""The first submission was, essentially, one of characterisation. The Appellant submitted that the injury was not caused ""in the use and operation of"" the trailer. The injury was caused by an unsafe system of work or in the design of the trailer. Nothing in the language used, or the scope, purpose or operation of the Act, suggests that a dual characterisation of 'fault' is impermissible. The definition applies so long as the fault may be characterised in the way set out within it. It matters not that some other characterisation may also be appropriate.""

29The High Court did not overrule Zurich Australian in Allianz, but in Nominal Defendant v GLG Australia Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 11; 228 CLR 529 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ noted that the Court had not, in Allianz, adopted the characterisation of ""fault"" used by Spigelman CJ in Zurich Australia: GLG Australia at [28]. It did however accept that the question was ""one of characterisation"": at [31]. 

30The appellant submitted in the present case that there was nothing negligent in the manner in which Mr Barnes operated the forklift. However, that was not so. An experienced forklift driver with knowledge of the risk which in fact materialised would, according to Mr Louis, have spread the tines and perhaps taken other steps to secure the load. The negligence of the appellant was not in respect of a system of work ancillary to the use and operation of the forklift: it related directly to the manner in which the forklift was to be used and operated. It failed to inform the driver of the risk and how to avoid it materialising. The fact that the remedy may have lain at an earlier point in time did not mean that the proximate cause of the accident was not to be located in the manner of operating the vehicle.

31The appellant drew support from the judgment of the High Court in GLG Australia, which it described as ""not far removed factually from the present case"". On another view, the factual distinction between this case and GLG Australia leads to a different conclusion. The similarities involved the use of a forklift to pick up pallets and then reverse down a ramp in the course of unloading a container. The first point of distinction was that in GLG Australia the contents of the container were in boxes which were moved by workers onto a pallet at the front of the container. Secondly, the injury was not caused by a box falling off the forklift; it was caused by the vibrations created by the forklift dislodging a box from a stack within the container, which then fell on a worker. The trial judge in GLG Australia (Delaney DCJ) held, correctly in the judgment of the High Court, that the injury was not the result of a motor accident.

32In adopting that approach the majority identified the correct characterisation in the following passages:

""27 It is true that the occupier was at fault. The fault, however, lay not in the use or operation of the forklift truck, namely, the driving of it. The occupier itself was not driving, nor was the driver it employed driving in a negligent way. The occupier's fault lay in designing and implementing a system of work that involved driving the vehicle in the manner in which it was driven, rather than devising and providing a reasonably safe system of unloading the containers which would not cause vibrations likely to destabilise the boxes being unloaded.

...

29 The flaw in the occupier's contention that the words before 'if, and only if' are to be broadly construed ... is that the contention gives no weight to the word 'in' in the expression 'in the use or operation of the vehicle'. As counsel for the occupier accepted, 'in the use' here means with respect to, as a consequence of, or by reason of the use of the forklift truck in the circumstances. That in turn points to the need to examine fault in the actual use or operation of the forklift truck at the particular time and place of the injury, and excludes an inquiry that goes more widely to instances of fault in the planning which led to its deployment and which may have taken place at points of time and place remote from those of the injury.""

33It may be that there is a level of uncertainty in adopting variations for the word ""in"", as suggested at [29]; for example, the phrase ""with respect to"" could have a potentially wider operation than ""in"". Further, the phrases ""as a consequence of"" and ""by reason of"" appear to have a causal element, although the fault cannot be caused by the use of the vehicle. However, the constrictive intention is clear. Thus, while the driving of the vehicle caused the injury in GLG Australia (at [33]), there was ""no fault on the part of the owner or the driver of the forklift truck in its use or operation"": at [31]. 

34For reasons already explained, in the present case the fault lay in the manner of operating the forklift, namely the driving of a forklift with an unsafe load. That was a fault ""in the use or operation of"" the forklift. This challenge to the decision of the trial judge must be rejected.

Conclusion
35The appellant having failed on both the major limbs of its appeal, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

36WHEALY JA: I agree with Basten JA.

		22 May 2012",2012-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2708185,R v Aliwijaya [2012] NSWSC 503,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  Mohamed Aliwijaya stands charged with the murder of Robson Pham on 24 April 2010.  The accused elected for trial by judge alone and was tried by me on 14 May 2012.  This judgment records my verdict in the trial, together with my reasons for reaching the verdict.
Fitness to be tried
2Before the trial commenced, I determined that the accused was, on the balance of probabilities, fit to be tried for the offence.  It was necessary to consider that question because he had previously been found unfit (on 8 August 2011): see R v Mohamed Iqbal Aliwijaya [2011] NSWSC 924 per Hidden J (it appears he has also been found unfit to be tried for a separate offence that is not before this Court).  As a result of that finding, the accused was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal in accordance with s 14 (a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
3Section 15 of the Act creates a statutory presumption that a person who has been found unfit continues to be unfit to be tried for the offence until the contrary is, on the balance of probabilities, determined to be the case.
4On 13 December 2011, after reviewing the case, the Tribunal gave notice to the Court in accordance with s 47(5) of the Act of its opinion that the accused had become fit to be tried.  Section 29 of the Act mandates a further inquiry by the Court as to the person's fitness in that circumstance.  
5The question of fitness is to be determined by the judge alone:  see s 11(1) of the Act.  The determination must include the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact on which the judge relied: s 11(2) of the Act.
6The principles for determining whether a person is fit to be tried are stated in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48 per Smith J.   Those principles have since been approved by the High Court in Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 8 and Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 246.6.  In Presser, Smith J said:
[An accused] needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with.  He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge.  He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with.  He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in a court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities.  He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge.  Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is.  He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.
7The Crown submitted that the Court should be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused was fit, as at the time of his trial, to be tried for the offence.  Mr Smith, who appeared for the accused, joined in that submission.
8The evidence relied upon by the Crown on the issue of fitness was the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal to which I have already referred together with a report dated 20 January 2012 obtained by the Crown from Professor David Greenberg, forensic psychiatrist, and a report dated 23 April 2012 obtained on behalf of the accused from Dr Richard Furst, consultant forensic psychiatrist (collectively marked Exhibit C).  
9The determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal arose from the Tribunal's fourth review of the case of the accused.  In conducting that review, the Tribunal had the benefit of a detailed report from the accused's multidisciplinary treating team.  The Tribunal also heard oral evidence from the accused's legal representative, Ms Dalumpines (from the Mental Health Advocacy Service); Dr John Kasinathan, the accused's treating psychiatrist and Ms Lekahiyn, the accused's mother.  
10Dr Kasinathan assessed the accused to be fit to stand trial and fit to plead by reference to the Presser criteria.  In his oral evidence before the Tribunal, Dr Kasinathan explained the reason the treating team had reached that conclusion notwithstanding earlier unfitness findings by two courts.  Dr Kasinathan stated that his assessment had to be understood in the context of the fact that the accused is a young man with treatment resistant schizophrenia who was only commenced on the drug Clozapine within the last year.  
11Dr Kasinathan explained that Clozapine takes time to take effect and that earlier fitness assessments had been conducted at a time before the accused had responded to the drug.  It was Dr Kasinathan's opinion that the dose of Clozapine administered to the accused had resulted in a gradual but sustained improvement in his psychosis and that, whilst he is not cured, he is much improved from his earlier condition.
12The accused's solicitor, Ms Dalumpines, had also taken him through the Presser criteria and, having done so, concurred with Dr Kasinathan's report.  The accused's mother gave evidence that she had noted a great improvement in her son's condition since his admission as a forensic patient.
13Following the determination of the Tribunal that the accused was fit to be tried, the accused was re-assessed by Professor Greenberg and Dr Furst.  Professor Greenberg assessed the accused on 4 January 2012 by reference to the Presser criteria.  He concluded that the accused was fit to plead and stand trial, stating:
Mr Aliwijaya understands the charges he is currently facing.  Mr Aliwijaya understands the various pleads to the charge, including the plead of guilty, not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental illness.  He generally understands the nature of the proceedings, that it is an enquiry into the veracity of allegations against him.  I am of the view that he generally could understand the course of proceedings and the functions of the officers in Court.  He stated that the role of the Judge was to give judgment based on the evidence and pass sentence.  He stated that his lawyer's role was to defend him whilst the prosecutor prosecutes him.  He initially did not know how many members there were on the jury but after being reminded it was twelve and not ten, he retained this information.  He understood how the jury was selected and their role if he had a jury in Court.  In my opinion he had the capacity to exercise his right to challenge the jurors.  He understood that he was the accused and the role of the witnesses.
14Dr Furst was of the same opinion.  He stated:
He now has a better understanding of the charges he is facing in the legal options available to him.  He was able to make his version of the events known to myself and could probably do so in a trial setting if so required.  He understood the various roles of the judge, jury, his own legal representatives and the public prosecutor.  He understood what evidence was and had sufficient cognitive capacity to pay attention to what was said in court and understand court proceedings in the general sense.
15After considering that material, I asked counsel for the accused, Mr Smith, whether he had been able to communicate with the accused on the morning of the trial and comfortably obtain such instructions as he required.  He indicated without any equivocation that he had been able to do so.
16I accepted the uncontested opinions of the two psychiatrists, Professor Greenberg and Dr Furst, that the accused was fit to be tried.  I also had regard to the fact that there was consensus between them as to the availability of the defence of mental illness, which meant that the complexity of the trial would be substantially reduced.  Further, I took into account the fact that the estimated length of the trial was only one day:  cf Kesavarajah at 246.  In the circumstances, I was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused was fit to be tried.
Trial by judge alone
17On 13 April 2012, the accused elected to be tried by a judge alone.  The Director of Public Prosecutions recorded his consent to the election on 1 May 2012.  The election was made in a  prescribed form and filed before the date of the trial, as required by r 75.3H of the Supreme Court Rules 1970.  In the circumstances, an order for trial by judge alone was mandated under s 132(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  The order was made and entered on 14 May 2012.
Circumstances of the offence
18By agreement with counsel for the accused, the Crown case was presented in the form of a bundle of documents consisting of statements, photographs and reports (Exhibit B).  There was no contest as to any of the matters established by those documents.  On the strength of the material in Exhibit B, I make the following findings of fact.
19As at 22 April 2010, the accused was in custody on remand at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre in Silverwater, having been arrested several days earlier for a separate matter.  On that day, he was placed in a two-man cell with Robson Pham, the deceased.
20On the afternoon of 23 April 2010, the accused and the deceased were locked in their cell for the evening at about 3.25 pm.  The following morning at about 6.15 am, Correctional Services officers began their morning ""head count"" of inmates within that part of the gaol.  When they opened the door to the accused's cell, they saw the deceased lying on his back on the floor and the accused standing next to him.  An officer asked the accused ""is he alright?""  The accused replied ""I bashed him"", repeating that statement several times.  Ambulance officers were called but were unable to revive the deceased.
21The accused participated in an electronically recorded interview during which he made a series of admissions as to the offence.  He stated that, in the early hours of the morning when the deceased appeared to be asleep, he climbed on to the deceased's bed and commenced to ""stomp"" him with his feet.  The deceased awoke and attempted to defend himself, whereupon the accused put his arm around the deceased's neck and tried to choke him.  The two men fell to the floor, where the accused continued to choke the deceased.  The deceased attempted to crawl away from the accused and as he did so the accused kicked him a number of times. Eventually the deceased stopped moving. He did not regain consciousness and died in the early hours of the morning.  
22An autopsy revealed extensive haemorrhage in the soft tissues of neck with fractures of the hyoid bone and cricoid cartilage.  The cause of death was fatal pressure to the neck.
23In his record of interview, the accused made some admissions as to his intention at the time he committed those acts.  He said that, just as he was about to go to sleep, he saw the accused do ""a kissy face"".  He did not look directly at the deceased but saw his face out of the corner of his eye.  He stated (Q 67-68):
I lost it.  I jumped up on his bed and stomped on him and I kicked him in the groin or whatever ... and then I tried to choke him and, yeah, and he became unconscious and I just left him there.
24The accused was later asked what force he was using when he had his arm around the deceased's neck (Q 330).  He said:
Pretty hard, as hard as I could.  I was trying to choke him.
25He said that it was his intention to ""knock him out"" and ""make him unconscious"".
26The accused subsequently told both forensic psychiatrists that he had killed the deceased in response to instructions from aliens that he needed to sacrifice someone in order to go to paradise.  When pressed by Professor Greenberg as to the version of events given to police, he said that he had lied about the deceased blowing him a kiss because he didn't want the police to think he was crazy.  For the reasons explained further below, I am satisfied that the accused intended to kill the deceased in response to hallucinatory instructions from aliens.  I do not accept that the deceased blew a kiss or made faces to the accused as described to police in the ERISP.     
Principles of law applied
27The onus of proof lies on the Crown to establish the elements of the offence of murder beyond reasonable doubt.  The Crown must prove:
(a) that the deceased died as a result of injuries inflicted by the accused;
(b) that those injuries were inflicted by deliberate acts of the accused; and
(c) that at the time of those acts, the accused intended to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm on him.
28On the strength of my findings of fact set out above, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those elements.  Specifically, I am satisfied that the deceased died as a result of injuries inflicted on him when the accused choked him.  I am satisfied that that was a deliberate act.  I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to kill the deceased.
The defence of mental illness
29The principal issue to be determined in the trial is whether the accused has established the defence of mental illness.  The onus is on the accused to establish the defence on the balance of probabilities:  see Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500 at 512-513.
30The defence of mental illness is to be determined in accordance with the principles stated in R v M'Naghton (1843) 8 ER 718, which are conveniently summarised in the judgment of Johnson J in R v Rodriguez [2010] NSWSC 198 at [33].  His Honour said:
Those rules provide that every person is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary is proven.  To establish the defence of mental illness, it must be proved upon the balance of probabilities that at the time of committing the acts causing death, the Accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and qualify of his act, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons, or when he cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing:  R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190.""
31Mr Smith submitted on behalf of the accused that the Court would be satisfied of what he referred to as the second limb of M'Naghton, namely, that although the accused knew the nature and quality of his act, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  
32The Crown joined in that submission.  It nonetheless remains necessary for me to determine the issue independently in accordance with the principles outlined above.  
Evidence of the two psychiatrists
33The reports of the two psychiatrists were admitted by consent of both the Crown and the accused.  The contents of the reports were uncontested and no order was sought limiting the use to be made of that evidence.  In those circumstances, the reports are admissible to prove the accused's version of events: s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995; R v Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364 at 367-369.  It is apparent from their opinions that both psychiatrists accepted the accused's account as to his past perceptions. I am satisfied on that basis that I can rely on the reports as recording a genuine account of the accused's state of mind at relevant times. 
34The accused told Professor Greenberg that, over a period of about two years prior to the present offence, he had been hearing voices.  The accused had been feeling miserable and was in pain.  He believed he needed to relieve himself from the pain by ""going to paradise"".  The voices told him that if he killed someone and sacrificed someone, he would go to paradise.  They were ""alien"" voices from ""the galactic society in space"".
35Initially, the accused did not believe the voices.  In March 2010, he took a train to Broken Hill to go ""UFO hunting"".  After five days circumnavigating Broken Hill on foot, a series of perceptions (which I am satisfied were hallucinations) persuaded him as to the existence of UFO's and the authenticity of the voices he was hearing.  
36The accused initially attempted to follow the instructions of the alien voices by stabbing a friend but the friend survived.  The accused was charged with wounding him with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.
37The present offence occurred whilst the accused was in custody on remand in respect of that offence.  After being placed in a two-man cell with the deceased, the accused ""knew"" that if he killed the deceased, he would go to paradise.  The accused told Professor Greenberg that, after he killed the deceased, he regretted his actions because he didn't go to paradise.  Professor Greenberg reported:
He then realised that the victim was an innocent person and that if the victim was a sinner then he would have gone to paradise.  
38The accused gave a similar account to Dr Furst.  He said that, since the age of 17, he had been hearing voices that introduced him to aliens.  He also talked to birds and felt as though the television was talking to him ""in a personal way"".  The aliens told him that ""every sinner must pay the price for his death ... one person for every person who comes to Earth"".  He believed that, as he is one person, he needed to kill one person to go to paradise.
39Dr Furst reported:
[The accused] was confused when he did not go to paradise immediately after killing the victim.  He began to think that he was going to hell, stating that he thought he had been deceived.  He said, ""why would anyone tell me to kill someone if I was not going to paradise?  I asked the voices 'why have you done this to me?' but they did not answer"".  
40Dr Furst's reports record a consistent account from the accused's mother as to many aspects of that history, including the trip to Broken Hill ""waiting for the aliens to take him"".
41Both psychiatrists have diagnosed the accused as having a disease of the mind, namely, a treatment resistant schizophrenic illness.  Both are of the view that the accused was suffering from a serious mental illness at the time of the offence, with acute symptoms including persecutory and grandiosed beliefs and auditory hallucinations.
42As to whether the accused was aware of the nature and quality of his acts, both psychiatrists concluded that he was probably was.  However, both expressed the opinion that he did not know that his actions were wrong.  Dr Furst said:
[The accused] was probably aware of his actions when killing the victim; however his delusional beliefs and voices prevented him from knowing that his actions were wrong in a moral sense as he felt compelled to follow the instructions of the aliens and thought it was the right thing to do at the time.  His schizophrenic illness also deprived him of the capacity to reason about his actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure.  I believe he has the mental illness defence available to him.
43Professor Greenberg said:
I am of the view that [the accused] did likely understand the nature and quality of his act at that time period.
I am of the view that [the accused] did know the act was wrong in a legal sense, but morally he felt compelled to act as he believed he would be relieved of his suffering by killing a victim.  He falsely believed he would go to paradise as promised by the ""alien"" voices.   At that time he believed these voices were aliens from outer space.  He, in my opinion, likely did not know the moral wrongfulness of both his alleged acts.
I am of the opinion that on balance, [the accused] has the availability of a defence of mental illness.
44I accept the evidence of the two psychiatrists.  On the strength of their evidence, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, although the accused did know the nature and quality of his act in choking the deceased and did intend to kill him, he did not know what he was doing was wrong in the sense understood in the M'Naghton rules.
45Section 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act requires the judge, in the case of a trial with a jury, to direct the jury as to the legal and practical consequences of a finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness.  Before commencing the hearing, I made myself aware of those matters.  
46In accepting the defence of mental illness, it is appropriate to acknowledge the awful impact of the accused's acts and the undoubted grief of the family and friends of the deceased.  As noted by Johnson J in R v PCB [2012] NSWSC 482 at [90], the community is entitled to have explained the effect of the verdict and orders made in such a case.  The accused will remain in detention and be held as a forensic patient under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  In accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, he will not be released until the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of any member of the public or indeed the safety of the accused will not be seriously endangered by his release.  His case will be reviewed by the Tribunal every six months.  If at some point in the future he comes to be released, he may be released on conditions which would see him returned to detention as a forensic patient if his mental condition were to deteriorate to a point where he may again be a serious danger to others. 
Conclusion
47For those reasons, in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness.
48Pursuant to s 39(1) of the Act, I order that the accused be detained in a correctional centre or at such place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.
49I direct that, as soon as practicable, the Registrar notify the Minister of Health of this order.
50I direct that, as soon as practicable, the Registrar notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my determination that the accused was fit to be tried and of this order, and provide to the Tribunal the following documentation:
(a)a copy of these reasons for verdicts and orders;
(b)the transcript of the trial;
(c)the exhibits tendered by the Crown at the trial.

		16 May 2012",2012-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708193,R v Timbreza [2012] NSWDC 142,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: All of us are going to get older and some of us will become elderly to the stage where we need to be cared for by others. To care for a frail ninety-one year old man in a proper way necessarily involves indignities but the behaviour of Elma Timbreza, who appears for sentence today, was designed to heap further indignities upon an unfortunate and highly vulnerable elderly man in her care and to make matters worse she appears to have done this out of pure malice.

2She has pleaded guilty to eight offences of aggravated indecent assault and four of common assault. The circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown in each case relates to the victim's physical disability. 

3Mr John Cummins has been living at the Gertrude Abbott Nursing Home in Surrey Hills since 2006. At the time of these offences he was ninety-one years of age suffering from dementia and regarded as a high care resident. That means that he needs assistance from nursing home staff with most daily tasks including washing, dressing, going to the toilet and eating. Those sorts of things are the necessary indignities I spoke about at the beginning of these remarks on sentence. Part of his problem involves a physical impairment to his left leg which means that he cannot support his own weight or move around unassisted. He cannot even straighten that leg. His knee is permanently bent up at an angle.

4Employed at the nursing home was the Offender. She worked as an assistant in nursing. She had had that position since 2003. She was the primary carer of Mr Cummins, assisting him with all essential amenities.

5For reasons that are difficult, if not impossible, to understand the Offender took it upon herself to behave in a disgraceful way towards Mr Cummins.

6I will describe the offences themselves in a little while but I first want to make this point. In some parts of the evidence put before me there are suggestions that Ms Timbreza was responding to some provocation offered to her by Mr Cummins. It is accepted by Mr Keller who appears on the Offender's behalf that proof of provocation is a mitigating circumstance with the burden lying upon him. It is further accepted that he cannot meet that burden and so I should sentence his client on the basis that no provocation was offered.

7Sometime between March 2009 and January 2010 the Offender was working with another assistant in nursing, Ms Linhao. They were doing a morning shift and as part of their duties they were in Mr Cummin's room getting him ready for a shower. He has to be moved by a sling from his bed into the shower chair. He was then taken into a separate shower room by the Offender. She was alone with Mr Cummins in the shower room for sometime. After a little while Ms Linhao walked into the shower room to bring a towel for the victim. Upon entering the shower room she saw Ms Timbreza acting very strangely. In fact what she was doing was committing the first of the offences for which she must be sentence, an aggravated indecent assault. 

8What Ms Linhao saw was the victim seated naked in the shower chair. The shower chair has a hole in the seat to allow staff to clean the genitals and anus of the patient. Ms Timbreza was crouched down holding the shower hose in her right hand with no shower head upon it. Ms Linhao noticed that the hose seemed to be very close to Mr Cummins' anus. Suspicious of what was going on she pretended to accidentally drop what she had in her hand so that she could bend over and have a better look at what was going on. She saw that the rubber hose was going up to the anus of Mr Cummins, effectively touching him around his anal area. Ms Linhao noticed that the hose was held in that position for a couple of seconds before it was removed by the Offender. She remonstrated with Ms Timbreza saying ""that's enough Elma"". When Mr Cummins was taken back to his room to be dried he complained of being sore around his anus.

9The next two offences occurred on a different day. They are both offences of common assault. Again Ms Timbreza was teamed with Ms Linhao and again they were helping Mr Cummins get out of bed. Ms Timbreza was using a sling and she asked Mr Cummins to move forward so that she could put the sling over his head. He did not do what she asked. She reached out and slapped the victim, Mr Cummins, to the back of his head with an open hand. He said ""Stop hitting me Elma, you're hurting my head"". She then placed him in the shower chair and took him to be showered while Ms Linhao stayed in the bedroom to assist another resident. About five minutes later the Offender came back to the room pushing Mr Cummins in his shower chair. He was then dressed and moved with the sling to another chair. The Offender was standing behind Mr Cummins when she reached out and used her right hand to strike him to the back of his head in an open handed slap. Mr Cummins yelled out ""Somebody hit me on the bloody head"". The Offender said nothing but simply pushed Mr Cummins out to the dinning room.

10The next counts occurred on 1 October 2010. This time the Offender was working with another assistant in nursing, Ms Reyes. As before they were together getting Mr Cummins ready for his shower. Ms Reyes got him into the shower chair when the Offender came and stood behind Mr Cummins to push him into the shower room. She raised her hand up over Mr Cummins' head and struck downwards with the back of her hand striking the crown area of his head with the knuckles to her fingers. Mr Cummins yelled out in pain and said ""What did you do that for""? The Offender replied in an sarcastic manner saying that it was an accident and wheeled him into the shower room. That is an offence of common assault.

11About five minutes later Ms Reyes went into the shower room to ensure that there was a towel available to dry Mr Cummins. Once she got into the room Ms Reyes saw Mr Cummins sitting naked on the shower chair with the Offender crouched down holding a rubber hose. That shower head had again been removed from that hose and a small metal pipe was visible at the point of the connection where the shower head would be fitted. The Offender was holding this metal pipe end of the hose about ten centimetres from Mr Cummins' anus and water was striking him directly upon the anus. That is an offence of aggravated indecent assault.

12About ten or fifteen minutes later the Offender returned to the bedroom pushing Mr Cummins in his shower chair. He was draped with a towel and together Ms Reyes and the Offender got Mr Cummins dressed. The Offender then crouched down beside Mr Cummins and began to vigorously rub a towel back and forward in a scrubbing motion in Mr Cummins genital and anal area. As she did this she said to Ms Reyes ""I really hate this man"". Mr Cummins yelled out ""Be gentle down there, why are you doing that, stop that."" This did not stop the Offender. She merely continued to do what she had been doing for about another five minutes while laughing and looking at Ms Reyes.

13At that stage Mr Cummins was then lifted up to his chair. As she removed the towel from his genital area the Offender reached out with her right hand and used her fingers to strike one of Mr Cummins' testicles hitting them with some force. He screamed out in pain. Once more the only response of the Offender was to laugh. That is another offence of aggravated indecent assault.

14We come to the final offence that occurred a few minutes later. After Mr Cummins was moved into his chair his left leg was bent up at a forty-five degree angle. As I mentioned before he is simply physically unable to straighten his leg. For reasons that, like all the other offences, are difficult to understand the Offender reached out and pushed down on Mr Cummins' knee in an apparent attempt to straighten it. Mr Cummins told her to stop and that his knee was sore but the Offender did not stop. She continued to push down on his left knee. Indeed she placed both of her hands on his knee and then her own knee to apply further downward force on his left knee. This apparently caused the Offender some amusement. Mr Cummins yelled out in pain and again he told her to stop which, thankfully, she ultimately did.

15A few days later Ms Reyes reported these incidents, the ones she had seen, to the nurse manager of the nursing home. Management contacted the police and then an investigation commenced. Ms Linhao who observed the first three offences also came forward and made a complaint. Mr Cummins was spoken to but was only able to give a limited version as to what had occurred to him. As part of the investigation the shower hose was seized. DNA consistent with that of Mr Cummins was found on the end of the shower hose.

16Shortly after the police investigation commenced the Offender was arrested. She participated in an electronically recorded interview where she made what is now accepted to be a series of lies. In particular she denied committing these offences. She gave explanations for some of her conduct which turned out to be untrue. She denied saying ""I really hate this man"". As parts of its investigation the police intercepted the Offender's mobile telephone. During calls that were listened to and recorded by police the Offender actually admitted hitting the victim and discussed with other assistants in nursing at the home what to say to police in order to corroborate the account that she gave to police in her electronically recorded interview.

17The Offender was born in the Philippines. There is nothing in her background which would provide any explanation of her behaving in such a malicious way towards a helpless, defenceless and vulnerable ninety-one year old man. She grew up in a poor area of the Philippines and was required, with her siblings, to work long hours on the family's farm but she was not subject to any form of abuse or neglect and reported to the author of the presentence report that overall her childhood was pleasant. She shared a warm and close relationship with family members during her formative years. She came to Australia in 1984 and became an Australian citizen in 1987. She came to Australia seeking work. 

18She has been married but is now a single woman. She now socialises within a circle of friends of her church. A number of them signed a reference speaking of her being a very friendly person, kind hearted, hard worker, reliable and most especially trustworthy. That document suffers from the disadvantage, pointed out by the Crown, that there is nothing to indicate that those who have signed the document were made aware of the serious misbehaviour that the Offender had engaged in over a significant period of time.

19She lost her job, of course, at the nursing home as a result of these allegations being made. Nevertheless she has found other work. She works as a housekeeper through two different agencies. She has not told one of those agencies about these current matters. One might have thought that it was something that they should have been made aware of.

20A striking feature of the material put before me is the absence, at least in the early stages of this matter, of any understanding on the part of the Offender of just how wrong her conduct was. She has great difficulty, it would appear, empathising at all with Mr Cummins and provided only very limited insight. She claimed that some of the things she did were committed out of frustration but she denied to the author of the presentence report that her actions were inappropriate or that they were committed to intentionally cause pain.

21A psychologist's report likewise reflects a very poor understanding of the seriousness of her misconduct. Such thinking does not bode well for her behaviour in the future. Of course, because of these convictions, she will find it impossible to work in a nursing home but it could not be said that she will never again be the carer for helpless, defenceless and vulnerable individuals. 

22I cannot say that her prospects of rehabilitation are good. Her evasion and her extremely limited understanding of the wrongfulness of her conduct prevent such a finding being made.

23General deterrence is of prime importance in this sentencing exercise. There are many people in the community who require assistance in their daily needs including highly personal assistance with showering and toileting. All of them are vulnerable to misbehaviour of this kind. No doubt some of them act in a way which those caring for them might find frustrating. That is where the Courts have a part to play, making it clear that should anyone else act in the way that the Offender has acted, whether through frustration or not, significant sentences will be imposed even where, as here, these are the first offences committed after a lifetime of what appears to have been exemplary behaviour.

24To send someone to gaol for the first time at the age of fifty-five is certainly not an attractive proposition but it is a sentence that Mr Keller, on behalf of the accused, concedes must be imposed. Of course the Offender can rely on her prior good character. She is entitled to a ten per cent discount for her late plea of guilty and the Crown makes no challenge to the suggestion that I would make a finding of special circumstances in this case based presumably on her age and the fact that this will be her first time in custody.

25I note that the common assaults could have been dealt with in the Local Court and indeed probably would have been were it not for the other offences for which the Offender must be sentenced. It almost goes without saying that offences that involve a breach of trust of this kind are serious because of that circumstance. In one sense, as Mr Keller acknowledged, they were committed in Mr Cummins' home. Whatever the precise meaning of the term ""home"", Mr Cummins lived at the nursing home and he is entitled to feel safe and regard it as a place of sanctuary or refuge. To have those involved in his care subjecting him to violence and the indecent acts that I have described is, of course, a serious matter indeed.

26These offences occurred over a relatively lengthy period. It is difficult to be precise but it is around a year and there were three separate days on which these eight offences occurred. It was certainly not a case that the Offender acted out of frustration and immediately regretted what she had done. She continued to act in this disgraceful way. There was no suggestion indeed she would have stopped were it not for the fact that she was arrested. 

27I was invited to use the aggregate sentencing provisions. I will not do so. Of course the principle of totality applies. I will, as a measure of leniency, impose concurrent sentences on each of the common assault offences and each of the aggravated indecent assault charges as well although there will be partial accumulation of the sentence for the aggravated indecent assault matters on the sentences for the common assault matters.

28The sentences are follows; for each of the charges of common assault I set a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to date from 17 May 2012. On each of the charges of aggravated indecent assault I set a non parole period of one year to commence on 17 November 2012 with a head sentence on the indecent assault matters of two and a half years making an overall term of three years and effective non parole period of eighteen months. The Offender will be eligible for release to parole on 16 November 2013.

		10 September 2012",2012-05-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708203,Mattar v R [2012] NSWCCA 98,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Harrison J.

2HARRISON J: The appellant was convicted in a judge alone trial before Syme DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 25 May 2010 of one count of escaping lawful custody contrary to s 310D(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. Her Honour sentenced the appellant to a term of 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.

3In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed but the appeal against sentence should be allowed. I have come to this view for the reasons that follow.

The conviction appeal

4The appellant relies upon a number of grounds in support of the appeal against his conviction. He contends that her Honour made an error of law in her approach to the determination of proof of the appellant's guilt and made inconsistent findings of fact. Upon this basis it is contended that there was a miscarriage of justice and that the conviction cannot be supported.

5The facts were in relatively small compass. On 21 April 2009 the appellant was serving a term of imprisonment at Long Bay Correctional Centre. Two days later he was transferred to the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick for treatment of a long-standing heart condition. He remained at the hospital in lawful custody until 28 April 2009 when he left without the permission of the Corrective Services Department officers at the hospital who had charge of him at the time. His escape was effected by the simple technique of walking out of the hospital and hailing a cab.

6The burden of the appellant's submission is that her Honour's decision does not expose a line of reasoning that includes a finding beyond reasonable doubt of the essential elements of the offence. This arose principally in the context of a defence of necessity, which was raised by the appellant at his trial. In short the appellant contended that he was in fear of his life or at the very least had genuine fears for his own safety and that his departure from the hospital occurred in circumstances where he anticipated that he would be returned to the general prison population and the dangers he identified. Her Honour's decision appears to be based upon a rejection of the appellant's evidence that he held a reasonable belief when he left the hospital that his actions were necessary in order to protect himself from the risk of death or serious injury.

7The common law defence or excuse of necessity operates in circumstances that bear upon an accused person in such a way as to induce him or her to offend in order to avoid even more dire consequences. The accused bears the evidentiary onus of raising the evidentiary basis of the defence but the Crown bears the legal onus of negativing the defence to the criminal standard: Taiapa v R [2009] HCA 53; (2009) 240 CLR 95. The three elements of the defence are:

1. that the criminal act was done in order to avoid the infliction of irreparable evil on the accused, or others that he or she was bound to protect;

2. that the accused honestly believed on reasonable grounds that he or she was placed in a situation of imminent peril; and

3. that the acts performed to avoid that peril were not disproportionate to the peril to be avoided: R v Loughnan [1981] VR 443 at [448]; R v Rogers (1996) 86 A Crim R 542.

8The defence is commonly raised in cases of escape from lawful custody. The principles are discussed by Gleeson CJ in Rogers at 547 in these terms:

""...the principle of necessity is not intended to give prisoners who are threatened a choice between going on protection and removing themselves, permanently or indefinitely, from custody. If it did so, it would subvert the penal system. That is why considerations of reasonableness and proportionality go hand in hand. Considered in the abstract, and apart from any question of escape, it might be said that a prisoner's choice not to be on protection, although risky, is reasonable. However, when a prisoner who is threatened, claims that the law permits him to respond to that threat by removing himself altogether from the custody to which he has been lawfully sentenced, the question whether protection can be dismissed as a reasonable alternative takes on a different complexion.""

9It was clear from the evidence tendered at the trial that there had been threats made against the appellant so that he satisfied the first element of Loughnan. In relation to the second element, her Honour did not believe that the appellant had a reasonable belief that he was placed in a situation of imminent peril. At the time he escaped there had been no decision made to return him to gaol. In relation to the third element, her Honour found that the prison authorities had offered the appellant the choice of protection or transfer to another gaol, both of which the appellant, not without some good reason, had decided to reject. The appellant did say, however, that he felt he would be safer in the general prison population.

10Her Honour's enunciation of some of her reasons was less than ideal. The appellant emphasised the following passage in particular:

""When considering the defence of necessity, a defence of such exists where the circumstances overwhelmingly impel disobedience to the law. The law cannot leave people to choose which laws they will obey and which laws they will not obey. This case has been about the issue of necessity and whether there was in Mr Mattar's mind a reasonable belief at the time that his actions were required in order to protect himself. The findings that I have made: First, that he did not have that belief. Secondly, that if he did his actions were not a reasonable response to that belief, leave these questions to be answered firstly as follows: Did he honestly believe on reasonable grounds that his escape was necessary to avoid death or serious injury. The answer to that question for those reasons must be no. For those reasons I find the offence proven.""

11There is no reference to the criminal standard of proof or the way in which it affected her Honour's approach to or consideration of either the Crown's obligation to prove any of the elements of the offence with which the appellant had been charged, or to negative the defence of necessity.

12However, whatever difficulties may have attended her Honour's reasons or her reasoning process, counsel for the appellant at the hearing in this Court made an appropriate concession at a very early stage. That concession is encapsulated in the following brief extract from the hearing of the appeal:

""HARRISON J: ...why would not the proviso [apply]... why would the evidence not support a conviction? Assuming [the proviso] were to apply? 

BRASSIL: Your Honour, there is nothing I can put to your Honour in reply to that, that is fatal process to whatever I may attempt to say to your Honours. I can't address that question. 

There is no doubt in my view that there was a proper ground here to found a conviction. I am concerned by her Honour's difficult formulation of her task ...""

13There was in my opinion evidence before her Honour sufficient to support a conviction of the appellant. That is to say, the evidence would satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. Notwithstanding that there are points raised by the appellant in this appeal that might be decided in favour of the appellant, I consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. In the circumstances I consider that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

The sentence appeal

14The appellant's 18-month non-parole period expires on 29 November 2012. At the time of his escape the appellant was serving sentences for drug supply. His total head sentence was 5 years commencing on 28 May 2008 and expiring on 27 May 2013. The aggregate non-parole period for his sentence was 3 years expiring on 27 May 2011. Her Honour imposed a sentence for the escape of 2 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. As required by s 57(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the sentence was directed to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentence that the appellant was serving. 

15The appellant's third ground of appeal dealt with special circumstances. That ground asserted that where the sentence to be imposed was required to be accumulated on the existing sentence, her Honour erred in concluding that she was unable to make a finding of special circumstances, thereby sentencing the applicant to a period of imprisonment in which the non-parole period was disproportionately long compared to the period on parole and under supervision. 

16The appellant's significant concern is that virtually the whole of the balance of term of the original sentence is eradicated by the non-parole period for the sentence imposed by her Honour for the escape. He does not complain that her Honour correctly ordered that sentence to commence at the completion of the original sentence but he does complain that there was no finding of special circumstances when the evidence clearly supported such a finding. The appellant therefore contends that the sentence imposed by her Honour led to an unfavourable skewing of the statutory ratio. He submitted that the result of the sentence imposed by her Honour was an effective non-parole period of 4.5 years with a balance of term of 6 months. This has produced a ratio of non-parole period to head sentence of 90 percent, which even the Crown characterised as ""at first blush...an inappropriately high ratio"".

17The appellant submitted that this case was analogous to two cases to which the Court was referred. The first was Ngyuen v R [2008] NSWCCA 163 at [16] - [17] as follows:

""Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to find and/or give proper consideration to whether special circumstances were established

[16] In his Honour's reasons for sentence he said ""I considered the question of special circumstances and I do not believe that they exist"". His Honour gave no explanation for so finding. For my part, on the evidence, I regard the finding that special circumstances do not exist as manifestly untenable. His Honour's finding is to be contrasted with a case when circumstances may have been capable of being accepted as special but where, in the discretion of the sentencing judge, no such finding should be made (see R v Phillips [2003] NSWCCA 373 at [16]). In those circumstances this Court may be reluctant to intervene. 

[17] I am satisfied that the applicant's absence of any criminal antecedents, an established work history and, importantly, the fact that he did not come to fresh notice between the offence and trial, are such as should properly engender a real confidence in his ability to rebuild his life on release with the assistance of appropriate supervision and intervention. Importantly, in this case there can be no suggestion that those matters have been double-counted by reason of the fact that his Honour appears to have given no particular weight to rehabilitation although as I have found not in a way such as to constitute error (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [47]). I am satisfied that the statutory ratio can in this case be varied to result in the imposition of a non-parole period that appropriately reflects the criminality involved in the offence whilst providing for a longer parole period to facilitate this applicant's readjustment to community life upon his release.""

18The second was R v Novakovic [2004] NSWCCA 437. Sully J said this at [37] - [40]:

""[37] As to Ground 4, the learned sentencing Judge was, to say the least, to the point in dealing with the applicant's submission to his Honour that ""special circumstances"" should be found, and that a shorter than usual non-parole period should be set accordingly. His Honour said simply in his remarks on sentence: ""I do not find special circumstances justifying the variation of the normal relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period"". 

[38] The applicant contends, and I agree, that there were matters, established by credible evidence, and capable of amounting to ""special circumstances"". The applicant's written submissions summarise those matters thus: 

""... [T]he applicant was of prior good character, has never before been to prison, was contrite, is in his 50's and has good prospects of rehabilitation.""

[39] The applicant complains, and in my opinion justifiably, that his Honour, if intending to make either a specific finding that there were no circumstances capable of amounting in law to special circumstances; or that there were such circumstances available in principle, but that his Honour was not prepared to find them in fact; was obliged to give some explanation, however brief, of why he was not going to make such a finding in fact. 

[40] In my opinion there is some proper scope for some modest reduction in an otherwise appropriate non-parole period by reason of the aforesaid special circumstances. To that extent I would uphold Ground 4."" 

19In the present case, her Honour dealt with the question of special circumstances in these terms:

""I note that the offender has been in custody solely on other matters since 28 May and his parole was revoked. I acknowledge that the Act requires me in imposing a sentence to accumulate the sentence I impose today on any non-parole period that Mr Mattar was currently serving. I am unable to make a finding of special circumstances for the reasons given.""

20As far as I can determine, her Honour in fact did not give reasons at all. It was perhaps in this context that the Crown quite properly acknowledged in this Court that ""[t]he special circumstance ground is the one that poses the greatest difficulty for the respondent and perhaps for your Honours"". The Crown's submissions on this topic had emphasised that her Honour's remarks on sentence were effectively limited to a statement that ""the ratio of non-parole to parole period as set down by the Act combined with [the appellant's] currently fairly lengthy non-parole periods should adequately cater for his rehabilitation"".

21The Crown's submissions went on in the following terms:

""35. The primary focus of the sentencing court in determining the non-parole period should be the minimum period of actual incarceration necessary to reflect the multiple considerations of sentencing, not merely rehabilitation: Simpson v R [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [65]; Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36]. Where, in a case like this, the original sentence observes the statutory ratio, failure to find special circumstances will almost always lead to a ratio of non-parole period to head sentence in excess of 75 percent. If her Honour wished to maintain a ratio of 75 percent across the total combined head sentence of 5 years, an aggregate non-parole period of 3 years 8 months would have been required. This would equate to a non-parole period for the escape of only 8 months, a period that would be excessively lenient.""

22The Crown submitted that any reduction in the non-parole period would lead to a sentence that failed to reflect the very important considerations of deterrence necessary in sentencing for the offence of escape.

23The appellant contended that her Honour was in error in failing to find special circumstances on the grounds of the appellant's health, his assistance to authorities and the presence of threats to his welfare made by fellow prisoners. The evidence in this last respect indicates that it had become known in the prison that the appellant had given assistance to the Crime Commission and that the usual opprobrium attaching to inmates who were known, or even thought, to have done so had manifested itself in the form of direct threats against him. It was these threats that the appellant raised as the basis of his defence of necessity run at trial. 

24One of the matters that is covered by s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of assistance to authorities or an undertaking to assist: s 23(2)(g). It was not ever in dispute that the appellant's receipt of threats to his safety flowed from his dealings with the Crime Commission and that that translated into harsher custodial conditions for him. Superadded to that is also the fact that the appellant was suffering from an acknowledged cardiac problem, which was the reason for his admission to hospital in the first place.

25It does not seem to me upon any reading of her Honour's remarks on sentence how or why these facts alone or in combination did not warrant a finding of special circumstances and the imposition and structure of a sentence that made an appropriate allowance. I consider that this amounts to an error in her Honour's sentencing exercise and that it has led to the imposition of a sentence that is manifestly excessive. I consider that some lesser sentence is warranted in law. I am comforted to some extent in that conclusion by data collected by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. Even allowing for the frailties of statistical comparisons of sentencing trends, the latest Judicial Commission data pertaining to sentences imposed for the offences of escape or attempt to escape from lawful custody indicate that in no less than 72 percent of cases, a non-parole period of less than 18 months was imposed.

26In my opinion the appellant should be sentenced for the offence of escape lawful custody to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months. I understand that her Honour was notified of the fact that an adjustment to the commencement date of the sentence she imposed had to be made to take account of the fact that the appellant had been at large for two days following his escape, and that she adjusted that date accordingly. I have taken that fact into account in the structure of the sentence I propose.

27In my view the following orders should be made:

1. Dismiss the appeal against conviction.

2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal.

3. Quash the sentence imposed upon the appellant by her Honour Syme DCJ on 27 August 2010.

4. In lieu thereof, sentence the appellant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 31 May 2011.

5. Grant liberty to apply if considered necessary or appropriate in respect of any alteration of or amendment to the commencing date of the sentence in the light of the these remarks


28McCALLUM J: I agree with Harrison J that the appellant's appeal against his conviction should be dismissed. There was no contest at the hearing as to proof of the elements of the offence. The issue on which the trial was run was the defence of necessity. Central to the defence was the appellant's contention that he was told by a correctional services officer, Mr John Wynn, that his medical treatment was finalised and that he would be taken to 9 Wing (T47, 25.5.10). The judge rejected that evidence. Her Honour's decision was given ex tempore and must be read with that fact in mind. Whilst it may be acknowledged that the reasons might have been expressed more clearly, it is clear that her Honour was satisfied, having rejected that evidence, that the appellant did not in fact hold the relevant belief. As effectively acknowledged on his behalf, that finding was plainly open. The inevitable consequence was that the Crown had negatived the defence. On that basis, I consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

29I also agree with Harrison J as to the appeal against sentence. The only reason given by the judge for refusing to make a finding of special circumstances was that, in light of the statutory ratio, the appellant's ""current fairly lengthy non-parole periods should adequately cater for any rehabilitation"". It is clear in my respectful opinion that her Honour there overlooked the impact of the mandated accumulation of the sentence she imposed. In my view, that is a factor that should be taken into account in determining the proper sentence for an offence of escape. That is the approach I took in R v Cotterill [2012] NSWSC 89 at [55].

30I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J.

		17 May 2012",2012-05-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708206,GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him on 15 April 2011 in the District Court by Lakatos DCJ for an offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years.  The offence was aggravated by the fact that the child was under his authority, as her stepfather: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 66A(2) and (3)(d).  That section commenced on 1 January 2009.
2The aggravated offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years, which applies in respect of both the unaggravated and aggravated forms of the offence.  (The unaggravated offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.)  The sentence imposed involved a non-parole period of eight years, with a balance of term of two years eight months.
3As explained by Beech-Jones J, the trial judge erred in his approach to sentencing the applicant in adopting the approach required by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, which was overruled by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the latter judgment being delivered after the sentence was imposed in this case.  Whilst the error was without fault on the part of the sentencing judge, it remains a fact that he adopted an erroneous approach which tended to result in a higher sentence than he would otherwise have imposed.
4Despite the error, if this Court were of the view that no less severe sentence were warranted in law, it is obliged to dismiss the appeal: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3).  The error made by the sentencing judge was not immaterial; it appears that he would otherwise have imposed a lesser sentence, a course with which I would respectfully agree, for reasons given below.
5The trial judge imposed a balance of term which was one-third of the non-parole period.  That proportion was appropriate, absent a finding of ""special circumstances""; a greater proportion was open with such a finding: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 44(2).  For reasons given below, this was a case in which there should have been a finding of special circumstances.
Term of sentence6The aggravating features of the offending were significant.  First, the assault involved vaginal penile penetration.  Secondly, the victim was nine years and four months of age at the time of the offence.  Thirdly, the applicant was her stepfather, having been in a relationship for several years with the victim's mother.  (The applicant and the mother had three other children together.)  Those features alone warranted a lengthy sentence of imprisonment.
7There were also two significant mitigating factors.  First, it appears that the applicant himself had suffered ""persistent sexual abuse by his stepfather, which comprised oral and anal penetration on a weekly to fortnightly basis from age six until he was 18 years old"": Dr Emma Collins, Psychological Assessment Report, 6 September 2010, par 8.  Secondly, the applicant was sufficiently low on intelligence testing scales as to be characterised as intellectually disabled.  A report prepared in June 1988, after he had demonstrated an inability to calculate change when working in the newsagency operated by his mother and stepfather, found that he was ""within the mildly intellectually handicapped range"" and suggested that ""open market employment would be very unlikely"".  Dr Collins summarised the scores he achieved on the verbal scale as being ""within the extremely low range of ability, outperforming less than the bottom 1% of the normative sample for his age"": report, par 25.  She stated that his score on the non-verbal scale fell within ""the borderline to below average ability range, outscoring the bottom 8% of the normative aged sample"": ibid.  The applicant's intellectual limitations appeared to affect the level of his moral culpability.  Dr Collins reported (par 20):
""He advised 'she was trying to tempt me' and as such showed a preoccupation with sexualising the behaviour of children and misreading perceived 'cues' given by the victim, highlighting pro-offence attitudes and interests.  [The applicant] was able to articulate the understanding of lack of consent in children, but only to a superficial extent.""
There is no finding that he had an understanding which he could not articulate and I would not draw that inference from the report.
8The applicant also suffered a level of mental illness.  Dr Collins stated that he scored ""in the moderate range for anxiety and stress, and within the extremely severe range for depression"": Report, par 24.  So far as sentencing is concerned, the applicant's intellectual disability is double-edged.  His tendency to respond to the perceived sexuality of children is a matter of concern.  As explained at [44] to [46] by Beech-Jones J the applicant had been convicted on two prior occasions of indecent assault, and an act of indecency with a girl under the age of 10 years.  On each occasion he received a bond.  Dr Collins' opinion was that he posed a moderate to high risk of re-offending: at pars 26-28.  On the other hand, she stated at par 33:
""[The applicant] shows some evidence of long-term relationships, however it is concerning that it is at that time, when he has regular access to children, that he is most likely to sexually offend.  It seems to be a combination of his own abuse experiences and perhaps the confusion this has created regarding intimacy, in addition to the disinhibiting effect alcohol has upon his behaviour that exacerbates sexual deviance and the underlying sexual interest in children....  Moreover, he reports intermittent depression and general mood dysregulation that is another antecedent to his offending.  [His] sexualised conduct needs to be understood in the context of these aforementioned psychosocial factors.  It is commendable that he is quite frank about his sexual offending and attitudes, and this bodes well for treatment.  Furthermore, it is positive that he appears genuinely motivated to engage in offence-specific intervention.""
9Dr Collins' assessment of his ""relatively high"" risk of recidivism was qualified by her comment that his behaviour and attitudes ""whilst concerning, are relatively typical for untreated sex offenders and should moderate following intervention, pending his potentially good treatment progress"": at par 34.  She considered he would ""require ongoing intervention as part of his eventual release back into the community"" and that ""the option for a period of community-based supervision would be beneficial in order to best manage his ongoing risk in the community"".  She expressed a concern that his cognitive ability may require individual therapy, which appears not to be available through the Custody Based Intensive Treatment Program available within the prison system.
10There are individuals who pose such a high risk of serious offending, apparently without the understanding or ability to control their own behaviour, that demands of protection of society and the need for the sentence to conform to an appropriate assessment of the moral culpability of the actual offence may give rise to an acute tension.  The point was helpfully articulated in Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 in the judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in the following terms, at 476-477:
""The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform.  The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case.  They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.  And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter.  These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality.""
11Subject to the limiting consideration of the sentence which would be imposed on someone without a mental disability, it is appropriate to give careful consideration to circumstances in which the evidence indicates that the offending may to a significant extent be the product of serious and prolonged sexual abuse throughout childhood, together with a lack of understanding, to a noticeable degree, of the emotional and intellectual controls required to avoid the infliction of similar harm on others.  The critical issue in the present case is the possibility, affirmed by Dr Collins, that treatment should moderate the risk of recidivism for the applicant.  In those circumstances, it is possible to moderate the sentence which would otherwise have been required to take account of the likely limited effects of extended punishment as a form of personal deterrence and the lowered value of punishment as a form of general deterrence, in a case of reduced moral culpability.
12In considering the appropriate term, it is, of course, necessary to take into account the fact that the maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment and that there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  However, the latter must not be used as a guidepost or benchmark ""from which to commence the sentencing exercise,"" in terms adopted by the sentencing judge.  It is a factor to be taken into account.  Usually, the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence is equated with the level of moral culpability of the offender.  However, although the circumstances of the offence may justify the description of being ""in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" for such an offence, in the language of s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, where the personal characteristics of the offender reduce the level of moral culpability, that description does not identify the level of moral culpability: see Muldrock at [54].
13In these circumstances, a term of imprisonment of 12 years would have been appropriate, which, subject to the accepted 25% discount for the plea of guilty, would result in a term of nine years imprisonment.
Non-parole period14Two factors warrant a finding of special circumstances, for the purposes of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  First, although this is not the first occasion of similar offending, it is the first time that a custodial sentence has been imposed.  Secondly, there is a strong indication in the report of Dr Collins, quoted in part above, that an extended period of ongoing intervention after release on parole will be desirable, if not essential, for rehabilitation.  Further, there is at least a possibility that the necessary form of treatment for inappropriate sexual behaviour will need to be undertaken after release.  She also recommended monitoring after release.
15It may also be accepted that the period of imprisonment will impact more severely on the applicant than on other offenders, not only because of his intellectual disability, but also because he will be, and indeed the evidence demonstrates has been, identified by other inmates as a child sex offender.
16In all the circumstances, a non-parole period of six years is appropriate.
Orders17In my view, the Court should make the following orders:
(1)Grant the applicant leave to appeal from the sentence imposed on him by Lakatos DCJ on 15 April 2011.
(2)Set aside the sentence and in place thereof impose:
(a)a non-parole period of six years to date from 8 December 2009 and to expire on 7 December 2015;(b)a balance of term of three years to expire on 7 December 2018.
(3)The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 8 December 2015.
18BLANCH J: I agree with Basten JA.
19BEECH-JONES J:  This is an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed by His Honour Judge Lakatos DCJ.  The applicant pleaded guilty to one charge under s 66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 that on 4 December 2009 he had sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years in circumstances of aggravation.  The circumstance of aggravation was that the victim, his step-daughter, was under his authority (s 66(A)(3)(d)).
20Allowing for a full 25% discount on account of the applicant's plea of guilty, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 8  years and an additional term of 2 years and 8 months.  His Honour declined to vary the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term in accordance with s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
21The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for life.  The standard non-parole period was 15 years.
The Offence
22Before his Honour there was no dispute as to the circumstances surrounding the offence.  It was set out in an agreed statement of facts.
23At the time the offence was committed the victim was aged 9 years and 4 months.  The applicant had been living with the victim's mother since January 2007.  The applicant and victim's mother had three children, twin boys born in 2007 and another child born in late 2009.
24On 4 December 2009 the victim's mother was hospitalised due to complications with her pregnancy.  The victim and the twins were left in the care of the applicant.  During the evening the victim was in the shower washing her hair.  The applicant entered the bathroom and told her to ""get out of the shower"".  He was clothed.  The victim got out of the shower and the applicant then re-entered the bathroom.  He was now naked.  The applicant placed a towel around the victim's shoulders and picked her up and carried her into his bedroom.  He placed a towel on the bed. He placed the victim on top of the towel lying down on her back.  She was still naked.  The applicant then lay on top of the victim so that his stomach was touching her and he inserted his penis into her vagina.  The victim later stated that she could feel his penis inserted about half way into her vagina and she felt pain.
25The victim managed to get away.  She ran from the room and locked herself in the bedroom and dressed herself.  She waited in that room until the offender left the bedroom.  She ran back into the bedroom and locked herself in.  She later returned to her room and slept the night there.
26The next day the applicant, the victim and her siblings visited the victim's mother in hospital.  The victim asked her mother if she could stay with her at the hospital and not go home with the applicant.  She was told she could not.  She did not tell her mother of the previous night's assault.
27On the next day the victim disclosed the offence to her mother.  The victim's mother then confronted the applicant.  During the confrontation she said to him:
""Why would you do something like this?""
The applicant replied:
""I've only done it a couple of times, she is a cock tease and you're sick all the time and I didn't want to stress you out.""
28The victim's mother then contacted the applicant's mother and told her to collect him.  As he left he threatened to kill himself.  He sent the victim's mother a number of text messages including ones that said ""I had been drinking.  I am sorry I love you and the kids"" and ""I did it one time, I going to kill myself you be happy then.""
29In an interview, the victim disclosed that the applicant had engaged in acts of a sexual nature with her on other occasions prior to 2009.  The victim said she was told by the offender ""don't tell anyone"", ""I'll hurt you"" and ""I've never touched you"" after each occasion.  The victim reported that as a consequence she had cut her arm with scissors about one month prior to December 2009.  The victim's mother had noticed a number of marks on her forearm about that time.
30I address below other aspects of the material that was before his Honour as well as findings his Honour made during the course of sentencing.
Grounds 2(i) and 3: Approach to Standard Non Parole Period
31At the hearing of the appeal the applicant was granted leave to amend his grounds of appeal to include a new ground 2(i) which alleged that his Honour erred in the application of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Procedure Act by attaching to standard non-parole periods a significance that the statutory scheme does not justify. 
32At the time of the sentence hearing, his Honour was bound to apply Division 1A in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. Way was applied by this Court in R v Muldrock;  Muldrock v R [2010] NSWCCA 106.  His Honour was specifically referred to this Court's judgment in Muldrock during the course of submissions.  That decision was successfully appealed to the High Court:  Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  The High Court's decision in Muldrock was published after his Honour's judgment on sentence.  The High Court found, inter alia, that this Court's decision in Muldrock had reflected the analysis of Division 1A in R v Way and that, in this respect, Way was wrongly decided:
""25... it follows from that acceptance that Way was wrongly decided.  As will appear, it was an error to characterise s 54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms.  The Court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed on assessment of whether the offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness.
...
28.Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the Court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with the hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.""
33By his amended ground 2(i) the applicant contends that his Honour made the same mistake as the High Court found had occurred in Muldrock.  He points to the following part of his Honour's judgment as revealing an error of the type identified in the above extracts:
""The Crown contends in his written submissions and orally that the objective seriousness of the present offence is at the mid-range given the various factors which I have reviewed.  Accordingly, he contended the standard non-parole period of 15 years should be used as a guide post or bench-mark from which to commence the sentencing process.  Having reviewed a number of those Court of Criminal Appeal authorities, I am of the view that contention is made good. 
... 
I conclude as the Crown contends that this offence is at the mid range of seriousness of this offence.
The offender's plea of guilty provides a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period. Furthermore, I accept that he has an intellectual disability which makes him in my opinion an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence to the fullest extent..."" (emphasis added)
34I agree that these passages reveal that his Honour adopted an approach to the standard non-parole period which the High Court in Muldrock found was impermissible.  Needless to say this is not a criticism of his Honour.  His Honour was bound by this Court's decisions in Way and Muldrock and the Crown had referred to the latter extensively.
35The Crown sought to resist this conclusion and pointed to the following statement in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26] per Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed):
""Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error.  What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene.  Ordinarily this might occur in cases when an applicant is found guilty by a jury with the result that the sentencing judge will consider that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors could be found to justify a variation from it.  It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guide or yardstick."" (emphasis added)
36However his Honour did not refer to the standard non-parole period as ""simply a guideline or yardstick"".  Instead, the passages which I have extracted above reveal that his Honour adopted an approach of commencing with the standard non-parole period and then seeking to find factors which could ""justify a variation from it"".
37It follows that ground 2(i) should be upheld. A similar complaint was made in ground 3.  It contended that his Honour erred in adopting a two-tiered approach as opposed to the ""instinctive synthesis"" approach to sentencing discussed by McHugh J in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25;  (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] to [56].  This ground is also made out for the same reason.  His Honour's reliance on this Court's decision in Muldrock which in turn relied on Way meant that a two tiered approach was adopted.
38Before embarking upon any reconsideration of the exercise of the sentencing discretion I would need to be satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law (s  6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act).  It is convenient to address the factors affecting both issues together.  In doing so I will address the substance of the debate raised by the remaining grounds of appeal which concern the applicant's intellectual disability (ground 1), his Honour's assessment of the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence (ground 2(ii)) and the failure to find special circumstances (ground  4).
The Applicant's Circumstances 
39At the time he committed the offence, the applicant was 40 years of age.  His parents separated when he was four and he was raised by his mother.  He had little contact with his father.  When he was six his mother remarried.  His step-father had two children from a previous relationship and relations between the step-father, his biological children and the applicant were said to be problematic.
40His Honour recorded the applicant as having stated that his step-father sexually abused him and is now serving a custodial sentence inter-state for that abuse.  I am proceeding on the basis that his Honour accepted that claim.  The applicant had a difficult relationship with the mother as a result of her not having accepted the claims he made against his step-father.  The relationship subsequently improved.
41The applicant had a number of relationships with women in his adulthood. Five of them were described as being ""long-term"".  He was estranged from a fourteen year old son from one of those relationships because of his commission of this offence.  He had had a number of children from the other relationship including the twin sons he was supervising on the evening of 4 December 2009.
42The applicant attended a special school for a substantial part of his schooling.  I summarise the evidence concerning his intellectual functioning below.  He apparently had a long history of employment in manual jobs.  The material before his Honour indicated that he had a long-term problem with alcohol abuse.
43His Honour described the applicant's criminal history as not being lengthy but having contained a number of matters ""of like nature"" to the offence to which he pleaded guilty.  In 2001 and 2002 he was convicted of contravening an apprehended violence order.  On the first occasion he was placed on a bond and on the second occasion he was fined.  In 2004 he received a bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act for two counts of assault.  He received another bond under s 9 in 2005 when he was convicted of common assault and an offence of ""peep or pry"".
44There were two further convictions of much greater concern.  In 2002 he was convicted of an offence of indecent assault on a person under the age of 10 years.  For that offence he received a bond under s 9.  The offence occurred on 4 November 2000.  The victim was the daughter of his then defacto.  She was 8 years old.  The family was camping.  The victim's mother was absent from the family tent for a brief period while she was attending to the needs of one of her other children.  While she was absent the applicant rubbed the victim's vagina.
45On 12 December 2006 the applicant was convicted of a further act of indecency with a victim under the age of 10 years.  The applicant masturbated in the presence of his then defacto's 13 month old daughter.  He was given another bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  The bond was for a period of 4 years and was subject to a number of conditions concerning supervision and participation in a Specialist Adult Sexual Offender Program.
46The supervision required by the bond was terminated in May 2008.  Until that time it appears that there had been close monitoring of the applicant.
The Applicant's Intellectual Functioning and Likelihood of reoffending
47Tendered to his Honour were a probation and parole pre-sentence report dated 9 March 2011, a psychological pre-sentence assessment report prepared by a psychologist retained on behalf of the Crown (Mr Baird) and a report from a forensic psychologist retained on behalf of the applicant (Dr Collins).  Some older reports and material concerning his intellectual functioning were also tendered.
48It is necessary to consider this material in some detail having regard to four issues:  (i) the level of his intellectual function;  (ii) the connection, if any, between any impairment in his intellectual functioning and his offending behaviour;  (iii) the likelihood of his reoffending;  and (iv) the rehabilitative options that were said to be available.
49In relation to the first issue, Mr Baird stated that the material recorded that the applicant was on ""the lower extreme of intellectual functioning"" and was ""functioning in the mildly delayed ability range"".
50Dr Collins had access to some recently completed intelligence testing.  She described the testing and its outcome as follows:
""[GN] completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) on 7 July 2010, which is a brief, four-tasks intelligence test that is broken into two tasks testing verbal and non verbal skill areas. The verbal scale assesses language, comprehension, word knowledge and the capacity for verbal abstract reasoning, whilst the non-verbal scale is measured by visual-spatial reasoning and visual-motor ability. On the verbal scale, [GN] achieved a score that places him within the extremely low range of ability, out performing less than the bottom 1% of the normative sample for his age.  His score on the non-verbal scale was contrastingly higher, falling in the borderline to below average ability range, outscoring the bottom 8% of the normative aged sample.  The disparity between these two scores meant that it is inappropriate to give an overall assessment of [GN's] intelligence.  He presents with low non-verbal skills but impaired verbal competence.  The results highlight that he is a generally low functioning individual which is consistent with his personal history and presentation and interview.  He is considered to meet the criteria of an intellectual disability on the basis of these results.""
51In relation to the second issue, Mr Baird identified a number of what he described as ""dynamic factors"" that it appeared had played a role in the applicant's offending history.  He identified a sexual ""curiosity"" regarding children, an elevated sex drive and social isolation.  He added:
""The extent to which [GN's] intellectual limitations contribute to impulsivity regarding his sexual urges around children and poor problem solving regarding satisfying his needs should be explored further in a treatment setting.  Finally, it may be important to explore, in a treatment setting, the contribution to [GN's] sexual offending, of his own sexual abuse when he was younger.""
52Dr Collins did not specifically address the existence of any connection between the applicant's intellectual impairment and his offending behaviour.  However, the following conclusion in her report appears to exclude any such connection:
""It seems to be a combination of his own abuse experiences and perhaps the confusion this has created regarding intimacy, in addition to the disinhibiting effect alcohol has upon his behaviour that exacerbates sexual deviance and the underlying sexual interest in children for [GN].""
53Counsel for the applicant pointed to a statement in Dr Collins' report that he was ""able to articulate the understanding of lack of consent in children, but only to a superficial extent"" as suggestive of a causal connection between his impairment and his offending behaviour.  However the reference to his inability to ""articulate"" a matter needs to be considered in the context of the disparity between his verbal and non-verbal ability that Dr Collins explained in the extract set out above.  Dr Collins' report did not suggest that the applicant's intellectual impairment affected his ability to control his actions or appreciate that they were wrong.
54At its highest this material suggested only a weak connection between his intellectual impairment and his offending behaviour.
55Third, both psychological reports assessed the applicant's prospects of re-offending.  His Honour described both reports as ""essentially"" coming to the same conclusions.  Mr Baird described his ""overall general risk level"" as ""Moderate-High"" which rose to ""High"" in the circumstance that he was living with children and not the beneficiary of ""sex offender specific treatment"".  Dr Collins concluded:
""On the basis of the current assessment, [GN] presents an overall moderate-high risk of sexual recidivism. Risk will be highest in relation to his development of future relationships with partners who have children, given the repeated pattern of such behaviour.""
56Fourth, both sets of psychologists suggested that if he received a custodial sentence he would need to be assessed by ""custody based sex offender program staff"" to determine a suitable treatment program.  Mr Baird suggested that he would be more suited to the ""Self Regulation Programme"" rather than a program which catered for offenders with intellectual disabilities.  He added that the applicant would ""need a non parole period of between 12 and 18 months to complete the ""Self Regulation Program"".  Dr Collins also suggested that he should be assessed.  She stated that his behaviour ""should moderate following intervention, pending his potentially good treatment progress"".  As noted, Mr Baird only considered that the absence of specific treatment would lead to a moderate to high risk of recidivism being elevated to a high risk.
Other Findings
57I will briefly note a number of findings made by his Honour.
58First, his Honour found that the applicant was genuinely remorseful.
59Second, his Honour heard and accepted evidence from the applicant that there are difficulties with his incarceration including his having been assaulted.
60Third, the applicant gave evidence that he was taking tablets to restrict his sex drive.  I assume his Honour accepted that evidence.
61Fourth, having regard to the evidence of the victim to the effect that she had been abused on earlier occasions and the statements that had been made to her by the applicant, his Honour concluded that the offence was not an isolated occurrence and that the applicant was not entitled to any leniency on that account.
62Fifth, his Honour noted that the victim suffered physical pain during the incident, that it was a serious form of intercourse and that there were clearly psychological consequences for the victim.  In accordance with s 28 of the Sentencing Procedure Act his Honour received a statement from the maternal grandmother of the victim.  It appears that the victim now lives with her grandmother.  She described a number of adverse changes in the victim's behaviour including that the victim was now more ""wary of people, particularly males"",  appeared to be suffering from anxiety  and had become withdrawn.  Whereas previously she was a compliant child, she had become more emotional and easily moved to tears.  She experienced poor sleep patterns and nightmares.
63Annexed to that statement was a letter written by the victim on 16 October  2010 to her mother.  It describes her anguish at being separated from her mother and her siblings.  It seems that she had been taken from them and placed with her grandmother.  Distressingly, she blames herself for that having occurred.  She wrote that, if she had not disclosed the applicant's conduct, she might be still living with her mother and siblings.  In describing this, his Honour found, ""as sad a picture as it paints, the physical and mental harm are I believe of no greater substantial harm than would normally occur to a 10 year old sexually molested by her step-father"".
64This finding needs to be put in context.  His Honour was required to characterise the harm in that manner because it would have been erroneous to take into account a characteristic or consequence of the offence, which even though not an element of the offence, is likely to be reflected in the maximum penalty and any applicable standard non-parole period (see R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [25] per Basten JA and cases there cited).  In this case, the maximum penalty for the offence is a sentence of life imprisonment.  The standard non-parole period is 15 years.  Such penalties comprehend very serious consequences for the victims and others if the provision is contravened.  The circumstances of this case amply demonstrate that.
65Sixth, overall his Honour characterised the offence ""at the mid range of the seriousness of this offence.""  Ground 2(ii) of the appeal complained that in doing so his Honour impermissibly strayed from considering only ""the nature of the offending"" (Muldrock at [28]) and had regard to the fact that the applicant was still the subject of a bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act at the time he committed the offence.  This can be accepted but his Honour's overall characterisation of the seriousness of the offence was still correct.
Further Evidence
66At the hearing of the application an affidavit from the applicant was read on the basis that the Court would consider in the event that it proposed to resentence the applicant.  He describes being abused and assaulted by other inmates who suspect (correctly) that he is a sex offender.  He describes brief contact with his mother and how he misses his family.  He has undertaken some wood-working courses.  He states that he has seen the ""mental health lady"" once and is taking anti-depressants and blood pressure medicine.  He states that he wants to undertake a ""Sex Offenders' Program"" but it is his belief that it is not available at the gaol at which he is detained.
67An affidavit from a solicitor for the Crown was also read on the appeal on the same basis.  Based on her inquiries it appears that the applicant undertook a ""Problem Solving Program"" for people with disabilities in 2010.  He attends Alcoholic Anonymous meetings every second week and has completed a ""Work Readiness Course"".  The affidavit confirms that he has been recommended for the ""Preparatory Sex Offenders' Program"" which is available at his current gaol and the ""Self Regulation Sex Offenders' Program"".  He is on a waiting list for the latter program.  When a place becomes available he will be transferred to the gaol which administers that program.  It is not stated how long that will take.
Intellectually Impaired Offenders
68The applicant sought to draw support from Muldrock in four respects.  First, he relied on Muldrock to establish that his Honour erred in the approach that was adopted to the standard non-parole period.  Second, he relied on the discussion in Muldrock as to the approach to be adopted in sentencing offenders who suffer from an intellectual disability.  Third, he relied on the reasoning in Muldrock for the overturning of this Court's failure to find ""special circumstances"" in that case.  Fourth, he relied on the reasoning in Muldrock for quashing the head sentence of nine years on the basis that it was manifestly excessive (Muldrock at [60]).  He contends that his circumstances were sufficiently similar to warrant a conclusion that a lesser sentence was ""warranted in law"".
69I have already accepted the first contention and will now address the second issue.  In describing the approach to be taken towards offenders who suffer from an intellectual disability the High Court in Muldrock stated (at [53] to [55]):
""53.... One purpose of sentencing is to deter others who might be minded to offend as the offender has done. Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this [citing R v Mooney (unreported, Supreme Court, Vic, Full Court, 1 June 1978)]:
""General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.""
In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way:
""[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.""
54The principle is well recognised [authorities cited]. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence [citing R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71]. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.
55In this case, there was unchallenged evidence of the causal relation between the appellant's retardation and his offending in the reports of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels. The fact that the appellant possessed the superficial understanding of a mentally retarded adult that it was wrong to engage in sexual contact with a child and that he told childish lies in the hope of shifting the blame from himself were not reasons to assess his criminality as significant [citation omitted], much less to use him as a medium by which to deter others from offending."" 
70The unchallenged evidence of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels was material suggesting that the appellant in Muldrock had little or no control over his actions due to his mental retardation (Muldrock at [40] to [41]).
71One of the cases cited in [54] of Muldock as recognising the relevant principle was R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67.  The second sentence of [54] cites the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Engert at 71.  At 71 his Honour stated, inter alia:
""Similarly, in Letteri (NSW CCA unreported 18 March 1992), Badgery- Parker J said:
The principle then is clear enough. It is correctly stated as follows: that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise.
I emphasise the concluding sentence in that passage.
.........
In truth however, for the reasons given at the commencement of this judgement, the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles.  The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system."" (emphasis)
72The reference to the ""commencement of the judgment"" in this passage is to 84 A Crim R 67 which includes the following statement (at 69.6):
""It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances.  In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in light of the purpose to be served by the sentencing exercise.""
73I have cited these passages from Engert at length in order to demonstrate that Muldrock did not overturn the principles usually applied in this State to dealing with offenders who suffer from a mental disorder or an intellectual disability.  To the contrary it confirmed their application (see DPP (Cth) v De la Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177], per McClellan CJ at CL).
74For the purposes of this application two matters should be noted.  First, a conclusion that an offender suffers from an intellectual disability does not necessarily lead to a complete rejection of either general deterrence, retribution or denunciation as factors in sentencing.  Such a conclusion might have no consequence or only result in a diminution in the weight attached to that factor.  The extent of that diminution, if any, is a matter for the sentencing judge at first instance and will depend upon an interplay of factors including the extent of the disability.  It may be that in some cases the need for general deterrence is completely removed and the weight to be attached to denunciation and retribution is substantially diminished.  Thus later in Muldrock at [58] the High Court found that punishment and denunciation did not require ""significant emphasis"" in that case and there ""was no requirement for general deterrence"".  This result followed from an assessment of the evidence of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels that I have described.
75Second, the diminution of the weight attached to, or even the removal of, general deterrence, denunciation and retribution as factors in the sentencing process may, but not necessarily will, lead to a lesser sentence being imposed.  Although Gleeson CJ's comments in Engert concerned persons suffering from a mental disorder they are equally applicable to persons who have an intellectual disability.  Thus, the greater weight that attaches to such factors as specific deterrence, the need to protect the community and the prospects of rehabilitation which flow from the diminution in weight attaching to other factors, does not necessarily operate in the offender's favour.  An example is a case where the offender's intellectual disability is considered relatively mild, culpability is high and the prospects of rehabilitation are bleak.  In such a case the need for specific deterrence and protection of the public may warrant a sentence no lesser in length than if general deterrence was fully engaged.
The Applicant's Sentence
76I will turn to the third and fourth matters raised by the applicant in reliance on Muldrock. At the outset it should be noted that on these issues the applicant has moved from relying on the principles stated in Muldrock to seeking to rely on the specific findings made by the High Court in Muldrock. I address the argument as framed but it needs to be firmly kept in mind that those findings concern another case involving different facts. They are not binding on me in the exercise of the function that I am undertaking at this point under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That said, the High Court's reasoning in support of its finding that the sentence imposed on Muldrock was manifestly excessive provides an example of the application of the principles it stated and its conclusions inform the task that I am undertaking. Further the approach of comparing and contrasting the features of this case with those of Muldrock assists in the elucidation of my reasoning.
77The appellant in Muldrock pleaded guilty to one offence under s  66A of the Crimes Act 1900.  He had sucked the penis of a nine year old boy.  At the time he committed the offence the appellant was aged 30. He had been assessed as suffering a ""mild intellectual disability"".  The appellant had committed a similar offence seven years previously while living with his parents in Queensland.  At the sentence hearing evidence was received that he was eligible for admission to a residential treatment facility known as ""Selwood Lane"".  It was designed to assist intellectually handicapped individuals to moderate their sexually inappropriate behaviour.  It was a secure facility where staff were directed to maintain ""line of sight supervision [of residents] at all times"" (Muldrock at [45]).
78The sentencing judge in Muldrock imposed a term of imprisonment of nine years with a non-parole period of 96 days.  The ratio of those two periods reflected a finding of special circumstances.  The non-parole period was backdated to the commencement of his incarceration so that he was to be released on the date of the imposition of his sentence.  It was a condition of his release on parole that he reside at Selwood Lane.  This was erroneous as his Honour did not have power to impose a parole condition for a sentence of more than three years (Muldrock at [4]).
79The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected an appeal against the term of nine years but upheld a Crown appeal against the non-parole period.  It overturned the finding of special circumstances (R v Muldrock [2010] NSWCCA 106 at [34]).  The Court substituted a non-parole period of six years and eight months and a balance of sentence of two years and four months.
80The High Court found that the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in finding that there were no special circumstances (Muldrock at [58]) and quashed the term of nine years imprisonment on the basis that it was manifestly excessive (Muldrock at [60]).  The case was remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal for the appellant to be resentenced in accordance with the High Court's reasons.  His resentencing is yet to occur.  Nothing in these reasons addresses what the outcome of that process should be.
81As I have stated, in contending for both a shorter term of imprisonment and a finding of special circumstances the applicant points to the various similarities between his case and that of Muldrock.  He submitted:
""Like the appellant in Muldrock, the applicant met the criteria for mild intellectual disability, he was effectively illiterate, had attended a special school, had suffered from sexual assault whilst he was a child and had committed prior related offences.""
82Bearing in mind the limitations on this exercise of comparison that I have referred to above, I will address this argument by comparing and contrasting the evidence concerning the intellectual disability of the appellant in Muldrock and its connection with the offence he committed and that of the applicant.  I have already referred to the two reports in Muldrock which were prepared for his sentencing for an earlier offence which described the history and extent of his impairment (Muldrock at [39] to [40]).  The High Court's description of the evidence concerning his intellectual functioning included the following (at [42]):
""Professor Hayes reported that the appellant's IQ Composite Standard Score of 62 was indicative of a mild intellectual disability. The appellant functions at a level lower than 99% of the population. His receptive and expressive language is equivalent to that of a child aged five and a half years. Test results measuring the appellant's ability to communicate, daily living skills and level of socialisation (adaptive behaviour) confirmed the diagnosis of mild intellectual disability. The appellant functions in the lowest 0.1% of the population in terms of his adaptive behaviour.""
83The High Court recorded that Professor Hayes' evidence was that the appellant had ""deficits in empathy"" ([43]) and ""would benefit from a program designed for a sex offender with an intellectual disability"" ([44]).
84I have described the evidence concerning the applicant's intellectual functioning above.  Although it was impaired it was qualitatively superior to that of the appellant in Muldrock.  On the non-verbal scale he functioned above the bottom 8%.  Although his functioning on the verbal scale was less than 1% nothing in the material suggested he had the ""receptive and adaptive language of a child aged five and a half years"" as was the case with the appellant in Muldrock.  Further, as I have explained, the connection between his intellectual functioning and the commission of the offence was at best weak.  There was no evidentiary equivalent of the evidence of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels.
85In Muldrock the Court considered that the material concerning the causal relation between the appellant's retardation and his offending behaviour meant that he had ""limited moral culpability for his offence"" (at [58]).  The Court found that there ""was no requirement for general deterrence"" and that retribution and denunciation ""did not require significant emphasis"" (at  [58]).  In this case his Honour found the applicant's intellectual disability makes him ""an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence to the fullest extent.""  I consider that reflects the correct approach for this case.  His intellectual functioning was impaired but not to a degree that significantly affected his moral culpability for the offence.  It did not warrant the removal of general deterrence as a factor altogether.  Further, the other sentencing factors remained.  I will consider these further in the context of considering whether special circumstances exist, but their comparative elevation did not warrant any lesser overall term of imprisonment in the circumstances of this case.
86One obvious difference between the two cases is that the applicant's offence was committed in circumstances of aggravation.  The appellant in Muldrock was convicted under a previous form of s 66A which prohibited sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years and specified a maximum penalty of 25 years.  Since 1 January 2009 that offence and penalty is found in s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act.  Subsection 66A(2) prohibited that conduct in circumstances of aggravation and provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life (see Crimes Amendments (Serious Offences) Act 2008).  A maximum term of life imprisonment is the most emphatic statement of the seriousness of the offence that the legislature may make.
87In concluding that the sentence of nine years imposed by the sentencing judge in Muldrock was manifestly excessive the High Court found (at [60]):
""A fundamental precept of the criminal law is that a sentence should not be increased beyond that which is proportionate to the crime in order to extend the period of protection of the community [citations omitted]. The distinction between extending a sentence to protect society and taking into account society's protection in determining the appropriate sentence may not always be easy to draw [citations omitted]. The expert evidence did not provide a foundation for the conclusion that the appellant's sexually aberrant behaviour could not be controlled by treatment and a program addressing the matters identified in Professor Hayes' report. The appellant's mental retardation and the fact that he has not previously served a sentence of full-time custody, together with the circumstances of the offence, the nature of the intercourse, its short duration and the absence of accompanying threats or other intimidating behaviour, did not warrant the imposition of a term of nine years' imprisonment (after reduction for the plea of guilty). The sentence was manifestly excessive.""
88This passage highlights the significant differences between the applicant's case and the appellant's case in Muldrock.  In the applicant's case the expert evidence did not provide a foundation for a conclusion that his aberrant behaviour could be controlled by treatment or any program available in or out of custody.  Dr Collins was only prepared to state that his behaviour ""should moderate"" if suitable treatment was available.  The extent of the moderation was not predicted.  Given her assessment of him as having a moderate to high risk of recidivism it would be unlikely to be significant.  Neither Mr Baird's report nor his past history would support such an assessment.
89The ""circumstances of the offence"" including the ""nature of the intercourse"" and its duration were all more severe in the applicant's case compared with the appellant in Muldrock.  I have already described the intercourse that occurred.  The events transpired over a period of time and involved the victim feeling terrified and vulnerable in her own home.  Unlike the appellant in Muldrock, in the applicant's case there were ""accompanying threats"" and ""other intimidating behaviour"".
90The above discussion highlights that there are a number of points of difference between this case and Muldrock namely the level of the applicant's intellectual functioning, the connection between his impaired functioning and the commission of the offence, his moral culpability, the maximum sentence and the circumstances of the offence.  Those factors and the other matters that arose on the sentencing that I have described above lead me to the conclusion that, subject to considering the question of special circumstances, no interference with the sentence imposed is warranted.
Special Circumstances
91There remains the applicant's contention that a finding of ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act was and is warranted.  Again he relies on Muldrock.  I repeat the comments I have made above concerning the difficulties with that approach.
92At [57] of the judgment in Muldrock, the High Court found that the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in determining the structure of a sentence ""upon a view that the appellant would benefit from treatment while in full time custody.""  The Court stated that such custody is punitive and the availability of rehabilitative programs is a matter for the executive and ""no confident prediction"" can be made that an offender would participate in any such program.  The affidavits read on this application are completely consistent with this.  Their Honours continued (at [58]):
""The desirability of the appellant undergoing suitable rehabilitative treatment was plainly capable of being a special circumstance justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence.  The Court of Criminal Appeal was wrong to hold that Black DCJ had been diverted by the evidence concerning Selwood Lane, and that he failed to carry out the task required of a sentencing judge [reference omitted] in focusing on rehabilitation and not on denunciation, punishment and deterrence [reference omitted]. As explained, punishment, in the sense of retribution, and denunciation did not require significant emphasis in light of the appellant's limited moral culpability for his offence. And there was no requirement for general deterrence. It was open to Black DCJ to view personal deterrence as likely to be advanced by a sentence that required the appellant to undergo appropriately tailored treatment in a secure facility such as Selwood Lane. The Court of Criminal Appeal erred in finding that there were no special circumstances within s44(2) of the Sentencing Act [citations omitted]."" (emphasis added)
93The emphasised part of this paragraph confirms that an exercise of the power conferred by s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act in a manner favourable to the offender does not involve merely considering whether there are any distinctive features of the offender's case but whether any such features warrant a variation of the ratio between the non parole period and the additional term.  Subsection 44(2) refers to a Court deciding that there are ""special circumstances for [the balance of term] being more"" than one third of the non-parole period.
94The applicant's intellectual impairment and the circumstance that, prior to committing this offence, he had not previously served a period of imprisonment, were clearly capable of contributing to a finding that there were ""special circumstances for [the balance of term] being more"" than one third of the non-parole period.  However that is not the conclusion of the inquiry.  In Muldrock the requirement for general deterrence was removed.  Retribution and denunciation were said not to require significant emphasis (Muldrock at [58]).  One can see how the objectives of specific deterrence and rehabilitation could be furthered by varying the statutory ratio so as to enable him to take up a place (at some point) in the heavily supervised environment of Selwood Lane.
95Unlike the sentencing judge in Muldrock, in this case his Honour was not presented with any program of ""suitable rehabilitative treatment"" which could justify any variation in the statutory ratio (cf Muldrock at [58]).  Further the requirement for general deterrence was not removed although it had reduced emphasis.  The objectives of specific deterrence, rehabilitation and denunciation remain.  Nothing in the evidence suggested that these objectives, or any of them, would be furthered by any variation in the statutory ratio.  In particular the material did not suggest that any period of intensive treatment or supervision beyond that which was likely to occur during a balance of term which bore the usual ratio to the non-parole period would make any appreciable difference to the applicant's risk of reoffending.  The further evidence tendered on the appeal does not alter this assessment.
96It follows that I do not consider that a finding under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act should be made and that I do not consider that a different sentence to that imposed by His Honour is warranted in law.
97Accordingly the orders I propose are:
(1)The application for leave to appeal be granted; and(2)The appeal be dismissed.

		17 May 2012",2012-05-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708207,Urriola v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 95,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  On 27 October 2009, the applicant pleaded guilty to the following counts on indictment:
(1) accessory after the fact to the murder of Paul Elliott contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 349;(2) supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, s 25(2).
2The offence of accessory after the fact to murder carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  The offence of supply a commercial quantity of cocaine carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed for this offence.
3Sixteen additional offences were taken into account by way of a Form 1, attaching to the offence of supply a commercial quantity of cocaine (count 2).  The Form 1 offences were as follows:
(a) 14 offences relating to the possession of prescribed restricted substances, contrary to the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966, s 16.  The maximum penalty for an offence under that section is 20 penalty units and or 2 years imprisonment.
(b) An offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime contrary to the Crimes Act, s 193C(1).  The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years imprisonment.
(c) An offence of possessing ammunition without being licensed to do so contrary to the Firearms Act 1996, s 65(3). This offence carries a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units. 
4The applicant was sentenced by Fullerton J on 30 April 2010 as follows:
Count 1:  a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 20 January 2009 and to expire on 19 July 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months to expire on 19 January 2015.
Count 2:  a fixed term of 2 years 6 months imprisonment to commence on 20 January 2012.
5The applicant sought leave to appeal against the sentence upon the following proposed grounds of appeal: 
""1. The Learned Sentencing Judge erred in that the sentence imposed for count 1 was manifestly excessive.
2. The Learned Sentencing Judge erred in structuring the sentences such that the total non-parole period imposed was in excess of 90% of the total sentence imposed.
3. The Learned Sentencing Judge erred by failing to impose a non parole period in relation to the second count in accordance with s.45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""  
Ground 3 was added by leave of the Court granted on the day of the hearing of the sentence appeal.
6Save for two factual matters that I will identify below, her Honour's summary of facts on the sentence hearing was not disputed.  The following exposition of those facts is derived from her Honour's remarks. 
7The accessory after the fact of murder offence arose out of assistance the applicant provided to a Michael Christiansen to dispose of the body of the deceased and to destroy the deceased's car in circumstances where the applicant knew that Christiansen had murdered the deceased the previous day.  The offence of supply commercial quantity of cocaine involved a joint criminal enterprise in which the applicant participated with Christiansen to supply cocaine over a period of weeks before the murder.
8The more detailed facts of the accessory after the fact charge were as follows.  On 6 December 2008, Christiansen murdered the deceased by shooting him in the chest at close range.  The murder took place at rented home unit premises in a Sydney suburb.  Her Honour found that Christiansen had been contracted to murder the deceased by a person with whom the deceased was in dispute regarding a drug debt.  Her Honour characterised the murder as a contract killing.  This is one of the two factual matters disputed by the applicant.  Her Honour considered the fact that the applicant was unmoved by the murder being a contract killing was relevant to an assessment of the objective criminality of that offence.  After killing the deceased, Christiansen put the body in a large metal toolbox that he had purchased for the purpose of transporting and disposing of the body.
9On the evening of the murder, by pre-arrangement, the applicant met Christiansen at Christiansen's home.  Christiansen told the applicant that he had done a job for ""the Asian guy"".  This person was ""Tong"".  The applicant asked how much he had been paid for the job and Christiansen told him that he had been paid with 12 pounds of methylamphetamine.  Christiansen showed the applicant the deceased's body in the toolbox.  Arrangements were made for the applicant to return the following day to assist Christiansen to transport the toolbox to a boat with the intention of disposing of the deceased's body at sea.
10The following morning, the applicant accompanied Christiansen to a storage unit that Christiansen had rented some months earlier in a false name to store drugs, firearms and money.  The applicant had been given access to the storage unit to store his own anabolic steroids and other restricted substances associated with bodybuilding.  Christiansen showed the applicant the methylamphetamine that he had been given in payment for the killing and the handgun he had used for that purpose.
11Christiansen and the applicant returned to Christiansen's home, where they were met by Jeremy Postlewaight and Sean Waygood.  Postlewaight had towed a large motorboat to Christiansen's home, for the purposes of transporting the toolbox containing the deceased's body out to sea.  Christiansen informed Waygood that he had killed someone and had to get rid of the body.  At this point, the applicant motioned with one of his hands to simulate the discharge of a firearm and commented that Christiansen had ""done good"".  Her Honour considered this comment was also relevant to an assessment of the objective criminality of the offending on the first count.
12Christiansen travelled with Postlewaight in the truck towing the boat to Drummoyne.  The applicant followed in Christiansen's van.  The boat was launched into Sydney Harbour and Christiansen, Postlewaight and the applicant motored through Sydney Heads into water of an approximate depth of 130 m.  En route, Christiansen used a cordless drill to drill two holes in the toolbox to facilitate it sinking quickly when pushed overboard.  Postlewaight tied an anchor to the toolbox and the three lifted the toolbox and pushed it overboard.  It sank within seconds and has not been retrieved.
13In her remarks on sentence, Fullerton J stated that the applicant had drilled the holes in the toolbox.  This was the second factual error of which the applicant makes complaint.  The Crown does not dispute this error. 
14Later that night, the applicant accompanied Christiansen to where the deceased's car had been left and waited whilst Christiansen set the vehicle alight.
15Christiansen was arrested on 16 December 2008 at the storage facility.  At that time, the police were unaware of the deceased's murder, or indeed that he was even missing.  However, they found numerous items of the deceased's personal property in the storage unit which, together with a police report in respect of the burnt-out car, caused the police to carry out investigations into his disappearance.  Quantities of cocaine and a large amount of money were also located in the storage unit.
16The applicant was also arrested on 16 December 2008 when he arrived at the storage facility.  The applicant participated in an ERISP in which he made partial admissions in respect of the possession of steroids and other restricted substances stored in the storage facility.  On 20 January 2009, the applicant was charged with supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine, being referable to the combined quantities of drugs found in the storage unit and in Christiansen's car.  The applicant declined to answer questions in relation to that matter.
17On 11 February 2009, the applicant attended a meeting at the New South Wales Crimes Commission where he was informed he was suspected of being involved in the murder of the deceased.  He did not know at this time that Christiansen had made full admissions in respect of the murder and the disposal of the body.  The applicant provided an induced statement in which he provided details of his knowledge of the murder and his involvement in the disposal of the body, as well as details of the roles played by Christiansen, Postlewaight and Waygood.  The applicant also provided details of his involvement in the supply of cocaine, particularly in the period 1 December to 16 December 2008, being the period of the charge on the second count.  In addition, he provided details of his involvement in an ongoing course of supply over the previous 12 months.  The trial judge found that the induced statement represented a comprehensive and truthful account of the offender's criminal association with his co-offenders.  
18The applicant signed an undertaking to give evidence against Christiansen and Postlewaight.  He also gave an undertaking to give evidence against the person who contracted Christiansen to kill the deceased.  Her Honour accepted that the applicant's evidence would strengthen the case against each of these persons.
19The trial judge allowed a combined discount of 45 per cent for the applicant's early plea and assistance to authorities.
The applicant's subjective circumstances
20The trial judge set out the applicant's subjective circumstances in detail and, accordingly, it is sufficient to review them briefly for the purposes of these reasons.  The applicant was born on 30 March 1984 and had no prior criminal record.  He had been brought up in a loving and supportive family.  As one of three children, his father gave evidence that the applicant had been the ""easiest to parent"".  He was well-regarded at school and by friends.  He was a promising footballer.  He worked with his father in a landscaping business and completed a certificate in horticulture.  Having obtained this qualification, the applicant then worked as a landscaper for different companies.
21An injury to be applicant's left knee effectively brought his potential football career to an end and also affected his ability to work as a landscaper.  As a result of the knee injury, he was prescribed Panadeine Forte.  He was also prescribed hormonal therapy to enhance his physique.  The applicant also commenced to experiment with cocaine at this time.  It was against this background that the applicant introduced himself to Christiansen at a gymnasium in Surry Hills with a view to training with him and eventually to compete as a bodybuilder.
22The applicant left home in 2005 to be closer to the gym and to Christiansen.  He commenced to use steroids which he acquired through Christiansen.  Over the succeeding 12 months, the applicant became financially indebted to Christiansen, borrowing from him to supplement the cost of his training and drug use.  At the time of his arrest, the applicant estimated that he owed Christiansen between $8,000 and $10,000.  The applicant saw little of his family during this period of time and his father was completely unaware of the applicant's use of steroids and cocaine.
23The applicant's relationship with Christiansen intensified in 2008 and pursuant to Christiansen's advice, he became an habitual user of steroids.  His use of cocaine also increased significantly at this time.  Christiansen was his supplier.  In order to support the cost of his training and escalating drug habit, the applicant became Christiansen's driver on cocaine supply runs.  He was paid between $200 and $500 a day for this assistance.
Trial judge's assessment of the seriousness of the offences 
24The trial judge found, at [30], that the applicant's offending in respect of the accessory after the fact charge was of a most serious kind, but was not a worst case category.  Her Honour found the applicant was a willing assistant, both in the disposal of the body and the destruction of the motor vehicle.  The applicant had not been taken by surprise when Christiansen sought his assistance.  He knew that Christiansen had murdered the deceased.  The applicant also had an opportunity over the night of 6 December 2008 to withdraw from assisting Christiansen to dispose of the body the following day.  Her Honour found that the applicant's conduct was mitigated by his youth and his absence of a prior criminal record, as well as his psychological vulnerability that motivated his loyalty to and reverence for Christiansen.  
25Her Honour considered that the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending on the drug supply count was below the mid range, given that he was subject to Christiansen's ""direction and instruction"":  see at [42] and [44].  Her Honour considered that the drug possession matters on the Form 1 related to the applicant's possession of substances for his personal use.  Her Honour stated that the proceeds of crime charge and the possession of ammunition charge contained in the Form 1 appeared to be based on his access to the storage unit in which the money and bullets were stored.  The access to the unit meant that he had shared custody and control of the contents of the unit.
26Her Honour accepted, at [47] and [50] respectively, that the applicant was remorseful and that there were ""sound prospects of rehabilitation"".  Her Honour also took into account, at [46], that a substantial part of the sentence would be served on protection and would thus be more onerous.
Ground 1:  the sentence imposed for the accessory offence was manifestly excessive. 
27The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder was manifestly excessive.  He contended that a term of imprisonment of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and an additional term of 1 year 6 months, being the sentence imposed after the allowance of a discount of 45 per cent, represented a starting point for the sentence of a non-parole period above 8 years and an additional sentence of above 3 years.  He contended that sentence, by comparison with other cases, was manifestly excessive.
Alleged factual errors by the trial judge
28Before considering the cases upon which the applicant relied in support of this ground of appeal, it is convenient to refer to the two factual errors the applicant alleged were made by the trial judge in her remarks on sentence.  The first error was her Honour's statement that the applicant drilled the holes in the toolbox so that it would sink more easily.  This was an error, as conceded by the Crown.  Unlike other findings made by her Honour, she did not say, in respect of the applicant's involvement, that it was relevant to the assessment of the objective criminality comprehended by the offending in respect of this charge. 
29For myself, I would have thought that had the applicant undertaken that activity, it would have been relevant to the objective criminality involved.  The absence of any such comment by her Honour may indicate that her Honour's use of the word ""offender"" in making this finding was a slip and that she intended to refer to the offender Christiansen. 
30The likelihood that this was so is gleaned from the discussion that arose during the sentence hearing.  Her Honour drew attention to a discrepancy in the statement of agreed facts on sentence as between para [2], which stated that Christiansen drilled the holes and para [49], where it was stated the applicant had drilled the holes.  Her Honour also drew attention to the fact that the applicant in his induced statement, at [41], stated that Christiansen had drilled the holes.  Having brought the matter to the attention of the parties, the Crown Prosecutor informed her Honour that there was an error at para [49] of the statement of agreed facts and that it should be amended to read ""[w]hilst travelling, Christiansen used a cordless drill"".  
31The Crown submitted that her Honour's remarks on sentence merely failed to reflect the correction made in the course of the sentence hearing and ought not to be considered an error in her Honour's understanding of the facts.  I agree with this submission.  Her Honour's error in referring to the applicant drilling the holes should be treated as a typographical error.
32The other alleged error was in her Honour's reference to the murder of the deceased as being a contract killing.  The applicant submitted that the evidence established that the arrangement between Christiansen and Tong was that Christiansen was to provide protection to Tong when the deceased came to see him including, if necessary, murdering the deceased. In my opinion, such an arrangement could properly be described as a contract killing.  Certainly the evidence supported a finding that Christiansen fully anticipated that he might murder the deceased during the course of the deceased's visit to Tong.  He had brought a toolbox with him large enough to take the body and was at all times armed with a loaded firearm.  
33The Crown submitted that the question of whether this was a contract killing was also ventilated in the sentence hearing.  Her Honour remarked that ""[i]t is a contracted execution, there is no question about that"" and ""he knew he had executed him and he knew he was paid for it"".  The Crown pointed out that counsel then appearing for the applicant did not cavil with her Honour's remarks.  This submission reinforces the conclusion to which I have arrived, that there was no error in her Honour's finding that this was a contract killing.
Sentences imposed in other cases 
34The applicant referred to sentencing statistics which indicated that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was significantly higher than the sentences generally imposed for this offence.  His submission acknowledged the limitations of statistics in determining the proper sentence to be imposed in a particular case.  The applicant also referred to decisions in the New South Wales Supreme Court where lesser sentences had been imposed for this offence in cases involving greater objective criminality.  Those cases were R v Almirol (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 323;  R v Galea [2003] NSWSC 465 and R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944.  
35In Almirol, the accessorial offence included assistance, albeit in a subsidiary role, in cutting up the deceased's body, disposing of the body parts and cleaning up the murder site.  The trial judge considered that an appropriate sentence was 5 years, subject to a reduction for the accused's plea of guilty.  
36In Galea, a head sentence of 7 years and a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was imposed on the accused, who had assisted in the decapitation and the disposal of the deceased's body.  
37In Faulkner, the accused was present when the murders were committed.  He then moved the victims' cars, assisted in loading the bodies onto a trailer and in dumping and burning the bodies.  He also kept a lookout over the site where the bodies had been dumped.  A head sentence of 4 years 4 months was imposed with a  non-parole period of 2 years 8 months. 
38The applicant submitted that the objective seriousness of each of the offences in these cases was greater than in his case.  
39The proper use that may be made of past sentencing decisions was considered recently by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45;  242 CLR 520 where the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) endorsed the observations of Simpson J on this topic in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194;  205 A Crim R 1.  The plurality said:
""[54] In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.' But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix 'the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence' (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, 'it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned'.
[55] As the plurality said in Wong:
'[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.'""  (citations omitted)
40There are three other principles that are relevant.  The first is the general principle that there is no single sentence that must be imposed.  The sentence to be imposed depends upon the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender:  see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357.  The second is that the question for an appellate court is whether the sentence imposed is within the proper range:  see R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371 per Hunt CJ at CL.  The third is the notion of consistency in sentencing, a matter adverted to in Hili, at [56], in the context of federal sentencing, but which is an important aspect of sentencing generally. 
41In the present case, the applicant was one of three offenders involved as an accessory after the fact to the deceased's murder.  At the time of his arrest, the offender Postlewaight was on parole in respect of a drug offence.  Postlewaight was also sentenced by her Honour.  In her remarks on sentence in respect of Postlewaight her Honour observed, at [7], that the commission of the offence whilst on parole aggravated the offending.  In respect of the accessory after the fact offence, Fullerton J imposed a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years.  
42The Crown referred to the sentence imposed on Postlewaight as indicating first that the sentence imposed on the applicant was not beyond the range of the exercise of a proper sentencing discretion.  The Crown also submitted that there was an aggravating element in the applicant's offending, namely the burning of the car, that was not present in Postlewaight's offending.  
43However, there were aggravating factors in Postlewaight's offending in which the applicant did not participate.  In particular, Postlewaight provided the use of the boat that was used to convey the body for disposal into deep waters.  He also provided the truck that towed the boat.  Subsequently, upon learning of Christiansen's arrest, he sought to hide or secrete the boat away by towing it to a rural property owned by his de facto partner.
44Postlewaight was sentenced after her Honour had sentenced the applicant.  In her remarks on sentence on Postlewaight's sentencing, Fullerton J considered that the objective criminality of Postlewaight's offending was of the same order as that of the applicant, but that there were no factors in Postlewaight's case to mitigate the objective seriousness of his conduct to any significant degree.  Her Honour stated that in the absence of mitigating factors, the sentence imposed on the applicant had little bearing on the sentence to be imposed upon Postlewaight.
45Postlewaight sought leave to appeal, including on the basis that the sentence imposed on the accessory after the fact offence was manifestly excessive:  Postlewaight v R [2011] NSWCCA 279.  Hislop J, with whom Whealy JA and Latham J agreed, reviewed a number of cases relied upon by Postlewaight to demonstrate that the sentence was outside a proper sentencing range for this offence and thus was manifestly excessive.  His Honour, at [23], referred to the principle that an appellate court did not interfere with the sentence imposed by a primary judge merely because the court had a different view of the sentence that ought to be imposed.  Sentencing error needs to be identified to warrant appellate interference:  see R v Tait (1979) 24 ALR 473;  46 FLR 386 at 388.  His Honour concluded that although the sentence imposed on Postlewaight was high, it was not so high as to demonstrate error.
46On this application for leave to appeal, the applicant argued that the objective criminality of his offending was less than that of Postlewaight's offending.  The essential difference between the conduct of the two offenders was Postlewaight's conduct in agreeing to provide the boat as compared to the applicant's presence when Christiansen burned the deceased's car.  In one respect, by providing the boat, Postlewaight's assistance involved a more active engagement in the disposal of the body than was the case of the applicant.  Accompanying Christiansen whilst he burned the motor vehicle was a passive activity of a different order from Postlewaight's conduct.  However, I do not consider that the criminality of each offender could thereby be differentiated. 
47Accordingly, I would reject ground 1 of the proposed notice of appeal. 
Ground 2:  the learned sentencing judge erred in structuring the sentences such that the total non-parole period imposed was in excess of 90 per cent of the total sentence imposed
48The question of how the Court should deal with ground 2 depends on the outcome of ground 3, which can be dealt with briefly.
Ground 3:  the learned sentencing judge erred by failing to impose a non-parole period in relation to the second count in accordance the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 45(1)
49The Crown drew to the attention of the Court and the applicant the fact that the trial judge erred in imposing a fixed term in respect of the drug offence.  A fixed term sentence is not available for an offence which carries a standard non-parole period:  see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 45(1) and Table to Division 1A of Part 4, in which the offence of accessory after the fact of murder is a listed offence.  Accordingly, ground 3 must be allowed.  This result in effect determines what the Court should do in respect of ground 2.  
50The Crown submitted that the Court should remit the matter to the sentencing judge so that a balance of term may be imposed:  Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 12(2).  On remitter, the sentencing judge would be entitled to reopen the proceedings pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 43 so as to impose a sentence in accordance with s 45:  see Hristovksi v R [2010] NSWCCA 129.
51The Crown submitted alternatively that if this Court considered that her Honour erred in respect of ground 2, it would be relevant to the Court's determination as to whether a less severe sentence was warranted in law:  Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(3).
52In my opinion, the matter should be remitted to the trial judge to attend to the proper sentencing of the applicant in respect of count 2, in accordance with s 45.  As it would be inappropriate to speculate upon the sentence her Honour might impose in that circumstance, I am of the opinion, therefore, that this Court should not deal with ground 2, as her Honour will, in any event, be required to exercise her discretion in respect of the appropriate ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term on the re-sentence.
53Accordingly, the orders I propose are as follows:
1.Grant leave to appeal against sentence;
2.Appeal allowed in part;
3.Remit the matter to the trial judge for re-sentence in respect of the offence charged in count 2:  supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, s 25(2).  
54HARRISON J:  I agree with Beazley JA.
55McCALLUM J:  I agree with Beazley JA.

2708208,Badans v R [2012] NSWCCA 97,"Judgment
1MEAGHER JA:  On 3 December 2010, following a trial before Syme DCJ which commenced on 29 November 2010, Luke Badans (the appellant) was found guilty of one count of sexual assault in contravention of s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900.  The count charged in the indictment was -
""On 22 August 2009 at Macquarie Fields in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without her consent and knowing she was not consenting.""
2On 24 June 2011 the trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of one year.  The applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years and there was a standard non-parole period of seven years.
3At the sentencing hearing the Crown required the attendance of Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist retained on behalf of the appellant, for cross-examination.  Following that hearing, the trial judge ordered, pursuant to s 177(7) of the Evidence Act 1995, that the Crown pay the costs of $1500 incurred by the appellant in relation to the attendance of Dr Nielssen.
4In this proceeding:
(1)the appellant appeals against his conviction pursuant to s 5(1)(a) and also seeks leave to appeal against that conviction pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Act).
(2)the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the sentence pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Act.
(3)the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the order for payment of Dr Nielssen's costs pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Act.
It is convenient to deal with the three appeals in the order in which they are referred to above.
The conviction appeal
5There are three grounds of appeal.  Grounds 1 and 2 are directed to statements made by the trial judge in her summing up.  Ground 3 is that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
6To address the arguments in support of these grounds, and in particular Ground 3, it is necessary to summarise the relevant evidence concerning the circumstances of the offence.  The issue for the jury was whether they accepted the complainant's evidence.  Her evidence was that she was asleep at the time the appellant commenced to have sexual intercourse with her.  The appellant's evidence was that the complainant was awake and that, by what she said and did, she invited him to have intercourse with her.  The resolution of that issue depended on whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant's evidence: Liberato v The Queen [1985] HCA 66; (1985) 159 CLR 507 at 515; R v Li [2003] NSWCCA 386; (2003) 140 A Crim R 288 at [72].  
The evidence at trial
7A party was held at the house of the complainant's friend, Kristy Hayes, at Macquarie Fields on Friday evening, 21 August 2009.  The complainant had stayed at the house on the previous evening and arrived at the party at about 6.30pm with Grant Lane who previously had been her boyfriend for about one month.  By 7.30pm at least eight people were at the house.  They included Ms Hayes' partner, Paul Buckton, and the appellant, who had been a work colleague of Mr Lane and Mr Buckton for about eight years or so.  The complainant had known the appellant for about one year as an acquaintance.  
8During the night those present listened to music, played pool and consumed alcohol.  The complainant said she had about eight to ten glasses of bourbon and coke and two ""jelly shots"" containing vodka.  The complainant took an amphetamine during the evening.  There was an issue as to where those drugs came from.  The complainant said that whilst she was having a cigarette at the back of the house with Mr Lane, Mr Buckton and the appellant, she was offered an amphetamine.  Ms Hayes' evidence was that during the evening the complainant called her into her bedroom and showed her a bag containing a substance which she understood was a form of 'speed'.  Ms Hayes said that the complainant offered her and that she took some of that substance which did not have any effect on her.  The complainant denied that this had occurred.  The complainant said that the drug she took did not affect her.  Ms Hayes' evidence was that the complainant was ""jumpy"" and ""more happy go lucky"" than usual.
9Mr Lane said that during the evening he had a lengthy conversation with the complainant on the back balcony of the house.  The complainant could not recall that occurring.  In the early hours of the morning Mr Lane went to his car which was parked in the driveway, at the rear of the house.  The complainant joined him a short time later.  They talked about their break-up, how they missed each other and agreed that they both wanted to resume their relationship again.  The complainant and Mr Lane gave evidence to this effect.  After an hour or so in the car, the complainant returned to the house to use the toilet.  After she had done so, those in the house teased her about what she and Mr Lane had been up to in the car.  Eventually, particularly at the urging of Mr Buckton, she decided not to go back to the car.  She remained in the lounge room for about 15 minutes and then went to Ms Hayes' bedroom to sleep.  At that time the appellant, Mr Buckton, Ms Hayes and two others remained in the lounge room talking.  The complainant described her condition by this time as being ""pretty drunk"".  In the bedroom, she changed into a black T-shirt and a pair of boxer shorts.  She was also wearing underpants and a sanitary pad as she had her period.
10The complainant left the door to the bedroom open and the bedroom light was off.  She said she fell asleep immediately.  The next thing she recalled was waking up with the appellant on top of her and having sex with her.  She was lying on her back, legs open and her knees were bent.  He was moving up and down with his penis in her vagina.  She said that as soon as she opened her eyes she saw it was the appellant.  Having recognised him she just froze and lay there.  She said she was in shock.  When the appellant finished he got up, pulled his pants up and jumped off the bed.  He looked at her and said ""Stay there, shut up"" and walked out.  She then pulled up her underpants and boxer shorts and pulled the bed covers up.  She saw the appellant's rolling tobacco on the bed, picked it up and threw it onto the floor.  As she lay there she then started to cry.  A couple of minutes later she heard the hall door open and someone jumped on her.  She saw it was the appellant.  He asked where his rolling tobacco was.  She pointed to the ground.  He picked it up and said ""Be quiet.  Just be quiet.  I told them I tried to wake you up.  Be quiet.""  He again left the room.
11The complainant said she was crying and, shortly afterwards, opened the hall door and motioned to Ms Hayes to come into the bedroom.  She then told her that the appellant had raped her.  Ms Hayes' evidence was that the complainant said ""I thought it was Grant"", ""when I woke up he was on top of me"" and ""I opened my eyes and saw it was Luke"".  The complainant did not dispute that she said words to that effect.  Ms Hayes also described the complainant as being ""sort of a bit out of it"".  She waited with the complainant until she fell asleep.  The complainant woke up some time later on the Saturday morning.  
12There was an issue as to whether the complainant spoke to Mr Lane by telephone on the Saturday morning.  His evidence was that in a telephone conversation she described to him what had happened as follows:
""Luke came in during the night.  I thought it was you.""and""It wasn't until he finished that I realised it wasn't you.""
He also said that she told him that the appellant had grabbed her by the throat and told her to shut up.  The complainant denied that she had a telephone conversation with Mr Lane on that morning.  However, she accepted that she had a face to face conversation with him later in the afternoon in which she reported what had happened to her.  It will be necessary to consider later in these reasons the cross-examination of the complainant on this conversation.
13The appellant's evidence was that during the evening he consumed about 10 beers and that he was ""a little bit tipsy"" but not drunk.  He described the complainant as ""quite intoxicated"" but not completely drunk or slurring her words or falling over.  When the complainant returned to the lounge room about 3.00am or so she sat there and talked with the appellant, Ms Hayes, Mr Buckton and two other girls.  Then she got up saying ""I'm going to bed"".  About 15 minutes later the appellant got up and said that he was ""going to go and wake her up"".  He agreed that to this point in time the complainant had not said anything which provided a basis for him to believe that she wanted to have, or would consent to, sexual intercourse with him.  The lights in the bedroom were off and the door was open.  He stood in the doorway and the complainant said ""Come and lay down next to me"".  He was unsure what she meant by this but lay down because he was starting to feel a bit tired.  She then started to rub her fingers over his body with a light scratch and said ""Aren't you going to do anything?""  He understood her to mean anything sexual and started to do the same thing back to her.  He scratched his fingers over her arm and belly.  She then said ""I want to fuck you"".  He then stood up and took off his pants.  She took her own pants off and they had intercourse until he ejaculated.  He did not use a condom as he did not carry them and did not go there expecting to have sex.  He then put his pants on and went back to the lounge room, realised he had left his 'smokes' in the bedroom and went back to retrieve them.  The complainant told him they were ""over there"".  He then picked them up and walked out.  
14In cross-examination the appellant accepted that he had ""quite a distinctive voice"".  His evidence was that when the complainant said to him ""Come and lay down"" she appeared to be looking at him, that she was lying on her back and her head was up on two pillows.  When they were lying on the bed and she said ""Aren't you going to do anything?"" she was also looking at him and he was looking at her but he maintained he could not really see her face as it was dark.  He also recalled in cross-examination that when he first stood in the doorway and said ""Come on wake up"", the complainant responded ""I'm still awake"".  He denied that he pulled the complainant's pants down.  She did not tell him that she had her period.  After he had put his pants on and she had put her pants on he said to her ""Thanks"" and she said ""Any time"".  The appellant denied that the complainant was asleep when he first commenced having intercourse with her.  He denied that he said to her before he left the room ""Stay there and shut up"" and that when he came back to retrieve his cigarettes he had said ""Be quiet.  Just be quiet.  I told them I tried to wake you up.  Be quiet.""  The appellant maintained that when he commenced having sex with the complainant he thought she was consenting.
15The evidence of Ms Hayes and one of the other witnesses present in the lounge room was that after the complainant had gone to bed, the appellant had said that he was going to go to the bedroom to ""wake her up"" and that he did so and returned five or six minutes later and said ""Oh man.  She's fucked"" meaning that she was 'out of it'.
Ground 1
16Ground 1 is that in her direction on the standard of proof, the trial judge erred in giving the taking of drugs at the party as an example of something which the Crown did not need to prove beyond reasonable doubt.  The appellant contends that there was an issue as to whether the complainant had taken drugs and was affected by them and that the trial judge's direction ""had the ability to take [that issue] away from the jury"" by suggesting that the jury need not be concerned with that issue.
17In its address the Crown had pointed out that the appellant may suggest that the complainant was too drunk or too affected by drugs to be a reliable witness or that her state of mind was such that she did not know what was going on.  The Crown submitted that notwithstanding that the complainant had consumed alcohol and an amount of a prohibited drug, she remembered clearly what the appellant had done to her.  The appellant's counsel in his closing address also referred to the complainant's drinking and drug taking as providing an explanation for the complainant behaving as the appellant's evidence indicated she had.
18The relevant part of the summing up was as follows:
""The burden of proof of guilt of the accused is placed on the Crown.  The onus rests upon the Crown with respect to every element of the charge.  There is no onus of proof on the accused at all.  It is not for the accused to prove his innocence.  But it is for the Crown to prove his guilt and to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  ...
The Crown does not, however, have to prove every single fact in the case to that standard.  For example in the context of this case, the Crown does not have to prove if there were drugs at the party or if there were, who took them or who brought them to the party.  In the context of this case, how the complainant got to the party, proof to that standard is not required.  These are small or large conflicts in the evidence that you may take into account in other ways, but the Crown case does not depend upon them being proven to that higher criminal standard.  The onus which rests upon the Crown is to prove the elements of the charges beyond reasonable doubt.""  (emphasis added)(Tcpt 2/12/10, p 5)
19At the conclusion of the summing up, it was suggested by counsel for the appellant that what had been said might indicate that there was an issue as to whether a drug was taken by the complainant whereas there was no real issue because her evidence was that she had taken an amphetamine.  The trial judge responded that she was only addressing ""the standard of proof"" and that she did not propose to amend the direction.  Counsel for the appellant ""accepted"" that as the position and did not press for any amendment to the summing up.  In my view, he was correct not to do so.  
20The part of the summing up extracted above makes clear that not all conflicts arising on the evidence concerned matters which were relevant or required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  It also made clear that the elements of the charges had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Those elements were identified later in the summing up.  When referring to the evidence as to drug taking, the trial judge did not suggest that there was no evidence as to drug taking or as to its effect upon the complainant or that the jury could not take evidence as to those matters into account when considering whether the elements of the charges had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Later in her summing up, when referring to the appellant's submissions as to why his evidence should be accepted, the trial judge reminded the jury:
""The accused's counsel on the other hand, refers to drugs, alcohol and desire.  These are the factual matrix in which you must weigh the evidence.  These are matters for you members of the jury.""  (emphasis added)(Tcpt 2/12/10, p 13
21For these reasons ground 1 is not made out.  Because the appellant's counsel did not require any specific direction or amendment to the summing up which squarely addressed the subject matter of this ground, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.  This is not a case in which the leave required by that rule should be granted.
Ground 2
22Ground 2 is that the trial judge erred:
(a) in not correcting the Crown proposition that because counsel for the appellant did not state that the complainant had sex with the appellant by mistake, it was not available for the jury to consider, that the victim had sex with the appellant because she thought he was Mr Lane, and
(b) when directing the jury as to how to deal with the uncontested Crown evidence that the complainant said to Mr Lane:
""Luke came in during the night.  I thought it was you.  It wasn't til he finished that I realised it wasn't you.""
Ground 2(a)
23Ground 2(a) can be dealt with shortly.  The part of the Crown's address said to include the ""Crown proposition"" referred to above was in the following terms:
""I don't know if my friend is going to suggest that [the complainant] thought it was Grant not the accused coming into the room and that she proceeded to have consensual intercourse, consensual sexual intercourse under that mistaken belief.  That certainly wasn't put to [the complainant] so she didn't have a chance to respond to that.  But if my friend does suggest that, then you only need to think about it for a moment to realise how implausible it is.  The accused comes into the room.  [The complainant] thinks it's Grant.  They have a conversation.  [The complainant] thinks it's Grant despite the distinctive sound of the accused's voice.  [The complainant] invites the accused onto the bed and he does so.  [The complainant] still thinks it's Grant.  The accused rubs his hand over her body.  She still thinks it's Grant.  She does the same to him.  Still things it's Grant.  They take off their pants.  She still thinks it's Grant.  They kiss.  She plays with his penis, engaging in sexual intercourse, they kiss.  She still thinks it's Grant.  Members of the jury it is not believable.  It is not even remotely plausible.  If the accused's version of events is true Ruth had ample opportunity to see who had come into the room.  And there is simply no room for mistake.  The accused had no trouble recognising the person in the room as [the complainant] so he says.  And [the complainant] would not have had any difficulty knowing it was the accused if she were awake and if those things had happened.""  (emphasis added)(Tcpt 1/12/10, p 7)
24The premise upon which this ground is based is not made out.  The Crown did not submit that because counsel for the appellant had not put to the complainant in cross-examination that she had sex with the appellant by mistake, it was not open to the jury to consider that this may have been what had occurred.  The Crown was entitled to point out that the complainant had not been cross-examined on this hypothesis: MWJ v The Queen [2005] HCA 74; (2005) 80 ALJR 329 at [19].  The remainder of the Crown submission assumed that the matter was one for the jury to consider and addressed the implausibility of the suggestion that the complainant had been mistaken.  There was no proposition put which required correction.  For these reasons ground 2(a) is not made out.
Ground 2(b)
25The trial judge's direction to the jury concerning Mr Lane's evidence as to what the complainant reported had happened was as follows:
""... The Crown case clearly is that [the complainant] was asleep when the sexual intercourse occurred.  The Crown case is that she woke up when sexual intercourse was already underway.  As such, if you accept this, according to my directions, she was not in a position to consent.  ...""(Tcpt 2/12/10, p 8)
""In this case, as I have said, the issue is that of consent.  However, there has been an unavoidable issue raised as to the question of knowledge, that I should deal with now, and that [is] the issue raised by Mr Crown in his address to you and by Mr Jones in cross-examination, and that is the issue of whether the complainant consented to sexual activity perhaps believing that she was consenting to sexual activity with Grant Lane.  Mr Crown said to you that Mr Jones did not put such a proposition to [the complainant].  He said that to you in his address.  Therefore she, the complainant, did not have the opportunity to comment on it.  That is true.  Mr Jones did put to [the complainant] the statement Mr Grant Lane made to police in his statement to police."" (Tcpt 2/12/10, pp 9-10)
26The reference to the ""issue raised by Mr Crown"" is to the Crown submission extracted in [23] above.  The summing up then made reference to Mr Lane's evidence and to the complainant's evidence in cross-examination.  The former evidence is set out in [12] above.  The complainant gave the following evidence in cross-examination concerning her conversation with Mr Lane:
""Q. The only reason I ask you that - I'll again be fair again - at paragraph 11, Mr Lane says - and he prefaces this by paragraph 10.  He says he thought initially things occurred at about 10am.  Then he says,""When I asked this, Luke wouldn't look at me, and I knew him well enough to say that he's lying to me.  I didn't say anything else to Luke, as I wanted to find out what happened.  When I got to Newcastle, which is probably about 40 minutes later, 10.40am, I called [the complainant] on her mobile phone.  I spoke to [the complainant] and asked her what happened.  [She] said 'Luke came in during the night.  I thought it was you.  It wasn't until he finished that I realised it wasn't you.'""A. That's wrong.Q. You say, again, that what Mr Lane has conveyed in his statement -A. I can verify that for you, if you like.Q. You say, again, what Mr Lane has conveyed to you in his statement is factually incorrect.  That's right?A. Yes, some of it's incorrect.  The way that he's put it across is incorrect.Q. You say you had no conversation at all with Mr Lane.  That's your case isn't it?A. Yes.  I remember saying that to him in the afternoon, face to face.Q. But it was not --A. But I do not remember saying that over the phone to him.Q. You now preface it by not so much you didn't have the conversation, but you can't remember it?A. I can't remember that conversation on the telephone, no.""  (emphasis added)(Tcpt 29/11/10, p 38)
The cross-examiner then directed the complainant to what she had said to Ms Hayes:
""Q. [Ms Hayes] said, ""I cannot recall exactly what order [the complainant] told me what happened, but she was really upset.  But I do remember her saying, 'I thought it was Grant'"".A. Before I opened my eyes and realised what was happening, I thought I was in the back seat with Grant still.  I opened my eyes, and it hit me where I was and what was going on.Q. So whilst you were lying in bed, you weren't asleep.  You thought you were in the back seat of the car with Grant. Is that right?A. I was waking up from my sleep.  I was asleep and I was waking up, and that was the first thing that came to mind before I even opened my eyes.  I just remembered being in the car with Grant.  I opened my eyes, and then I realised where I was.Q. I'm just trying to get this right because I might have misheard you.  As I understood it, you first said to me you thought you were in the car with Grant, and then you woke up.A. Well, as I was - you know, when you wake up, and when you haven't opened your eyes and you're still coming to terms, and I was very drunk and I was thinking I'm in the car with Grant, and then I've opened my eyes, and it's hit me: I'm in Kristy's room in Kristy's bed and then, my God, Luke's on top of me.""  (emphasis added)(Tcpt 29/11/10, p 39)
27The summing up of the trial continued:
""Now I raise that for you only because counsel has raised that issue and there was cross-examination on it and I think I'm aware from your previous jury note, somebody had thought of it beforehand.
As I said to you in relation to that matter, it is the duty of defence counsel to put to witnesses any instructions they have that contradict the evidence that has been given.  That's counsel's duty.  It was the case of the accused [the complainant] was awake and consenting to sex.  It is not the accused's case that such consent was given under some sort of misapprehension by [the complainant] at least as far as he was aware of.  That is, as far as the accused was aware of.  That is a matter that Mr Grant Lane says was conveyed to him by [the complainant].  But when it was put to [the complainant] she disagreed with that portion of Mr Lane's statement.  You may think the disagreement is unclear or ambiguous or whether it is in reference to the statement itself, or whether it is in reference to a face to face meeting or a telephone conversation.  These are matters for you members of the jury, as judges of the fact.""  (emphasis added)(Tcpt 2/12/10, p 11)
28The appellant submits that the trial judge's comments commencing with the reference to the ""duty of defence counsel"" involved error in two respects.  First, it is said that they suggested that the appellant's counsel had a duty to put to the complainant that she had invited the appellant onto the bed and engaged in sexual activity because she mistakenly thought he was Mr Lane.  It is also said that at the same time those comments implied, in the absence of that having occurred, that the jury need not address that scenario.  Secondly, it is said that in describing the complainant as having ""disagreed with that portion of Mr Lane's statement"" the trial judge's comments did not accurately and fairly summarise the complainant's evidence.  In my view, the trial judge's summing up did not involve either of these errors.
29As to the first asserted error:  The trial judge did not in terms direct the jury that the appellant's counsel had a duty to put to the complainant that she may have been under a misapprehension as to the appellant's identity.  The duty was described in general terms as being to put to relevant witnesses ""any instructions"" that counsel had which contradicted the evidence given.  Although the duty was not described as limited to instructions given by the accused, the immediately following reference to it not being the accused's case that the complainant was under any misapprehension ""at least as far as he was aware"" made it sufficiently clear that the instructions to which the duty was directed were instructions of the accused.  That reference explained why the duty did not apply in this case.  It also left open the possibility that the complainant was under a misapprehension as to the appellant's identity although not to the appellant's knowledge.  That possibility was then referred to as the matter Mr Lane said ""was conveyed to him"".
30The trial judge's reference at the start of this passage to what she had said ""in relation to that matter"" was to her response, two days earlier, to a note from the jury inquiring as to the origin of a statement put by the appellant's counsel to the complainant in cross-examination.  The trial judge's response to that question had included the following:
""Now, it's the defence counsel's job and indeed duty to take instructions and it is defence counsel's duty to put the instructions that he has from the accused person to the complainant by way of cross-examination."" (Tcpt 30/11/10, p 67)
What was subsequently said to the jury during the summing up was to the same effect.
31The summing up did not say that in the absence of any such cross-examination of the complainant, it was not open to the jury to find that the complainant was under some sort of misapprehension and no such submission was made by the Crown.  The trial judge's direction acknowledges that the possibility of misapprehension was raised by Mr Lane's evidence as to what he had been told.  The trial judge recorded that the complainant had disagreed with that part of Mr Lane's evidence and left the matter to the jury.
32As to the second asserted error:  The trial judge was correct to observe that the complainant had expressed disagreement with Mr Lane's statement: see [26] above.  She said in response to the passages read from Mr Lane's statement ""that's wrong"" and that some of what Mr Lane's statement conveyed was ""incorrect"".  The trial judge's comment that the complainant had ""disagreed"" drew attention to this evidence.  She then pointed out that the jury may think that what the complainant was disagreeing with, or saying was not correct, was ""unclear or ambiguous"" or uncertain.  That was a correct observation.  The complainant could be understood to have been referring to the content of Mr Lane's statement or to the fact of the telephone conversation.  Those matters of uncertainty in the evidence were left to the jury.  The summing up did not unfairly or materially misstate the evidence which had been given.  For these reasons, ground 2(b) is not made out.
Ground 3
33Ground 3 is that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: s 5(1)(b) and s 6(1) of the Act.  The question this Court must address is ""whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"": M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25].  When addressing that question this Court must make an independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"": M v The Queen at 492-493.
34The test in M v The Queen requires attention to whether on the whole of the evidence there is a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt.  In circumstances where the court entertains such a doubt it also requires attention to whether it was nevertheless ""open to the jury"", acting reasonably, and with its advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence, to resolve that doubt and be satisfied as to the accused's guilt.  In M v The Queen at 494, the majority said:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.  It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.  That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced.  If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full disclosure for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.""
35Because the Crown case depended upon the acceptance of the evidence of the complainant, it is (and was for the jury) necessary to scrutinise that evidence with great care.  It was for that reason that a direction was given in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12.
36The complainant maintained that she was asleep and did not wake up until the appellant had commenced to have intercourse with her.  The appellant's evidence was that the complainant was awake at the time he entered the bedroom and engaged in activity including conversation which invited the events which followed.  It was suggested that an explanation for the complainant having behaved as described by the appellant was that she was mistaken as to his identity. 
37The appellant relies on two matters as calling into question the reliability and truthfulness of the complainant's evidence.  The first is the evidence of Mr Lane and Ms Hayes as to what the complainant reported happened to her.  It is said that this evidence was consistent with the appellant's evidence that she had been awake, or at least alert enough to know she was having sex, although mistaken as to the identity of her partner.  The second is that the complainant gave evidence which in a number of respects was inconsistent with or contrary to the evidence of other Crown witnesses.  
38When addressing this ground it is also necessary to consider whether there are any other matters which could give rise to a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant's evidence.  They include whether the complainant may have been so affected by drugs or alcohol or both as to be an unreliable witness to what happened during the evening, whether any conduct of the complainant was inconsistent with her version of events and whether the complainant's version of events was improbable in any respect.  It is also necessary to consider whether the appellant's evidence was such as to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  It is convenient first to deal with the arguments made by the appellant and then to consider these other matters.
39Ms Hayes' evidence is summarised in [11] above and the complainant's evidence is extracted in [26] above.  There is no inconsistency between what Ms Hayes recalled the complainant telling her and the complainant's version of what happened.  The complainant told Ms Hayes that when she woke up ""he was on top of me"".
40Mr Lane's evidence is set out in [12] above.  It could be understood as the  complainant reporting that she thought the appellant was Mr Lane when he ""came in during the night"" and that it was not until ""he finished"" that she realised it was not him.  When that version of events was put to the complainant she said that it was ""wrong"" and ""incorrect""; meaning that was not how events happened or that was not as she reported the events to Mr Lane or, perhaps, both.  Mr Lane's evidence could also be understood as the complainant reporting that the appellant came into the room, at some time she thought he was Mr Lane and that it was not until he ""finished"" that she realised he was not Mr Lane.  Because Mr Lane's evidence was hearsay as to what happened in the bedroom and also could be understood in either of these ways, there was no necessary or irreconcilable inconsistency between it and the truthfulness of the complainant's evidence.  The jury could regard her evidence as not being inconsistent with what she had told, or was likely to have told, Mr Lane.  The jury could consider the explanation for any inconsistency to be a lack of precision in her reporting of what had happened or in his recollection of what he had been told or a combination of both.  Mr Lane's evidence does not give rise to a doubt as to the truthfulness of the complainant's evidence which the jury could not reasonably have resolved in one of these ways.
41The appellant refers to a number of respects in which the complainant's evidence is said to have been inconsistent with or contrary to the evidence of other Crown witnesses.  As the analysis which follows shows, none of those inconsistencies was with respect to the complainant's evidence of what happened in the bedroom or such as to cast doubt on the veracity of that evidence.  The first concerns whether Mr Buckton had driven the complainant to Ms Hayes' house on the afternoon of the day before the party (20 August 2009) as the complainant said in evidence.  Mr Buckton said in his statement that he first saw the complainant at the party.  In cross-examination he said that although he could not recall driving her to the party, he may have subsequently forgotten that he had.  There is no necessary inconsistency in this evidence because it was not sufficiently clear that Mr Buckton's evidence was addressing the day of the party rather than the day before or both.  More significantly, any inconsistency was as to a matter of detail on the very periphery of the critical matters in issue.  The second concerns who supplied the complainant with the amphetamine she admitted taking.  The complainant said the drugs were supplied by one of the men present.  Ms Hayes said that the complainant supplied her with drugs.  Although there remained this conflict in the evidence, the fact that the complainant may not have told the truth as to the source of the amphetamine she took does not cast any significant doubt on her evidence as to what happened later in the evening.  There were likely to be reasons why she may not have wanted to tell the truth as to whether she had brought drugs to the party.  This aspect of the evidence did not necessarily call into question her reliability as a witness of truth.
42The third concerns what the complainant and Mr Lane had spoken about on the ""back balcony"" before going to his car.  The complainant said she could not remember spending an hour or so on the balcony talking to Mr Lane.  To the extent that she denied anything about the conversation on the balcony, it was that she had spoken to Mr Lane about ""getting back together"".  Her recollection was that this was discussed in his car.  Mr Lane's evidence was that this was discussed on both occasions.  Again, this was an inconsistency in the evidence but not one which related to the critical events in the bedroom or raised doubts as to her credibility.  The fourth concerns whether the complainant had told the doctor who examined her on the evening of 21 August that she had taken a ""tiny tablet of speed"", as he recorded in his note, or ""some speed"" as she maintained in evidence.  This is an immaterial difference not relevant to the complainant's reliability as a witness.  The final inconsistency relied upon concerns whether the complainant was ""seeing"" Mr Lane in January 2009, as she said, or July or August 2009, as he said.  Again, this inconsistency was as to a minor detail unrelated to the critical matters in issue.
43There was one matter in relation to which the complainant accepted in cross-examination that she had not been truthful.  In her first statement to the Police she did not refer to Mr Buckton's presence at the party.  In cross-examination she agreed that this part of her statement was not correct and said that she had been asked by Ms Hayes to leave him out of her statement because he was subject to an apprehended violence order which may have been breached by his presence at the party.  Her explanation for why she made that false statement was plausible and provided a reasonable basis for not treating this aspect of her evidence as raising questions as to her reliability as a truthful witness.
44Another question which arose on the evidence was whether the complainant was too drunk or too affected by drugs to be a reliable witness.  Ms Hayes' evidence concerning the complainant's condition was that she had ""a fair bit to drink"" and that she was ""very happy"", ""very lively"" and ""more happy go lucky"" than usual and Ms Hayes attributed her behaviour to drug taking.  Ms Hayes also said that the complainant was not slurring her words, falling over things or at the stage where she was ""the typical sort of drunk"".  Mr Lane had lengthy conversations with the complainant, first on the back balcony, and later in his car.  His evidence as to her condition at the time they were talking on the back balcony was that she was ""fine"".  The appellant's evidence was that when the complainant returned to the lounge room before going to the bedroom, she sat down and he had ""a good conversation"" with her before she went to bed.  Whilst the complainant conceded that she was ""pretty drunk"" at the time she went to bed and one of the others present described her as ""drunk"", the evidence does not suggest that she was so drunk or affected by drugs as to be unable to reliably recall what happened after she went into the bedroom and particularly as to how she woke up.
45There is nothing in the complainant's conduct immediately after the events in the bedroom which gives rise to any doubt as to the cogency or reliability of her version of events.  Ms Hayes described her as ""hysterical"" and ""sobbing uncontrollably"".  Her complaint to Ms Hayes and the story which she gave to the doctor who medically examined her at Liverpool Hospital were consistent with her evidence to the jury.  The doctor's history recorded that he was told:
""At around 4.00am she went to bed in a bedroom at Kristy's house after changing into her pyjamas (boxer shorts and top).  She woke up when she felt her body being shaken and saw Luke on top of her and her shorts and undies around her left ankle.  She felt Luke inside her.  He jumped off when she saw him.  She started to cry but he told her to ""Shut up - I told them I came to wake you up"".""
46If the appellant's version of events was correct, there was no real room for any mistake on the part of the complainant as to his identity.  He had a distinctive voice and, at the door, said ""Come on wake up"" to which the complainant responded ""I'm still awake"".  The complainant was lying on her back and her head was on two pillows.  They then lay together and kissed before removing their pants.  If the complainant had been awake and not mistaken as to the appellant's identity she must have decided to have sexual intercourse with the appellant notwithstanding that she had agreed with Mr Lane to resume their relationship, notwithstanding that the appellant was only an acquaintance and not someone in whom she had any sexual interest and notwithstanding that she had her period.  None of these matters make it unlikely that the complainant's version of events occurred.  
47Finally, it is necessary to address the appellant's evidence.  He maintained his version of events under cross-examination.  A reading of the transcript suggests that the appellant was straightforward and not evasive in his answers.  He agreed that he was at first confused and unsure as to the complainant's invitation to ""fuck me"" which on his version of events occurred.  In many respects his conduct after the event was not consistent with his believing that he had done anything wrong.  After he left the bedroom he returned to the lounge room and remained there for some time talking to the others present.  At one stage he took a glass of water to the complainant and Ms Hayes while they were in the hallway.  He had earlier gone back to get his cigarettes from the bedroom.  Nevertheless, there was nothing in that version of events which was so cogent or compelling that it could not be put aside in the face of the complainant's evidence.  There was also at least one aspect of the appellant's evidence which was improbable.  His evidence was that he saw and could recognise the complainant's face from the doorway but could not see whether her eyes were open.  His evidence also was that he could not see her face when he was lying on the bed with her and they were kissing and when he was on top of her either because he had his eyes shut or his head on a pillow or both.  Any other evidence would have allowed of the possibility that he could have seen the complainant's face and that she was asleep.  If the complainant was not asleep the question arose as to why she did not see and recognise the appellant and say something before the sexual intercourse commenced.  These questions had to be weighed by the jury when assessing the truthfulness of the appellant's evidence.
48These matters, considered separately and together, do not give rise in my mind to a doubt as to the appellant's guilt which could not have been resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence.  The jury was in the best position to assess the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence of the complainant's and appellant.  This was so notwithstanding that the complainant's evidence was given remotely by closed circuit television.  Any possible discrepancies and inconsistencies between that evidence and the evidence of Mr Lane was explained by the complainant in cross-examination in a way which was plausible, consistent with her subsequent behaviour and complaint and consistent with her subsequent report to the hospital doctor.  There was also no respect in which her version of events was inherently improbable.
49For these reasons there is no basis to warrant this Court interfering with the jury's verdict on the ground that it is unreasonable or not supported by the evidence.  Accordingly, ground 3 is not made out.
The sentencing appeal
50The offence charged is one to which Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) applies.  The grounds of appeal and the Crown's written argument were formulated before the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  Muldrock rejected a construction of s 54B(2) of that Act as mandating the specification of a standard non-parole period for offences within the mid-range of objective seriousness: Muldrock at [24], [25].  In doing so it rejected a two-stage approach to sentencing for such offences which first assesses whether the offence falls in that middle range by reference to an hypothesised offence answering that description and, if it does, inquires whether there are matters justifying a longer or shorter non-parole period: Muldrock at [25], [28].  To the extent that this Court upheld such an approach in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, that decision must be regarded as wrong.
51Instead, the sentencing court is to take the approach described by McHugh JA in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]; Muldrock at [26].  That approach is to identify all the factors relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, to discuss their significance and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all of those factors.  That decision obviously must be made in the light of the purposes for imposing a sentence: see s 3A of the Sentencing Act; Muldrock at [20].
52The factors which the sentencing court is required to take into account in relation to a Div 1A offence are those described or referred to in s 21A as well as the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period for the offence: Muldrock at [27]; Way at [103].  They include the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in ss 21A(2) and (3) as well as ""any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence"".  The closing words of s 21A(1) also make clear that the factors specifically listed are not intended to be exhaustive of the matters which may properly be taken into account: Muldrock at [19]; Way at [57], [104].  
53When taking into account the standard non-parole period it is necessary to note that it represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders and therefore determined ""wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"": Muldrock at [27], [31].  Such an assessment would not take account of circumstances personal to the offender even if they were causally related to the commission of the offence: cf Way at [86], [88], [99]; Muldrock at [22].  The maximum sentence, as a yardstick or guideline, directs attention to the relative seriousness of the offence and is a factor to be taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors when making the judgment as to the appropriate sentence: Markarian at [31]; Muldrock at [31]; Way at [51], [53].  It remains an essential part of the sentencing process to consider the objective gravity of the offending: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [18]-[19]; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [46]-[47].
Grounds 1, 2 and 3
54It is not surprising then, that the Crown's arguments in respect of grounds 1, 2 and 3 focus on an approach which would require an evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence, taking into account the characteristics of the offender having some causal connection with its commission, against an hypothesised offence that falls in the middle range of objective seriousness assessed on the same basis.  In support of ground 1 it was submitted that the trial judge erred when assessing where the offence fell in the range of objective seriousness in not concluding that it was ""in the mid-range of offending"" which in this context was a reference to the middle of the range of objective seriousness: see s 54A(2).  Muldrock holds that the sentencing judge is not required to undertake that exercise: Muldrock at [25].  Accordingly the trial judge was not in error in failing to do so or in failing to conclude that the offence was in the ""mid-range of offending"".  Ground 1 is rejected.
55In support of grounds 2 and 3, specific reference was made by the Crown to the decision of this Court in R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186 at [77], where it was said in relation to Div 1A offences that it is necessary to specify where the offence lies on the range of objective seriousness.  It was submitted that the trial judge failed to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence (ground 2) and that the trial judge failed to have regard to the standard non-parole period of seven years in imposing a non-parole period of one year (ground 3).  The premise underlying each of these grounds is that the trial judge was required to assess and classify the objective seriousness of the offence relative to the ""mid-range of objective seriousness of the offence"" and that s 54B(2) mandates the specification of a standard non-parole period for offences within the mid-range of objective seriousness.  Muldrock rejected an approach to sentencing which requires that assessment and treats s 54B(2) as having that effect.  For that reason grounds 2 and 3 are rejected.
Grounds 4 and 5
56The substantial argument made by the Crown is addressed to ground 5 and, although expressed in more general terms, to ground 4.  That argument is that the trial judge erred in finding and taking into account as a relevant factor that the appellant's intellectual disability contributed to the commission of the offence so as to reduce his moral culpability.  The Crown submits that by reason of the jury's verdict and the evidence given at the trial by the appellant, it was not open to the trial judge to find that ""the offender's intellectual functioning reduce(d) his moral culpability to some extent"" (ROS p 16) and that this made him an inappropriate medium for making an example to others (ROS p 15).  It also submits that such a finding should not, in any event, have led to any substantial diminution in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence or in the ultimate sentence imposed.  The former criticism must be rejected in the light of the decision in Muldrock.  The latter remains to be addressed, but also in the light of that decision.
57It is not controversial that the fact that an offender is suffering from a mental illness or intellectual disability may be taken into account in various ways in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  The relevant principles are summarised in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [177].  Those principles make clear that an offender's mental illness or intellectual disability may be taken into account notwithstanding that no causal connection has been established between it and the commission of the offence.  In Engert v R (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 Gleeson CJ said:
""... the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system.""
See also the discussion in R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [42]-[47] per Simpson J.  However, such a causal relationship must be established if the illness or disability is to be relied on as reducing the offender's moral culpability so as to militate against the need for denunciation by the sentence: R v Letteri (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 March 1992, unreported) per Badgery-Parker J; R v Fahda at [42]-[47]; Lauritsen v The Queen [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 22 WAR 442 at [48]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]-[24]; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]; DPP v De La Rosa at [177] (and specifically the first principle there summarised); Muldrock at [54], [55].  
58The trial judge made the following findings as to the appellant's intellectual disability and its consequences, based upon the evidence: He has an intellectual capacity at the lower 5% of the normal range for the population which places him at a degree of intellectual disability but does not classify him as intellectually disabled (ROS p 3); he is functionally illiterate and as a result of learning difficulties has suffered a degree of social rejection throughout his life so as to have a very low level of social functioning (ROS pp 3, 5); his understanding of consent is limited and his understanding of social situations is poor (ROS p 4); his intellectual disability causes shyness and social isolation (ROS p 15).  The Crown does not submit that any of these findings involved any error.
59The trial judge took account of the appellant's intellectual disability in a number of ways.  First, she found that his ""intellectual and social functions had some but not an overwhelming effect on the commission of the offence"" (ROS p 6) so as to reduce his moral culpability and the need for denunciation of the offence (ROS p 15).  Secondly, when addressing the need for general deterrence in the sentence, the trial judge found that the appellant's intellectual disability and very low level of social functioning made him an inappropriate medium to be made an example to others (ROS p 15): see Muldrock at [53].  Thirdly, the trial judge found that his intellectual and social functioning were more likely to improve outside the prison system so as to justify a reduced non-parole period (ROS pp 10, 11, 17).  Fourthly, she found that the appellant would be vulnerable to bullying behaviour in the prison system, and that his intellectual disability and limited social functioning would make it difficult for him to adjust to that system with the result that a custodial sentence was likely to weigh more heavily on him (ROS pp 10, 11, 12).  Finally, the trial judge found that his intellectual disability did not have the consequence that the appellant presented a level of danger to the community giving rise to considerations which might result in an increased sentence (ROS p 15): see Muldrock at [60].
60The Crown's submissions in relation to grounds 4 and 5 are addressed to the first and second of these ways in which the trial judge took account of the appellant's intellectual disability and social functioning in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  As I have noted above, it is only in respect of the first of those ways that there must be some causal relationship between the illness or disability and the commission of the offence.  Before addressing those submissions, it is necessary first to consider the evidence before the trial judge on the sentencing hearing and then to consider the relevant findings of the trial judge.
61Two psychiatric reports were tendered at the sentencing hearing.  The earlier in time was the report of Dr Nielssen, a qualified psychiatrist, dated 3 February 2011.  That report recorded that Dr Nielssen had read the ""Police Facts"" in relation to the charge.  That document set out the complainant's version of events including that she had been asleep at the time the appellant commenced to have intercourse with her.  Dr Nielssen's report also restated the appellant's version of events which he maintained notwithstanding that he had been found guilty.  
62Dr Nielssen diagnosed the appellant as having an intellectual disability and a substance abuse disorder which was in partial remission.  He summarised his opinion in the following terms:
""Mr Badans' overall level of intellectual function was estimated to be around the bottom of the normal range, as he had been able to work consistently since leaving school, he is reported to be reasonably numerate, and to have some aptitude for mechanical work. ...Mr Badans has been convicted of a sexual assault of a woman who was affected by a combination of alcohol and amphetamine.  From the history provided, it seems Mr Badans had fairly limited experience of relationships at that time.  He had also consumed a large quantity of alcohol.  The combination of emotional immaturity, low intelligence and the effects of alcohol is likely to have affected Mr Badans' perception of the events and also his capacity to recognise that [the complainant] was not consenting, or was not in a fit state to give consent to sexual intercourse.
Mr Badans does not have a history of other forms of disturbed conduct, or any previous criminal convictions.  He has a history of consistent employment despite his intellectual difficulties.  There is also a history of good a response to counselling for cannabis use.  People with intellectual disabilities and brain injuries are often more susceptible to the effects of alcohol, and he should consider further counselling regarding his use of alcohol.
Mr Badans was thought to carry a low risk of re-offending.  He would be a vulnerable prisoner if he were given a custodial sentence, and if that were considered necessary, he should be referred to the intellectual disability service within the prison system for appropriate placement.""  (emphasis added)
63The later report was a Psychological Pre Sentence Assessment of Dr Yusef, a forensic psychologist of Forensic Psychology Services within Corrective Services NSW and dated 9 May 2011.  That report refers to the ""Police Facts"" and to the complainant having ""awoken"" with the appellant on top of her.  It also recites the appellant's version of events as described to the author in an interview conducted on the date of the report.  In relation to that interview the author notes:
""6.3 During the interview, he did not demonstrate a firm understanding on the meaning of consent and did not appear to understand that the victim was vulnerable due to her substance use.  Mr Badans displayed little insight into the causes of his behaviour and was not able to identify alcohol as a potential contributor.""  (emphasis added)
64The author's conclusions included the following:
""11.2.1 ... While Mr Badans does not deny having sexual intercourse with the victim, he strongly denied that he had forced the victim to have sex, saying that 'she was consenting, she led me into the room ... she was touching me'.  Mr Badans appears to have misconstrued the victim's behaviour as being sexually inviting, and he was unable to recognise that the victim may have been vulnerable given her level of intoxication both from alcohol and amphetamines.
11.2.2 Mr Badans also appeared to be emotionally immature, and this may have been a contributor to his offending behaviour.  Mr Badans has had very limited interpersonal relationships and coupled with low self-esteem, any interest shown by the victim in Mr Badans (ie via conversation, etc), may have been misunderstood, on his behalf, as sexual interest....11.2.3 Therefore, in concurrence with Dr Nielssen's psychiatric report, it appears that Mr Badans' intellectual ability is linked to his offending behaviour in that he appears to have deficits in interacting with others and a lack of understanding regarding consent.  His misinterpretation of the victim's behaviour as being sexually inviting may have been amplified by a series of factors including his own interest in the victim, his cognitive ability and his alcohol consumption which inhibited his self regulation and self control.  These factors, amalgamated, appear to have been a catalyst for Mr Badans' offending behaviour.""  (emphasis added)
65In the proceedings on sentence, the Crown cross-examined Dr Nielssen with particular reference to the fact that the jury's verdict involved an acceptance that the complainant was asleep and to the appellant's evidence that, before he entered the bedroom, he had no reason to believe that the complainant was sexually interested in him. 
66That cross-examination of Dr Nielssen included the following exchanges:
""Q. Assuming that the victim's version is the correct version, and that's what the jury found, are you suggesting in your report that Mr Badans' emotional immaturity or low intelligence may have affected his capacity for him to recognise that she was asleep?A. No I'm not suggesting that.Q. So given you're not suggesting that how it is that you can say that his 'emotional immaturity, low intelligence and the effects of alcohol' affected his capacity to recognise whether or not she was consenting?A. Well it seems at some stage she must have been roused from sleep and then the issue would have been a live one. ...Q. The facts of the case, based on the version accepted by the jury, the victim's version was that she was asleep, she woke up, she was in shock, she froze and that he continued to have sexual intercourse with her until he finished and then told her to stay there and shut up and then left the room.  Assuming those are the facts of the case how can it be said that there's any nexus at all between his low intelligence and emotional immaturity and his ability to understand whether or not she was in a fit state to consent?A. Well I think it's kind of obvious you know that, whether or not he was able to - you know that he could realise that she may not have wished to proceed with sexual intercourse - Her Honour:  Doctor is it a matter of his perception that you're talking about rather than what somebody else or a jury might have thought?A. Well that was the point of making the opinion, that his capacity to understand those issues is less than other persons.Q. And perhaps a capacity to understand that somebody who's asleep might not be in a position to consent?A. That was also part of the end of the paragraph....Counsel:  Q. Did you, during the interview, ask Mr Badans whether or not he knew that a sleeping woman is a person who is not able or who is unlikely to be willing to consent to sexual intercourse?A. I can't remember if I asked that specifically....Q. Dr Nielssen, Mr Badans in his evidence in the trial, said that he agreed with the proposition I put to him that he had no reason to believe that [the complainant] was sexually interested in him before he went into the room and did what he did.  Assuming he was telling the truth about that, does it change your opinion?A. No, not in terms of what I think is wrong with him.Q. Doesn't that suggest that he knew full well that she wasn't a person who was ...Her Honour: Mr Cristofi, you keep on doing this, you've asked the doctor a question, he has given you an answer and you are becoming argumentative, it's unseemly.""  (emphasis added)
67Although the Crown says that the trial judge, by this last exchange effectively put an end to the cross-examination of Dr Nielssen, it does not submit that there was any denial of procedural fairness or other error involved in that exchange.  It rightly points out if there are disputes as to fact or opinion evidence relied upon before the sentencing court, those disputes should be resolved by the accusatorial process and upon the evidence before the court which, if necessary, will include cross-examination: R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at [21]; O'Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42 at [26]; Reberger v R [2011] NSWCCA 132 at [48].  If counsel considers that cross-examination or further cross-examination is necessary to test properly evidence which is disputed, he or she should seek to do so and not be put off doing so by statements such as those made by the trial judge in this case.  If counsel is stopped by the trial judge from doing so, a question may later arise as to whether there was a denial of procedural fairness in what occurred.  However, that is not this case.
68When finding facts relevant to sentencing, the trial judge was entitled to form her own view as to the facts provided that her view was consistent with the jury's verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 378; Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14], [169].  That is so even if the view of the facts which the trial judge was obliged to take by the jury's verdict is different from that which she would have taken unconstrained by the verdict. The Crown submits that the verdict is only consistent with the jury having found that the complainant was asleep when the appellant commenced to have sexual intercourse with her and that by their verdict the jury must be taken to have rejected the appellant's evidence that the complainant was awake when he entered the room and thereafter engaged in conversation with him whilst she was awake.  Whilst all of that may be accepted, the jury's verdict is consistent with the appellant having laid on the bed with the complainant and having had close physical contact with her before they commenced to have intercourse and she was roused from her sleep.  At some stage in that process and before she became conscious of where she was and with whom, the complainant thought she was in the back of Mr Lane's car with him.  That evidence carries with it the likelihood that she said or did something in her sleep which from the appellant's perspective with his limited intellectual and social functioning led him to think that she was interested in having sex with him.
69The relevant finding of the trial judge was that the appellant's ""intellectual and social functions had some but not an overwhelming effect on the commission of the offence"" (ROS p 6).  She rejected the suggestion that such a finding would be inconsistent with the jury's verdict (ROS p 5).  She did so on the basis of her earlier finding that the appellant's ""understanding of consent is so limited and his understanding of social situations is so poor that, looking at it from his point of view, there was a cognitive difficulty that he had in understanding the nature and degree of consent required"" (ROS pp 4-5).  That finding was directed to circumstances which included that the complainant was asleep when the appellant entered the bedroom and remained so when he first joined her on the bed.  It was a finding open to the trial judge on the evidence of Dr Nielssen.  He agreed that his observation as to the appellant's capacity to recognise whether someone was giving consent extended to someone who was apparently asleep: see [62] and [66] above.  The other psychiatric evidence, which was not tested, was consistent with that evidence.  It referred to the appellant being ""emotionally immature"", as having ""deficits in interacting with others"" and as having a lack of ""understanding regarding consent"": see [64] above. 
70The trial judge referred to the appellant's conduct after the event as indicating a ""very low level of social functioning"" (ROS p 5) and described the appellant's ""lack of cognitive understanding as to why [the complainant] was upset and as to what he should do about it"" as also indicative of this lack of understanding.  The trial judge's finding takes account of the probable sequence of events from when the appellant entered the bedroom whilst the complainant was asleep until she was roused from her sleep by the appellant.  It concludes that in that sequence of events the appellant's intellectual and social functioning had ""some but not an overwhelming effect"" on what he did.  In my view that finding was available on the evidence and not inconsistent with the jury's verdict.  For those reasons ground 4 is rejected.
71In support of ground 5, the Crown also argues that the trial judge's findings as to the appellant's intellectual disability reducing his moral culpability should not have resulted in the ultimate sentence imposed.  This argument does not take account of the other factors which the trial judge took into account.  In addition to those relating to his intellectual and social functioning, they included the appellant's prior good character and that he had no record of previous convictions (ROS p 9); the low risk of the appellant re-offending as assessed by the psychiatric evidence (ROS pp 9-10); and the appellant's lack of remorse explained by his intellectual disability and emotional immaturity (ROS p 9).  
72The Crown argues that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that the lack of remorse was of ""less significance"" in this case.  I do not agree.  Whilst remorse may be a major factor in determining whether an offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation, the circumstances of each case must be considered on their merits.  Here, the appellant's intellectual disability and social immaturity provided an explanation for his lack of remorse and the uncontested psychiatric evidence was that the risk of his re-offending was low and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good.  For these and the earlier reasons given in relation to ground 4, ground 5 is also rejected.
Ground 6
73Ground 6 is that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.  In Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 the High Court approved the following statement by this Court of the relevant principle in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562:
""An appellate court will only interfere if it is demonstrated that the sentencing judge fell into material error of law or fact.  Such error may appear in the reasons given by the sentencing judge, or the sentence itself may be manifestly excessive or inadequate, and thus disclose error.  However, the facts and circumstances of individual cases are often such that sentencing judges have a substantial discretion, and the appellant court does not intervene simply upon the basis that the members of that court would have exercised their discretion differently from the judge at first instance.""
74The Crown, relying on its submissions in relation to grounds 1 to 5, submits that the sentence ""bespeaks error"" when regard is had to the standard non-parole period.  That submission wrongly assumes that s 54B(2) mandates the specification of the standard non-parole period for offences within the mid-range of objective seriousness and that the standard non-parole period in some way had determinative significance in the sentencing of the appellant.  Such an approach was rejected in Muldrock: esp at [32].  The Crown relies upon three cases as suggesting a manifestly inadequate sentence in this case.  An examination of the facts in each confirms the limited utility of comparing outcomes of the exercise of the sentencing discretion, especially as between cases which involve a question of mental illness or disability and those which do not.  In Dionnet v R [2009] NSWCCA 85 there were two occasions of sexual intercourse and the offender used violence to coerce the victim.  The accused was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.  The sentencing judge did not find that the offender's mental state or social functioning in any way diminished his moral culpability for the two offences or that it should otherwise be taken into account in the sentencing process.  In Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 the offender was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and one of sexual intercourse without consent.  The latter involved the offender physically forcing the victim to perform oral sex upon him, albeit for only a short period.  An overall sentence of 8 years was imposed with a non-parole period of 5 years.  On appeal the appellant was re-sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  There was no suggestion that the offender suffered from any intellectual disability or lack of social functioning with the consequences found by the trial judge in this case.  
75The third case relied upon is McCartney v R [2009] NSWCCA 244 in which there was a plea of guilty to one count of sexual intercourse where the complainant and the accused had gone to bed together, but the complainant had made clear that she did not want to have intercourse.  The offender was sentenced to a total term of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months.  Describing the sentence as lying ""within the lowest echelon of the range of available sentences for this serious offence"", this Court rejected an appeal by the offender observing that it was ""difficult to conceive how a lesser sentence"" could be imposed for this offence ""allowing the very greatest mitigation for the undoubtedly substantial matters available to the applicant"".  Again, that case did not involve an offender with an intellectual disability engaging the considerations taken into account by the trial judge in this case.
76The trial judge had regard to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for the offence of which the appellant was found guilty (ROS pp 1, 16, 17).  She had regard to the circumstances of the offence and specifically that it involved penile-vaginal intercourse without the use of a condom, the appellant ejaculating into the complainant's vagina, the complainant being asleep and not capable of consenting, the complainant having her period, there being no evidence of force or coercion although none appeared to have been necessary, no subsequent threats to the complainant about disclosing what had happened, that what had happened (these being the findings of the trial judge on the sentencing hearing which involved rejecting the complainant's evidence at [10] above), that what had happened appeared to have been completely spontaneous and unplanned on the part of the appellant and that the consequences for the complainant were her personal violation and consequent mental trauma.  
77Taking these matters into account, the trial judge assessed the relative seriousness of the offence as being below mid-range seriousness but not at the lowest range (ROS p 17).  That assessment was less favourable to the appellant than the assessment of the offence in McCartney v R which did not involve a sleeping victim.  The trial judge concluded, for the reasons discussed above, that the appellant's personal circumstances called for a ""very much reduced non-parole to parole period ratio"" and for the imposing of a lenient sentence, well below the standard non-parole period.  In the circumstances I am not convinced that the sentence of 3 years with a non-period of 1 year was outside the appropriate range of sentence which might reasonably have been imposed in the circumstances as found.  Whilst I agree that the sentence is at the low end of the range of sentence for this offence, it cannot be described as manifestly inadequate.  Accordingly, ground 6 is rejected.
The appeal against the costs order 
78The trial judge ordered the Crown to pay the costs incurred by the appellant in calling Dr Nielssen assessed at $1500.  She did so under s 177(7) of the Evidence Act 1995.  Her reasons for doing so were as follows:
""On my observation of the cross-examination of [Dr Nielssen], there were issues raised with the report which were unnecessarily raised.  There were issues taken with his assessment of what the expert considered to be the effect of Mr Badans' intellectual disability and the effect that it had on the commission of the offence.  At no time did any part of Dr Nielssen's report challenge the findings of the jury or of the facts.  Issue was also taken with respect to whether Mr Badans would have some difficulty if he was placed in the general prison population....Section 177 is there in order to assist in the streamlining of proceedings before this Court, especially proceedings of this nature.  I did not find any particular assistance by Dr Nielssen's presence here otherwise than providing a courtesy to him of asking him some questions as he had come all this way but otherwise his report was perfectly adequate.""
79The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals from this decision on two grounds.  First, it says that the Evidence Act did not apply to the sentencing proceedings because no direction in accordance with s 4(2)(a) was made that the law of evidence apply to the sentencing proceedings.  Secondly, it says that the power to award costs under s 177(7) may only be exercised against a party ""who has, without reasonable cause, required a party to call a person to give evidence"" and that the trial judge erred in concluding that the Crown did not have reasonable cause to require the appellant to call Dr Nielssen.
80There is an antecedent question as to whether there is a right of appeal.  The appeal is brought by the Director of Public Prosecution under s 5F(2) as being against an ""interlocutory order"" given in proceedings within s 5F(1) for the prosecution of an offender on indictment in the District Court.  In my view an order purportedly made under s 177(7) was such an ""interlocutory order"".  It was made in the course of the sentencing hearing which was part of proceedings to prosecute the appellant.  It did not conclude or finally dispose of those proceedings and was an order made in the course of and ancillary to the exercise of the jurisdiction to convict and sentence: see Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440; R v Pavia (1993) 67 A Crim R 364 at 368-369; Kocer v R [2006] NSWCCA 328 at [13]; Nagi v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 197 at [23].
81In my view each of the two grounds relied upon by the Crown is made out.  No direction was made by the trial judge at any stage in relation to the sentencing proceedings that the law of evidence should apply to that proceeding.  It seems fairly clear that as between the parties a copy of Dr Nielssen's report was served and written notice given on the basis that s 177 would apply.  However, the giving of a notice purportedly pursuant to the section could not cure the absence of a direction under s 4.  When the application for payment of the costs was argued at the end of sentencing proceedings, the Crown pointed out that no such direction had been made.  Even at that stage no direction was made and the trial judge's reasons do not address the Crown's argument that s 177 was not available.  In the absence of a direction under s 4, the Court did not have power under s 177(7) of the Evidence Act to make the order for costs: see, for example, Matzick v R [2007] NSWCCA 92 at [38]; R v Gilham [2007] NSWCCA 323; (2007) 73 NSWLR 308 at [66]. The appellant does not seek to support the order for costs on any other basis.
82Although Dr Nielssen's report includes the Police Facts among the documents referred to as read, it was unclear whether the concluding opinion concerning the appellant's capacity to recognise that the complainant was not in a fit state to give consent addressed the circumstance that the complainant was asleep when he first entered the bedroom.  That uncertainty was relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion and the Crown was entitled to seek to clarify it with Dr Nielssen and explore with him whether the appellant's intellectual disability affected his appreciation that the complainant was not in a fit state to give consent.  That matter was eventually addressed in response to a question from the trial judge (see [66] above).  It was not pursued any further by the Crown.  Nevertheless, the need to clarify this aspect of Dr Nielssen's evidence was a good reason to require Dr Nielssen for cross-examination and the trial judge erred in concluding otherwise.  For these reasons the appeal from this costs order must be allowed.
Conclusion
83The orders I propose are:
(1)Refuse leave to appeal against the conviction on grounds 1 and 2.
(2)Grant leave to appeal against the conviction on ground 3.
(3)Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
(4)Dismiss the appeal against sentence.
(5)Allow the appeal against the order for payment of Dr Nielssen's costs.
(6)Set aside the order made by the District Court on 24 June 2011 that the Crown pay the costs of calling Dr Nielssen in the sum of $1500.

84HOEBEN J:  I agree with Meagher JA and the orders which he proposes.
85ROTHMAN J:  I agree with Meagher JA and the orders he proposes.
86As to the ground of appeal based on an unreasonable verdict, I consider, after examining the evidence, that the evidence as a whole does not raise a reasonable doubt which is not resolved by the ability of the jury to have observed the evidence when adduced: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 85 ALJR 571.

2708210,R v HOBLOS [2012] NSWSC 454,"Remarks on SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Mohammed Hoblos, you have been found guilty by a jury of the murder of Hilal Merhi and appear for sentence for that crime.

2It is necessary to find facts, not inconsistent with that verdict, for the purpose of sentence. 

3Arrangements were made for a party to celebrate the 21st birthday of Tanya Merhi at her home in Merrylands. The identity of her surname and that of the deceased is coincidental and they were not related. A variety of methods of invitation to the party were employed, including formal writing, text messaging and oral contact. It seemed to be open to invitees to bring other guests but it was desired that these be identified to the hosts. The offender was not the recipient of a direct invitation and there was no evidence that his intended presence was communicated to Ms Merhi or any member of her family.

4The party took place on the evening of the Anzac Day holiday, 25 April 2009. Estimates of the number present unsurprisingly differed but on any view the assembly was very large. A figure of about 150 guests was offered.

5An area of the premises had been allocated for dancing and music was provided there.

6At about 11.00pm there was a pause for cutting a birthday cake, singing the traditional song and some short speeches. Thereafter the party continued and, in particular, people resumed activities in the dance area. One of these people there was Hilal Merhi.

7Two persons wearing hooded upper garments came from the street into the dance area. The hoods were raised over the heads of these intruders. One of them produced a handgun, the evidence points to it being a type called a Glock, and fired five shoots into the body of Hilal Merhi. The shots were fired from relatively close range and the impact of the projectiles was fatal.

8The two intruders then quickly left the area and entered a waiting car, the driver of which then took them from the scene.

9The killing of Hilal Merhi in this manner was referred to as an execution. That was an apt description. I am satisfied to the necessary standard that each of three participants committed the crime of murder. I find that the person who fired the five shots at close range into the body of the victim intended to kill him and by his actions achieved that object. I find that the second intruder was guilty of murder as an aider and abettor, present at the time and aware of the essential facts in that he saw the shooting and was, I conclude, aware of the intention of the shooter and ready and willing to give aid if required. I am further satisfied that the person, conveniently described as the driver of the get-away car, was guilty of murder as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to kill Hilal Merhi. I infer the agreement from the circumstances that the intruders approached the victim with an obviously already formed intent and that the driver participated by being positioned to and in fact facilitating the escape of those intruders. 

10As the trial was conducted, no suggestion was made against the conclusion that the two intruders and the driver of the get-away car were in fact all guilty of murder. I am satisfied that the prisoner was one of these three participants although I am unable to determine which role he fulfilled. 

11It was submitted on behalf of the offender that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was one of the two intruders. I agree, but that does not demonstrate that he was necessarily the get-away car driver. As I have said, I cannot determine which role he played but I am satisfied that he was one of the three participants. The purpose of the submission was to contend that the role of the driver was less serious than that of the intruders and that that should operate to mitigate the level of the offender's culpability. I would not discriminate on that basis. Although, to date, the offender is the only identified participant, all three were engaged in carrying out what was accurately described as an execution and their joint liability does not attract gradations so as to differentiate their individual culpabilities.

12Counsel referred to a variety of individual and incidental testimonies, the absence of observation of facial hair on the intruders such as was worn by the offender at the time, what some witnesses thought they remembered as clothing worn by the intruders, the wearing by one of the intruders of a charm not usually worn by members of the offender's particular religious sect and matters which I will not schedule but are set out in the written submissions. I shall refer to some of these later.

13It suffices to record that none of the matters asserted, either individually or in combination, persuade me even as a matter of probability which role the offender fulfilled. Neither, as I have stated, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt what role he fulfilled and the situation remains that I am satisfied that the offender was one of the three participants but I cannot say which one.

14As the jury necessarily, and I also, rejected the testimony of the offender that he was present at the premises in response to an indirectly received invitation and, in effect, a bystander uninvolved in the killing, I must turn to facts demonstrating his inculpation. It scarcely needs to be said that the rejection of his testimony does not operate to prove prosecution allegations. 

15No witness identified the intruders or the driver. Unsurprisingly there were inconsistent descriptions by those who saw the hooded intruders. The conclusion which I draw from the evidence is that it does not exclude the offender from possibly being one of them. Some attention was paid to an observation by a witness that one of the intruders was wearing an amulet in the shape of a sword or scimitar. The wearing of such was evidenced as the custom of adherents to the faith of Islam other than the Sunni sect of which the offender is a member. I do not find that anything turns on this. I am unable to determine whether such a charm was worn for a genuine or deceptive purpose. I find the evidence was of no weight in establishing the possible identity of the wearer. In so saying, I expressly do not ignore the onus of proof borne by the prosecution.

16I find that the proof of complicity commences with a conversation between the offender and Eileen McGeachy (also know as Giselle) at the Carnes Hill Market Place. Although Ms McGeachy was vague about dates, the conversation clearly related to the killing of Hilal Merhi and was subsequent to it. The extent of what amounted to an admission by the offender was that he was ""involved"" and her testimony was that he added no detail. In that he said that he was ""involved"" I am satisfied that he was referring to involvement in the killing.

17I should deal with an aspect of Ms McGeachy's evidence which was the subject of particular dispute. A transcript of cross-examination records her as saying ""Well, he never said that he was involved. If he was involved, I wouldn't know, so"". The first sentence, if accurately recorded, is a plain contradiction of her evidence in chief that he had told her that he was involved. The Crown contended that what the witness had said was ""Well, he never said how he was involved"". Counsel for the offender did not accept that this was correct. For the purposes of the jury, I instructed then that it was for them to determine what they heard the witness say and I do not need to recapitulate the direction given.

18For present purposes, I am satisfied that the evidence was as contended by the Crown for these reasons. The immediately following question by the cross-examiner was ""I suggest to you he didn't use the word involved"". That question would not logically follow upon a concession that the witness had said ""he never said he was involved"". Next, in cross-examination of the offender, it was put to him that he had told Ms McGeachy at Carnes Hill shops that he was involved. No objection was raised that the basis for such question had been extinguished by Ms McGeachy resiling from her evidence in chief. It would be more than surprising if any witness having flatly contradicted the critical part of her evidence in chief had that evidence in chief put to the accused but this was not noticed by counsel.

19As I shall later again make a reference, there is some fortification for the evidence of Ms McGeachy in an exchange between the offender and his sister in a telephone call which was intercepted when he said of Ms McGeachy concerning a proposal that she should say that she was going to a party with him that ""She knows a bit"". That would be consistent with her having been told by him of ""involvement"" without any detail.

20The next matters of inculpation of the offender derive from telephone conversations in which he participated some three or four months after the killing. The offender was in prison serving a sentence for driving whilst disqualified. Whilst there he came into possession of a mobile phone but investigators did not interfere with that possession and obtained authorisation to intercept his calls. 

21No doubt there were many calls which were not perceived to be relevant but the evidence manifests a sequence of exchanges which I am satisfied showed a consciousness of guilt of the offender's participation in the killing of Hilal Merhi. Of course, the language used was frequently guarded but it is the combination, including timing and sequence, which leads to the conclusion, although in isolation many of the utterances might be categorised as raising only suspicion.

22After 10.30pm on 6 August 2009, Mohammed El-Hage called the offender from a public telephone. Earlier police had shown him telephone records locating the offender's phone in the area where the party was taking place on the previous Anzac Day. El-Hage had been at the party and was in the company from time to time of the victim. There were numerous calls from the offender's phone to El-Hage's phone leading up to immediately before the killing but most were unanswered and diverted to voicemail. El-Hage, the offender and the victim were acquainted with each other.

23It is significant that, when police informed El-Hage that they could locate the offender at the party, he proceeded to make the call from the public telephone. It is consistent with a belief on his part that the offender needed to be put on notice that he might need to explain his presence at Merrylands, a need which would hardly be required if the offender were merely an expected guest who had been invited to come along or for that matter, an uninvited guest, with no more intent than attending the party.

24The content of the call demonstrated an acknowledgement by the offender of a suggestion to explain his presence at the party and his reason for departure.

25Bearing in mind that the party was the occasion of an execution style killing taking place, after hearing from El-Hage, the offender, late that night made a series of calls. First he rang Eileen McGeachy. He gave her as a topic reference, the situation that he had talked to her about at Carnes Hill. This links directly to her evidence that it was there where he told her that he was ""involved"" when discussing the death of Hilal Merhi. In the call he asked her for a favour although what the favour was was not clearly articulated. What he did say was that he might never come out, obviously from gaol, or until after a ""big whack"" and in response to a question about what he meant he said he was talking about ""life"".

26The call from El-Hage had related to the party at which the killing occurred. The only rational link between the party and a fear of life imprisonment or near thereto in the particular context was responsibility for that killing. 

27After this call the offender rang his sister. He gave her cautions about the use of telephones and talking to police. Again there is a link in his expression to her of apprehension about gaol for his whole life.

28The next call is to a friend, Suzy Dzevlan, to whom he asked that El-Hage be asked to get in touch. As noted, El-Hage had made the call shortly beforehand from a public telephone. Again the offender tells Ms Dzevlan that he might be doing ""life"".

29Finally, on this note, the offender called Amanda Viola who had been his girlfriend at one stage and, somewhat cryptically, he asked her to look after his family. On 8 August, some two days after the previous exchanges, Amanda Viola called the offender. This call was terminated when, the offender said, the authorities were doing a check and he called her back. Essentially the two calls combined to make one communication.

30The offender asked her to do him a favour by saying that she had dropped him off at the party. She agreed to the request. Her evidence was that she had not done so. Both she and the offender must have known that what was requested to be said was false. Amanda Viola, in these conversations, apparently with enthusiasm, joined in the proposed deception to the extent of suggesting that the story be embroidered by detail of being in the City together and getting drunk at Star City. These suggestions were adopted by the offender.

31Three days after this contact, the offender again rang his sister. He told her that he had been questioned by detectives about Hilal Merhi. Although he had planned with Amanda Viola to purport to have been with her in the City on the night, it would take little reflection to remember that El-Hage had told him that police were in possession of telephone records which tended to locate him at Merrylands. He asked his sister to persuade Giselle (Eileen McGeachy) to say that he was with her going to a party. 

32The offender's sister was not a witness and the extent of her knowledge was unexplored however she asked, referring to Ms McGeachy, and speaking in Arabic ""Does she know, did you tell her?"". This brought the response that I earlier mentioned, namely, ""She knows a bit but tell her to do this as a favour"". Later he elaborated to his sister that what should be said was that he and Hage (El- Hage) were drunk and that the offender was with Ms McGeachy to whom he was engaged at the time.

33Although the word itself does not incriminate, it can be observed that the offender was describing the intended deception as ""the alibi"".

34Two further calls to the offender's sister and Amanda Viola referred to investigations proceeding with unspecified people being questioned and, to Ms Viola, an exhortation to say nothing if approached, that is, by inference if approached by police.

35I recognise of course that the Crown case is dependant upon what amounted to circumstantial admissions however I am satisfied that there is no rational explanation for the overall content of what the offender said to Ms McGeachy at Carnes Hill and to those to whom he spoke on the intercepted telephone calls other than that he had been one of the participants in carrying out the killing of Hilal Merhi.

36Counsel for the offender submitted that it was ""the Crown case theory that the motive for the killing was an act of retaliation against (the victim) for (his) murder of (a) Mr Massoum"". The Crown did not assert that motive. There was evidence that there were apparently some person or persons who had expressed that view but it went no further. Why Hilal Merhi was killed remains unknown. Curiously, and I emphasise that it is not evidential, in a victim impact statement the deceased's mother said that he ""wasn't able to leave the house (be)cause of being afraid that he was going to get seen and killed"". What might have given rise to such a situation was not stated. 

37The submission by Counsel invited a conclusion that the verdict was consistent with finding that the offender's role was that of assisting in a purpose generated and planned by others. I do not reach such a conclusion. The offender was one of three people putting into effect a decision which inevitably had previously been made to execute Hilal Merhi. I do not know from where the inspiration to kill him was derived.

38The foregoing sufficiently explains reasons for rejecting the submission that the killing was below the mid-range of seriousness of the crime of murder. However I also reject the Crown's submission that the level of culpability was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence. Leaving aside any other considerations, a great deal is unknown about the circumstances out of which the killing arose, but such a finding of extremism would require reliance upon a significant degree of speculation. One example of the flaws in the Crown submission is attempting to answer the question why the crime was committed in a public place by contending that there could have been an ""intended message"". I do not need to elaborate the difficulties which the onus of proof presents to that contention. 

39Before turning to other matters I should acknowledge receipt of the victim impact statement read by the mother of the victim to which I have already made some reference. What is acknowledged is the grief and continuing pain of a mother who has lost her son and the same feelings have no doubt been engendered in other family members. Felonious taking of life is rightly considered by society as conduct meriting condemnation and these observations are intended to reflect that condemnation and to offer condolences to the family who have suffered the loss.

40Subjective matters pertinent to the offender are substantially to be extracted from a psychological report by Ms Player which was tendered on his behalf. She did not seek any comment from him as an account of the offence but noted that he told her he was intoxicated with cocaine and methylamphetamine on the night that the crime took place. This was not a matter raised or explored in his testimony at trial. I do not summarise the entirety of her report but have taken its content into account. I note the history, pre offence, of daily cannabis use, nasal ingestion of cocaine at least twice a week and smoking what is commonly called ""ice"" every two or three days. The last mentioned two drugs were described by the offender as elevating feelings of anger and aggression. 

41The offender described a lifetime of anger and fighting commencing from early childhood. He has attained only a basic education and, although a single man, engaged in employment very sporadically. Whilst I acknowledge Ms Player's apparent sincerity in looking to the future, I see no grounds for optimism about the offender obtaining a decent degree of rehabilitation.

42The isolated factor of promise is continuing family support which has been demonstrated by diligent visitation by his family to the offender whilst he has been in gaol to date.

43It is not appropriate to ""checklist"" statutory factors of aggravation but it is obvious that the seriousness of this offence needs to be gauged with an appreciation that a handgun was used and fired in the house, effectively of a stranger, with risk to other people on a crowded dance floor which risk, thankfully, did not fall due.

44I agree with the Crown's submission that the attendance by the offender at the victim's funeral does not, even as a matter of probability, show remorse. It has not been shown to be harboured by the offender otherwise. I make explicit that I have used the statutory prescription of maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for guidance in assessing sentence which inevitably must be imprisonment for a substantial term of years. 

45I also note the references by Counsel to statistical and forensic material. The intention of these remarks is primarily to enable the offender to be informed in language that he can understand of the reasons for the imposition of sentence. That is not to say that I should not also expose the processes of reasoning leading to the assessment.

46An express submission was made that I should extend the balance term of any imprisonment during which the offender may be eligible for parole, relying on the views of Ms Player regarding the need for intensive and long-term support for transition from custody back into the community. I do not find the necessary special circumstances and, in any event, the application of the statutory formula will provide ample scope to see if such hope for transition can be fulfilled. 

47The offender is a comparatively young man, born on 22 December 1981, nevertheless it is inevitable that a substantial sentence be imposed, an important element of which needs to convey that assisting in any way in the perpetration of a gangland-style execution will be met with significant severity. As noted, when the offender was charged he was in custody on an unrelated matter but he has since been detained without bail. Counsel have agreed that sentence now to be imposed should commence on 14 March 2010 and I consider that appropriate.

48Mohammed Hoblos, for the murder of Hilal Merhi you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 21 years commencing on 14 March 2010 and expiring on 13 March 2031 with a balance term of 7 years commencing on 14 March 2031.

49The effective total term is 28 years. The earliest date for consideration of release to parole is specified as 13 March 2031.

2708212,Opoku v P & M Quality Smallgoods P/ L & others Opoku v Kaybron No 6 P/L [2012] NSWSC 478,"Judgment
1Kofi Opoku, who was born on 14 June 1960 in Ghana, claims damages for personal injuries he sustained on 1 May 2004 when he was working as a cleaner in the boning room of a meat processing factory. 
2The plaintiff has commenced two sets of proceedings relating to the same events against five separate defendants. The proceedings were heard together. The first set of proceedings were brought against P & M Quality Smallgoods Pty Limited (P & M), Kaybron No. 15 Pty Limited (Kaybron 15), Kaybron No. 16 Pty Limited (Kaybron 16) and the trustees of the Homebush Unit Trust (HUT). The second set of proceedings was brought against Kaybron No. 6 Pty Limited (Kaybron 6). Kaybron 15 and Kaybron 16 were deregistered and proceedings were discontinued against them. Kaybron 6 was deregistered and the pleadings were amended to substitute the Nominal Insurer by its agent QBE Workers Compensation (NSW) Pty Limited (QBE).
3QBE has cross-claimed against P & M and HUT for indemnity pursuant to s 151Z(1)(d) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987. QBE has cross-claimed against the plaintiff in respect of payments made to the plaintiff pursuant to s 151Z(1)(b) of that Act.
Facts
4The plaintiff started working for P & M on 20 October 1999 as a cleaner, shortly after his arrival in Australia from Ghana, where he operated a tailoring business. His hours of work at P & M were from 7.30 pm until about 3.00 am.
The arrangements made by P & M for its workforce
5P & M conducted a business of producing and selling processed meats, which it operated from premises and plant which it owned at 18 Hume Highway, Chullora.
6Up until about 2003, P & M employed all the staff engaged in its operations. In about 2003 it decided to arrange for another entity, HUT, to employ its supervisory and managerial staff, while P & M itself continued to employ the processing and cleaning staff. The purpose of this was, according to George Ujvary, who was then the Chief Financial Officer of P & M, to reduce its workers' compensation premiums. The workers' compensation premiums were higher for workers engaged in processing meats because of the relatively higher dangers associated with their work, as compared with supervisory and office staff. 
7In 2004, P & M decided to minimise its workers' compensation premiums still further by dividing its workforce into smaller groups of workers so that thresholds pertaining to payroll in the calculation of workers' compensation premiums were not exceeded. To that end, it caused some 40 companies to be incorporated, each with the name Kaybron and a numeral, to distinguish each company from the others. Each of the Kaybron companies would employ a group of workers. It is accepted that the plaintiff was employed by Kaybron 6.
8None of the Kaybron companies had a bank account or employed anyone in a supervisory or managerial capacity. Kaybron 6 did employ persons who were senior to the plaintiff but junior to HUT supervisors as either team leaders, such as Charles McCarthy, and leading hands, including Eric Osei-Bowadu and George Salloum.
9Such persons had limited power to give directions to cleaners, such as the plaintiff. Group Certificates issued to such workers were issued in the name of the Kaybron company, the payments by Kaybron companies were journal entries only, the funds for the actual payments being provided by P & M. The workers who supervised the Kaybron workers were employed by HUT, although as referred to above Kaybron 6 employed a Team Leader who had limited supervisory duties.
10By 2004, P & M had no employees. Each of the 1,100 persons who had formerly been employed by it were now employed either by HUT, in the case of managerial or supervisory employees, or by a Kaybron company in the case of manual workers such as boners and cleaners.
11Throughout this period P & M, HUT and the Kaybron companies had common directors: Paul Lederer and John Hunt.
12The relevant legislation was amended on 1 July 2007 to take away the incentive for the structure adopted by P & M. In July 2010, as a result of the amendments, P & M reverted to the original situation and re-employed all of the workers engaged in its operations. All of the Kaybron companies were then deregistered, the reason for their existence having ceased.
13As at the date of the accident, 1 May 2004, the plaintiff's Group Certificates were issued in the name of Kaybron 6.
14Answers to interrogatories administered to P & M establish the following:
(1)P & M occupies the entire factory premises and owns the conveyor against which the plaintiff says that he fell, resulting in his injuries;
(2)Kaybron 6 was responsible for cleaning the conveyor at the end of the production shift; and
(3)Kaybron 6 occupies the area in relation to cleaning systems for the conveyor and the boning room in which it is situated.
15The plaintiff alleges that Kaybron 6 was his employer. No other party alleges that the plaintiff was employed by anyone other than Kaybron 6. Kaybron 6 admits that it was the plaintiff's employer.
The plaintiff's duties
16The plaintiff's duties included cleaning the floor and the conveyor belts in the boning room. The tasks were carried out in the following sequence. First, the floor surrounding the conveyor belts was cleaned. Then, the conveyor belt would be rinsed with automatic sprinklers which were fitted to the belt. The water would loosen debris on the belt. Then soap would be sprayed through automatic sprinklers onto the belt. Finally, the conveyor belt would be hosed down with water from a hose carried by a cleaner, such as the plaintiff. The hosing down of the conveyor belt was designed to remove any vestiges of meat that remained on the conveyor. The hosing down was conducted while the conveyor was moving. While the plaintiff was working he wore rubber boots supplied by P & M.
17The plaintiff received instruction on how to perform his cleaning duties from the time he was first employed by P & M. Mr. Rajesh Ram was his supervisor. Mr Ram was originally employed by P & M but in 2003 he became employed by HUT. Neither the way of performing his duties, nor the conveyor belt itself, changed during the period of his employment. He was instructed to perform the hosing of the conveyor belt while the conveyor was still moving. This is what he was doing when the accident occurred.
The circumstances of the accident
18The plaintiff was about to finish his night shift on 30 April/1 May 2004. He was standing near the conveyor belt when he noticed a piece of meat on the conveyor. He endeavoured to dislodge the piece of meat with water from the hose. However, as he did so, he slipped on the floor and the fourth finger of his left, non-dominant, hand was injured when it became caught at the junction between the conveyor belt and one of the rods supporting the conveyor apparatus. His co-worker, Mr Osei-Bowadu, a leading hand who was passing the area, came to assist him. The plaintiff's finger was bleeding profusely. Mr Osei-Bowadu took him to a separate room, reported the incident to Sasa McCarthy, the plaintiff's Team Leader, who was also assisted by one of his sons. The incident was also reported to Mr Newman, the factory manager. Mr Osei-Bowadu then drove the plaintiff to Bankstown hospital for treatment.
19Mr Osei-Bowadu's recollection was that he saw the plaintiff squatting beside the conveyor belt before he called to say that he had injured himself. I do not consider that it matters whether the plaintiff was sitting or crouching beside the conveyor belt, in light of my findings below.
20The plaintiff was cross-examined by reference to various statements, including a report of injury, which he had signed, which gave a somewhat, but not entirely, different version of how the accident happened. Although I have reservations about the plaintiff's credibility in so far as it affects his evidence of pain and incapacity, I accept that his hand came into contact with the conveyor belt while it was moving and while he was hosing it. I reject the suggestion that the plaintiff was attempting to dislodge a piece of meat from the conveyor with his hand. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his hand came into contact with the conveyor because the plaintiff slipped, either when he was standing or when he was crouching. The contact was accidental and not deliberate. Any differences between the plaintiff's oral evidence and statements he has signed which were not interpreted are explicable on the basis that he is not particularly literate in English. 
21I accept that the plaintiff's command of English has improved since the date of the accident and the time when the incident report form was completed. The improvements have come about in part by the fact that he lives in Dubbo with his girlfriend, with whom he speaks English and he has done a TAFE course in Dubbo to learn basic English and computer skills.
After the accident
22The plaintiff was seen at 4.05 am and treated at the Emergency Department of Bankstown hospital. An X-ray of his left fourth finger revealed an undisplaced fracture through the tuft of the distal phalanx but no other bony injury. His finger was sutured with nine stitches. He was discharged to be reviewed by his general practitioner for removal of the stitches in ten days. The plaintiff was driven home by a friend.
23About ten days after the accident, the stitches were removed by Dr Ghulam Sachawars, a general practitioner. The cut opened up again and had to be dressed. Dr Sachawars referred the plaintiff to Dr Simon McKechnie, a neurosurgeon, who saw him on 5 June 2004. Pain relief was prescribed.
24Dr Sachawars also referred the plaintiff to a hand surgeon, Dr James Masson, who saw him in July 2004. Dr Masson did not consider surgery to be indicated. In his report of 21 July 2004 he opined:
""...I can see no reason why he could not be back at work at least in some capacity if not his normal capacity as it has been over two months since his injury.""
25Dr Masson reviewed the plaintiff on 23 August 2004. He reported to Dr Sachawars in the following terms:
""Mr Opoku has had some improvement in his sensitivity with the use of Opsite. I have explained to Mr. Opoku that he can always expect to have some discomfort in this finger due to his nerve injury but I do not believe that surgery has any place in his management. I think that Mr. Opoku should return to work on normal duties.""
26The plaintiff's employment was terminated on 16 September 2004 by letter on the letterhead of P & M, under the hand of a Human Resources Manager who was apparently employed by P & M. There is no reference in this document to Kaybron 6.
27Later in 2004, the plaintiff consulted Dr Guirguis, who since that time has regularly provided medical certificates certifying his unfitness for work. The plaintiff has continued to consult Dr Guirguis, who practises from Lidcombe, every six weeks or so notwithstanding that the plaintiff has been living in Dubbo for some years.
28The plaintiff has consulted medical practitioners of various specialties both for reassessment and medicolegal assessment. He was referred for medicolegal assessment to Dr Paul Curtin, a plastic surgeon, who opined in a report dated 4 October 2005:
""I am unable to account for the extreme symptoms of sensitivity displayed by this man. Even in cases where there is known injury to the digital nerve, it is always possible to carry out a gentle examination to locate the area of maximum sensitivity. Although only a visual examination was possible, nevertheless there was no clear evidence of any injury to his digital nerve. One would also normally expect to find a degree of permanent stiffness in an affected part that was apparently excluded from normal use. There was no evidence of any such stiffness in this case. I would not recommend amputation of his injured left ring finger. Such an operation would result in division of both digital nerves and the likelihood of deterioration in his symptoms. It seems likely there are strong psychological issues involved here, and I believe that any surgical intervention on this mans [sic] finger would be unwise.""
29The plaintiff has not attempted to obtain any employment, whether remunerative or otherwise, at any time since the accident. He tried to return to work at P & M about three months after the accident but found that he was unable to continue. He has received workers' compensation payments since the date of the accident.
30The plaintiff was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident in July 2006 which caused him to suffer an injury to his neck which troubled him for a short period of time and from which he recovered.
31The plaintiff subsequently moved to Dubbo because of the lower cost of living. He presently lives with his girlfriend, Sizakuhle Ndlovu.
Liability
Whether each defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care
Whether Kaybron 6 owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and the content of that duty
32As appears from the narrative above concerning the various defendants, P & M was, prior to the change in its arrangements in 2004, the plaintiff's employer. P & M, as the plaintiff's former employer, owed him a non-delegable duty of care for so long as it was the plaintiff's employer. In 2004, P & M arranged for the plaintiff to be employed by Kaybron 6. Kaybron 6 did not employ supervisors or managers and it did not have a bank account or resources of its own. Accordingly, by design, it was neither in a position to discharge any duties of care to the plaintiff, nor to remunerate him from its own resources. However, in light of the pleadings, and the facts that Kaybron 6 paid the plaintiff's remuneration during the relevant period and appeared on the pay slips and group certificates, I find that Kaybron 6 was the plaintiff's employer. 
33As the plaintiff's employer, Kaybron 6 owed a non-delegable duty to the plaintiff to take reasonable care, and to ensure that reasonable care was taken, to provide him with a safe place of work, a safe system of work and safe plant and equipment: Leighton Contractors Pty Limited v Fox [2009] HCA 35; 240 CLR 1, Kondis v State Transport Authority [1984] HCA 61; 154 CLR 672 and TNT Australia Limited v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; 65 NSWLR 1.
34Kaybron 6 submitted that it had a ""bare non-delegable duty"" and had ""no opportunity to change the workplace or system of work"". It is not clear what is meant by the word ""bare"" in that context. That Kaybron 6 had no present capacity to discharge its duty to its employees does not lessen the duty it owed. As the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, and Heydon JJ) said in Andar Transport Pty Limited v Brambles Limited [2004] HCA 28; 217 CLR 424 at [34]:
""[T]he duty is imposed upon all employers, however the business be formed or structured. As Lord Wright noted in Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English: 
[T]he whole course of authority consistently recognizes a duty which rests on the employer and which is personal to the employer, to take reasonable care for the safety of his workmen, whether the employer be an individual, a firm, or a company, and whether or not the employer takes any share in the conduct of the operations."" [Emphasis added]
35I do not need to consider the operation of the Civil Liability Act 2002, apart from s 5Q, since civil liability for compensation under the Workers Compensation Act is excluded from its operation: Civil Liability Act s 5A(2) and s 3B(1)(g). Section 5Q provides that where an employer entrusts another with the task of providing the employee with the place and/or system of work, and/or with plant and equipment the employer will generally be vicariously liable for failure by that other person to exercise reasonable care in those matters.
36It was submitted by Kaybron 6 that s 5Q does not apply because Kaybron 6 did not in fact entrust some aspect of the work to P & M or HUT when it was, if anything, the reverse since P & M allocated its employees to the Kaybron companies. I reject this submission. Although the evidence establishes the development of the arrangement which applied at the time of the plaintiff's accident in 2004, the plaintiff was, in fact and law, employed by Kaybron 6 at that time, which accordingly owed him a duty to provide him with a safe system of work. It can be inferred from Kaybron 6's lack of capacity to do anything to affect the safe system of work (since it had no employees with authority to do so, and no means to effect such changes) that it delegated, or purported to delegate, its duty to provide a safe system of work to P & M and HUT. For these reasons I consider that s 5Q does apply in the instant case to make Kaybron 6 vicariously liable for breaches by P & M and HUT.
Whether P & M owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and the content of that duty
37P & M relied on Unilever Australia Limited v Pahi [2010] NSWCA 149, in which the Court of Appeal found that the effect of Leighton v Fox was that the duty of a principal was not co-extensive with that of an employer. It submitted that it owed no duty whatsoever to the plaintiff and all relevant duties were owed by Kaybron 6 as the plaintiff's employer. It submitted that its power to intervene to change the system of work did not impose a duty to intervene to change it to make it safe.
38In my view, P & M continued to owe duties to the plaintiff even though, by 2004, it was no longer his employer. It had created the system of work, which remained unchanged for the period of the plaintiff's employment at its premises. It had created a corporate arrangement whereby Kaybron 6, the plaintiff's employer, employed neither managers nor supervisors, although it did employ leading hands. It had also arranged for HUT to employ managers and supervisors but it was not explored in the evidence whether such persons had authority to change the system of work that had been instituted by P & M. Although the corporate arrangement did not absolve Kaybron 6 from fulfilling the non-delegable duty it owed to the plaintiff, the arrangement and the way in which it worked in practice imposed duties on both P & M and HUT.
39It was conceded by P & M that team leaders and leading hands employed by the Kaybron companies did not have authority to change the system of work and in particular did not have authority to direct that conveyor belts be stopped while they were being cleaned.
40Mr Ujvary's evidence established that P & M was the entity which co-ordinated the workforce of the various Kaybron companies and HUT for the benefit of its own business of selling processed meats. The Kaybron companies and HUT were not merely labour hire companies. I consider that, in the particular circumstances of the corporate structure created by P & M, and of the practical realities as deposed to by Mr Ujvary, P & M owed the plaintiff a continuing duty to monitor the system of work that it had implemented and which continued throughout the period after Kaybron 6 became the plaintiff's employer, to take reasonable care to ensure that that system (namely the one it had implemented) did not expose persons who worked on its premises and for its benefit to unreasonable risk of injury. Although I accept that P & M was not required to do all that was within its power to ensure that the employees of Kaybron companies, including Kaybron 6, were provided with a safe system of work, I reject the submission that P & M had no duty whatsoever to the plaintiff once it was no longer his employer.
41In coming to these conclusions I have reviewed the authorities which have considered the respective liabilities of principals, independent contractors, and labour hire companies, including Unilever v Pahi, J Blackwood & Son v Skilled Engineering [2008] NSWCA 142 and Clarence Valley Council v Macpherson [2011] NSWCA 422. Each case, however, depends on its own facts and circumstances.
42I consider facts in the instant case be somewhat different from those cases where the employer and the principal or the person for whose benefit the work is done are at arms' length from each other. Had P & M relinquished control of HUT and the Kaybron companies, or their operations, when it caused its employees to be employed by a new employer (either HUT or the Kaybron companies), P & M may no longer have owed any duty to its former employees. However, the effect of the evidence of Mr Ujvary was that P & M remained the mind of the business and it continued to make significant decisions affecting operations and the way in which the workforce of HUT and the Kaybron companies was to be deployed and arranged. Because of the effective control which it retained and continued to exercise, I consider, as I have said above, that it owed continuing duties to the plaintiff at least with respect to the system of work that it had previously instituted and which was still in place, unchanged, at the time of the accident.
43P & M was also the occupier of the premises and owned the conveyor. I do not consider that it breached any of the duties which it owed the plaintiff, as occupier. 
Whether HUT owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and the content of that duty
44HUT employed the persons, including Mr Ram, who were responsible for supervising employees of the Kaybron companies, including the plaintiff, in the way in which they performed the work. Although the employees of HUT may not have had the authority to change the system of work that had been implemented by P & M, I consider that they had a responsibility, and a concomitant duty, to take reasonable care to bring any deficiencies which could comprise the safety of such systems to the attention both of Kaybron 6 and of P & M.
Breach of duty
45There are three principal bases on which it is alleged that the defendants were negligent: first, that the floor was inappropriate since it was slippery when wet or when it was not clear of debris; secondly, that there should have been a guard to separate workers from the moving parts of the conveyor; and thirdly, that the conveyor ought to have been stopped before workers approached it to clean it.
Slippery floor
46As referred to above, the plaintiff alleges that he slipped because the floor was slippery. The plaintiff's evidence, which I accept, was that the floor was clean, but wet, when he slipped. The expert opinion of Patrick Donohoe, which was not relevantly challenged, is that wet testing to AS4663 of 2004 (the relevant Australian standard) proved that the surface of the floor was able ""to offer a secure form of upright ambulation, all things being equal"". There is a low risk of a slip event when wet. The testing of the floor when wet and when dry produced similar results although, as one would expect, the floor was slightly more slippery when wet. The first task that the plaintiff and his co-workers were required to do was to clean the floor and this was done before the conveyors were cleaned. 
47I do not consider that any of the defendants was in breach of any duty owed to the plaintiff by reason of the floor. It was, as Mr Donohoe considered, made of an appropriate material which meant that it was suitable, even when wet.
Lack of guard
48I am not satisfied that it was reasonable to install a guard which would prevent any contact between the limbs of the cleaners and the moving parts of the conveyor since it was the conveyor which was the principal piece of equipment which needed to be cleaned. Even had such a guard been installed, it would in all probability have had to be removed in order to gain access to the conveyor belt to clean it. I do not consider that any of the defendants was in breach of the duties it owed to the plaintiff by failing to install a guard to prevent contact between the plaintiff and the moving conveyor.
System of work: allowing the conveyor to continue operating while being hosed
49The meticulous cleaning of conveyors was essential to food hygiene and the safety of the meat products processed on the conveyors. The removal of every skerrick of meat required cleaners to stand in relatively close proximity to the conveyors so that they could see the conveyors clearly and apply water through the hose to a particular area. The risk of harm to the plaintiff was foreseeable and not insignificant. Although the plaintiff's injury was not, in the end, disabling, injuries sustained by contact between human limbs and moving machinery can be very serious. The burden of stopping the conveyor while the process of hosing the conveyor with water occurred was not onerous having regard to the risk involved. 
50The conveyor was not inherently dangerous. It was its movement while being cleaned that created a dangerous environment for the plaintiff. Whether the conveyor was moving when it was cleaned was a matter which pertained to the system of work and therefore part of the plaintiff's employer's obligations. The substantial cause of the plaintiff's injuries was that  the conveyor was moving while he was hosing it. This was, in my view, an unsafe system of work. It exposed the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of injury. Reasonable care required, in my view, that the cleaners be instructed not to clean the conveyor with hoses while it was moving and to ensure that it was stopped before they approached it with a hose. I accept Mr Donohoe's opinion that the system of work was unsafe and that the foreseeable risk of injury could have been reduced, if not removed altogether, if the conveyors were stopped while they were being cleaned.
Breach by Kaybron 6
51I find that Kaybron 6 breached the duty of care that it owed to the plaintiff, as the plaintiff's employer, to take reasonable care to provide him with a safe system of work by permitting and requiring the plaintiff to clean the conveyor with a hose while the conveyor was moving. 
Breach by P & M
52I also find that P & M breached the duty of care that it owed to the plaintiff to monitor the systems that it had instituted and which were still in place for workers employed on its premises, albeit by another entity, who were engaged for the benefit of its business. For the reasons given above I consider that the plaintiff has established negligence consistently with the principles in s 5B and s 5C of the Civil Liability Act. 
53By reason of s 5Q, Kaybron 6 is vicariously liable for the breach by P & M.

Breach by HUT
54I also find that HUT breached the duty of care that it owed to the plaintiff to detect and bring to P & M's attention any unreasonable risk to which the employees it was supervising, including the plaintiff were subjected by the system of work that P & M had established when it employed the whole workforce. I consider that it was unreasonable for HUT not to bring to Kaybron 6's attention the unreasonable risk of injury to which cleaners were subject when they hosed the conveyor belt when it was moving. Although there was some evidence which suggested that none of the witnesses was aware that anyone else had been injured in a similar way, this did not make the injury sustained by the plaintiff any less foreseeable. Nor, in my view, does it have the effect that the stopping of the conveyor did not amount to a reasonable precaution having regard to the risk. 
55The fact that Mr Ram, who was employed by HUT, was not present during the night shift when the plaintiff's accident occurred is not to the point since the duty which was breached was not the duty of immediate supervision, but rather related to the system of work. In my view, HUT is not absolved from fault by reason of the fact that those staff members who were more senior to the plaintiff on the night of 30 April/1 May 2004 were employed by Kaybron 6, rather than HUT.
56By reason of s 5Q, Kaybron 6 is vicariously liable for the breach by HUT.
Contributory negligence
57It is well established that in employment relationships, there is usually a lesser allowance for contributory negligence because of the relationship: see Thompson v Woolworth's (Queensland) Pty Limited [2005] HCA 19; 221 CLR 234 at [40]; and Bankstown Foundry Pty Limited v Braistina [1986] HCA 20; 160 CLR 301 at [15].
58I do not consider this defence to have been made out by any of the defendants. I am not persuaded that the plaintiff's hand came into contact with a moving conveyor by reason of any failure on his part to take reasonable care for his own safety.
Apportionment between defendants
59Apportionment reflects causal potency: Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492 at [8]-[10], per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Deane JJ. As I have said above, I consider that P & M owed a duty to monitor the system it had instituted and that it failed to do so. Its failure caused the plaintiff's injuries, since it was the continued operation of the conveyor while the plaintiff was hosing it which caused him to suffer injury. HUT failed to identify a foreseeable risk to the cleaners who were expected to clean the conveyor belt while it was moving. Had its supervisors or managers done so, then P & M or Kaybron 6 would probably have changed the system of work. Kaybron 6 subjected the plaintiff to an unsafe system of work. As the plaintiff's employer it must bear the lion's share of responsibility.
60Kaybron 6 bears 60% of the responsibility for the plaintiff's loss. P & M bears 25% and HUT 15%. In making this apportionment, I have also taken into account the findings that Kaybron 6 is vicariously liable for the breaches by P & M and HUT, by reason of s 5Q of the Civil Liability Act.
The Limitation defence
61All defendants pleaded that the plaintiff's claims against them were statute-barred since they were brought well outside the three year limitation period. There was apparent force in this defence: the accident occurred on 1 May 2004 and the plaintiff did not bring proceedings against P & M and HUT until 17 April 2008 when he filed a statement of claim in the District Court or against Kaybron 6 until 16 February 2009.
The Limitation defence: the claim against Kaybron 6 
62By reason of s 151H of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, the plaintiff could not bring a claim for damages in negligence against his employer unless and until he had met the threshold requirement that he suffer a permanent impairment of at least 15%, which was a matter that needed to be assessed. This assessment was not resolved until October 2008 (by a Complying Agreement under s 66A of the Workers Compensation Act which, curiously, identifies the plaintiff's employer as ""Primo Smallgoods""). Accordingly, the cause of action against the plaintiff's employer did not accrue until that date. 
63The plaintiff's claim against Kaybron 6 was brought within time because it was brought within three years of the assessment of his permanent impairment, being the date on which his cause of action against Kaybron 6 accrued.
The Limitation defence:  the claim against P & M and HUT
64The plaintiff's unchallenged evidence was that he was employed by P & M in 1999, his employment was terminated by way of letter dated 16 September 2004 from P & M and that he was first advised by his solicitor in 2007 that his employer was actually Kaybron 6, rather than P & M. The letter of termination was on P & M letterhead, there is no reference in the letter to Kaybron 6 and it is signed ""for P & M Quality Smallgoods Pty Limited"" by Steve Bertram, Human Resources Manager. A subsequent letter, dated 13 April 2005, also on P & M's letterhead was written by the then Human Resources Manager, Anthea Estwick, to the plaintiff's solicitors.
65P & M and HUT submitted that the plaintiff received group certificates which recorded the name of Kaybron 6 and that his tax returns showed the ABN of Kaybron 6 which corresponded with the ABN on the group certificates. They submitted that the plaintiff would have ascertained the identity of his employer had he taken ""all reasonable steps"" to ascertain that fact. In response, the plaintiff submitted that he was not cross-examined about his group certificates or tax returns and that accordingly, P & M could not make that submission, and that it ought not be accepted.
66Section 50D of the Limitation Act 1969 provides, relevantly, that:
(1)a cause of action is discoverable by a person on the first date that the person knows or ought to know the fact that the injury was caused by the fault of the defendant (s 50D(1)(b)); and
(2)a person ought to know of a fact if the fact would have been ascertained by the person had the person taken all reasonable steps before that time to ascertain the fact (s 50D(2)).
67In my view it was reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the fact that he had originally been employed by P & M as the basis for his view that he was still employed by P & M on the day of the accident. His belief would tend to be reinforced by the terms of the letter of termination and the subsequent letter to his solicitors in April 2005 and the fact both letters were sent on P & M letterhead. I do not consider that ""all reasonable steps"" required the plaintiff to investigate whether what appeared to be the case was consistent with his group certificates or whether the ABN on his tax return matched the ABN on his letter of termination or the ABN on his group certificates. 
68At all events, because the matter was not explored with the plaintiff in cross-examination, I accept that the plaintiff has established that he did not appreciate that he had a claim for damages against P & M or HUT until 2007 when he was first advised that he was employed by Kaybron 6 and not, as he had believed, by P & M. His conduct, which is relevant pursuant to s 50D(3), and that of his solicitor is consistent with his belief that it was necessary for him to establish, as against his employer, whom he believed to be P & M, that he had suffered an impairment of 15% or greater before he could commence proceedings against his employer.
69Accordingly, in my view, the plaintiff did not know the identity of the ""defendant"" for the purposes of s 50D(1)(b) until 2007. The identity of his employer was an essential fact in the context of knowing where fault was at issue for the purposes of s 50D(1)(b): Bostik Australia Pty Limited v Liddiard [2009] NSWCA 167 at [46]-[49], per Beazley JA, Ipp and Basten JJA agreeing.
70It follows that the plaintiff's claim against P & M and HUT was brought within time because it was brought within three years after the discovery limitation period. 
Damages
71The plaintiff's right to damages is governed by Division 3 of the Workers Compensation Act. His right to damages against P & M and HUT is governed by the Civil Liability Act.
The extent of the plaintiff's incapacity: past economic loss and damages for future economic loss
72 The plaintiff gave evidence of persisting, but intermittent pain and discomfort in the fourth finger of his left hand, his left arm, his left shoulder and his neck. He said that he suffered shooting pain at times which came on without warning. He gave elaborate evidence of his pain, suffering and lack of capacity to work, care for himself or drive a car. His evidence is largely reflected in the histories he gave from time to time to doctors who examined him for treatment and for medicolegal assessment.
73In his evidence in chief, the plaintiff presented as a broken man, who was timid, fearful and very assiduous in protecting his left hand and arm from any movement or impact. He wore a glove on his left hand.
74During the course of his cross-examination some video footage was shown which depicted an entirely different picture of the plaintiff from the one which was painted through his evidence in chief and in the histories he had given to medical practitioners. The footage, which was taken in September 2010, January 2011 and February 2012, showed him as being able-bodied, capable, well-muscled and entirely unhindered by any physical ailment. It showed him lying on the ground in the course of a picnic, supporting his upper body weight with his left arm; it showed him driving from the Blue Mountains to Sydney to attend a doctor's appointment with Dr Guirgis, who proceeded to certify him unfit for any work; and it showed him carrying bags in his left arm and behaving in a completely normal uninjured fashion as he went about the activities of his daily life.
75The plaintiff was defensive and argumentative when shown the video. He was quick to point out that he had never said that he could not do the things that were depicted in the video and adamant that he suffered pain. When he was cross-examined about the circumstances of the accident he was forceful and articulate. He displayed no aversion or apprehension when revisiting the circumstances of the accident. There was no evidence in these exchanges of any psychological reaction to the memory of the accident or having to articulate the details of what had occurred.
76The plaintiff's written submissions as to the effect of the video evidence were:
""The plaintiff notes the surveillance and the plaintiff submits that his injury to his hand is such that he is not unable to do things but suffers severe pain at times and while the surveillance showed him over a discrete period of times [sic], it did not show him during colder weather when he is more likely to suffer pain and discomfort.""
77Ms Ndlovu, a registered nurse who was born in Zimbabwe and is 30 years old, gave evidence, which in part, corroborated the plaintiff's version. Since she is his girlfriend and obviously very fond of him I do not consider her evidence to be independent. However, just as the plaintiff has misrepresented his disability to the Court, I consider that he has also misrepresented his disability to Ms Ndlovu. She has done household tasks for him because she believes that he is unable to do them. At one stage she said, in my view, accurately: ""Maybe I spoil him."" She has made allowances for him because she believes that he has been genuinely injured. Her answers reflect her credulity. Although at times she sought to protect the plaintiff while she was giving evidence, I consider that she has been largely truthful.
78In my view, the plaintiff has decided to rely on workers' compensation payments and feign disability with a view to obtaining a substantial lump sum in these proceedings. I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence as to his symptoms or incapacity except where it is corroborated or amounts to a statement against interest. I do not accept the plaintiff's explanation, given in cross-examination and in his submissions, of the disparity between his evidence in chief and the histories given to doctors on the one hand and what was depicted in the video on the other.
79The plaintiff gave evidence and histories to doctors about taking marijuana and alcohol for pain relief. I do not accept that the plaintiff has ingested the quantities of alcohol or smoked the amount of marijuana that he purports to have. Nor do I accept that such drugs and alcohol were consumed so as to relieve pain associated with the accident the subject of these proceedings.
The medical evidence
80In accordance with this Court's directions, there were joint conclaves of experts who prepared joint reports which were tendered. 
81None of the medical practitioners who treated the plaintiff or who assessed him for medicolegal purposes saw the footage, to which reference has been made above. 
82The experts were provided with lists of assumptions and questions. For example, the psychiatrists, Dr John Roberts and Dr Patricia Jungfer were asked to make several assumptions, including the following:
""The pain suffered by the plaintiff interferes with his sleep and daily activities...
The plaintiff has difficulties attending to his own personal care am and has had to move on numerous occasions to different share houses.""
83It will be apparent from my assessment of the plaintiff's credibility set out above that neither of these assumptions has been made out. The undermining of important assumptions and the fact that none of the experts saw the video substantially reduces the value of the expert opinions and the joint reports: Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65; 108 CLR 642 and Paric v John Holland [1985] HCA 58; 59 ALJR 844. The disparity between the assumptions given to the doctors and my findings set out above renders the reports of little benefit where the opinions are based on the assumptions.
84Although the medical practitioners whose reports were in evidence were not privy to the video, some included passages which indicated that they did not believe the plaintiff and thought that he was fit for normal duties. For example, Dr Richard Sekel, a consultant in occupational medicine, recorded in a report dated 29 July 2004:
""Mr Opoku is immediately fit for normal hours of work where he does not repeatedly knock the pulp of his left index finger...
Mr Opoku appeared to be so reluctant to return to work, that it raises the question as to whether he has some other agenda, or perhaps is undertaking some other work...
Today, Dr Masson and I agreed that Mr Opoku's pre-injury duties of holding a hose in his right hand, supported by his left, would be quite suitable for him, and could not possibly cause any risk to him. We agreed that he should be able to return to his normal hours immediately...
On 30/7/04 [sic] I had a telephone conference with Dr Sachawars [the plaintiff's then general practitioner] who also stated emphatically that Mr Opoku is now physically fit to return to his normal duties as described above.""
85In his report dated 3 August 2007, Dr Sekel recorded:
""Mr Opoku states that he never uses his left hand and in fact does not even touch anything with it. However, this does not appear to be correct, for the following reasons:
- Although he primarily refused to allow me to touch his left ring finger during the physical examination, at other times when his attention was distracted (while his opposite hand was being examined), I was able to firmly press the left ring finger without causing apparent discomfort.
- After the physical examination, he placed his hand back into a thick woollen glove without apparent discomfort, despite the fact that the glove would have been rubbing the skin surface in an identical manner to the way that he had stated was impossible for him to tolerate during the physical examination.
- After the examination, when he had left my office building, I noted that he had left a personal envelope on my desk, and I took it out to him shortly after he had sat into his car; I noted that before he saw me, he picked up a carton of takeaway food and held it in his left hand, in a completely different manner to that which he had demonstrated during the physical examination.
Mr Opoku states that, because of his left ring finger symptoms, he is unable to undertake any activities and is therefore not looking for work.""
86Prof W Bruce Conolly, hand surgeon, suggested surveillance in his report of 26 April 2012, which is consistent with his having difficulties in accepting the assumptions he has been asked to make or the plaintiff's version of the history and his symptoms. Dr Sekel, amongst others, noted that complaints of extreme sensitivity were not consistent with observed behaviour. Dr Roberts, psychiatrist, did not believe the plaintiff to be genuine in his assessment.
87The absence of any muscle wasting in the plaintiff's left upper limb is consistent with normal use of that limb and inconsistent with any limitation in function.
88The plaintiff submitted that:
""The totality of the evidence establishes that from the date of accident to 2010 the plaintiff had ongoing hypersensitivity and pain as a result of the neuroma over the digital nerve.""
89However, in light of the view I have formed of the plaintiff's credibility I do not accept that the plaintiff had any such hypersensitivity.
90There is nothing in the medical opinions that persuades me that the plaintiff has any physical or psychiatric incapacity to work or care for himself which can be attributed to the injury he suffered on 1 May 2004, which goes beyond 23 August 2004. 
 Findings as to injury and incapacity
91I find that the plaintiff suffered an injury to the fourth finger on his left hand on 1 May 2004. I am not satisfied that the complaints made by the plaintiff at subsequent dates of pain in his arm, shoulder and neck are in any way attributable to the accident, which I find caused a localised injury to his finger. I find that the plaintiff does not suffer from any regional pain syndrome.
92I am satisfied that the plaintiff no longer suffers from any incapacity as a result of the injury to his finger sustained on 1 May 2004. I am satisfied that the plaintiff has no need for attendant care and that he is well able to look after himself and to work in a position which is at least as remunerative as that which he had at the time of the accident. His work capacity is not diminished by the injuries he sustained on 1 May 2004. Nor does he require medication as a result of any such injuries.
93There is some difficulty in determining when the plaintiff recovered sufficiently from the injuries he sustained on 1 May 2004 to regain his  working capacity. The video evidence, which shows him to be able-bodied, was taken some years after the accident. It may be that the plaintiff was fit to return to work prior to 23 August 2004. However, the evidence does not permit me to be more precise than this. I am satisfied that the plaintiff regained his earning capacity no later than 23 August 2004.
Quantum of damages
Damages for non-economic loss
94Damages for non-economic loss are not recoverable from Kaybron 6: s 151G of the Workers Compensation Act. The determination of damages for non-economic loss against P & M and HUT is governed by s 16 of the Civil Liability Act. No damages may be awarded unless the severity of the non-economic loss is at least 15% of the most extreme case. I find that the plaintiff does not meet this threshold. His injuries, although alarming at the time, were relatively quickly resolved and affected only one finger of his non-dominant hand. His recovery was substantially, if not wholly, complete within a few months of the accident.
Past economic loss
95Damages for past economic loss are recoverable from Kaybron 6 under s 151H of the Workers Compensation Act as well as from P & M and HUT.
96The plaintiff is entitled to loss of earnings for the period from 1 May 2004 until 23 August 2004 at a rate which reflects his historical performance of overtime. Since the plaintiff was in receipt of workers' compensation benefits during this period, he has had the benefit of this money and is not entitled to interest on this sum under s 18 of the Civil Liability Act.
Past loss of superannuation
97The plaintiff is entitled to loss of superannuation for the period from 1 May 2004 until 23 August 2004 at a rate which reflects his past economic loss.

Future economic loss
98The plaintiff is not entitled to any sum for future loss of earning capacity.
Past and future gratuitous attendant care services
99Section 15(3) of the Civil Liability Act, which was inserted by the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2008, Sch 1[2], has the effect that the plaintiff is not entitled to past gratuitous attendant services unless the services are provided for at least 6 hours per week and for a period of at least six consecutive months. The amendment, which commenced on 5 November 2008, was retrospective in its operation in that it extends to civil liability arising, and to proceedings commenced, before the commencement of the amendment but does not apply to any proceedings determined before that commencement. Accordingly, the amendment introduced in 2008 which inserted s 15(3) applies to the plaintiff. 
100I am not, for the reasons given above, persuaded that there was a reasonable need for gratuitous services to be provided to the plaintiff for that duration and that period. Because of my finding as to the plaintiff's capacity from 23 August 2004, which is less than six months after the injury, the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages under this head.
Out of pocket expenses - past
101The plaintiff is entitled to an award as against P & M and HUT for out of pocket expenses for the period from 1 May 2004 until 23 August 2004 in so far as those expenses are referable to the injury to the fourth finger of his left hand. He is not entitled to have included in his damages any expenses referable to his arm or shoulder.
Out of pocket expenses - future 
102The plaintiff is not entitled to any provision in his award of damages for out-of-pocket expenses for the future.
Cross-claims
103In the Amended Cross-Claim, QBE has cross-claimed against P & M and HUT for indemnity pursuant to s 151Z(1)(d) of the Workers Compensation Act for payments made to or on behalf of the cross-claimant to, for or on behalf of the plaintiff. It is entitled to an indemnity which reflects the apportionment of liability.
104P & M and HUT submitted that s 151Z(1) requires for its operation that the injury for which compensation is payable was caused under circumstances creating a liability in some person other than the worker's employer to pay damages in respect of the injury. The words ""creating a liability... to pay damages"" refers to a liability in respect of the same injury for which compensation is payable: Kempsey District Hospital v Thackham (1995) 36 NSWLR 492 at 505, per Meagher JA. The evidence reveals that QBE has paid considerably more than the plaintiff was entitled to under the Workers Compensation Act, had the facts, as I have found them to be, been appreciated by QBE. However, in light of the damages award which I make, the difference between what the plaintiff was paid and what he was properly entitled to by way of compensation does not appear to me to be material to the matters for my determination.
105By Amended Second Cross-Claim filed in Court on 3 May 2012, QBE claims from the plaintiff, credit for the extent of the payments made by it to the plaintiff, pursuant to s 151Z(1)(b), in so far as they are included in the award of damages. It is entitled to succeed in its claim.
Miscellaneous
106The parties have requested an opportunity to bring in short minutes of order that reflect these reasons.
Costs
107In the normal course, costs would follow the event and each of the P & M, HUT and Kaybron 6 would be liable to pay the plaintiff's costs since he has succeeded on liability. P & M and HUT would be liable to pay Kaybron 6's costs of its cross-claim. However, I shall defer making a costs order since I have not yet heard the parties on costs.
Orders
108I make the following orders:
(1)Direct the parties to deliver to my chambers short minutes of order within seven days which reflect these reasons.
(2)Stand the matter over for the making of the orders referred to in Order 1 above, and, in the absence of agreement between the parties, submissions on costs.

2708213,R v Jay William COOK [2012] NSWSC 480,"Judgment
1On 30 October 2010, Jay William Cook killed Todd Burrows in Cupar Place, St Andrews, New South Wales.  He did so, having as part of one group of young men engaged in an affray with another group of young men, by stabbing him in the chest with a knife.  
2The stab wound penetrated Mr Burrow's heart.  Shortly afterwards, Mr Burrows fell to the ground bleeding profusely.  Immediate attempts at first aid were unsuccessful.  Mr Burrows was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital, but died before he arrived there.
3Mr Cook was arrested at about 6.30pm on 30 October 2010, and has been in custody ever since.  He was charged with murder.  
4In 2011, during the Local Court proceedings, Mr Cook offered to plead guilty to manslaughter.  The Crown declined that offer.  
5On 2 April 2012, the day the matter was listed for trial before a jury, the Crown determined that it would accept Mr Cook's offer to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter.  On that day, an indictment against Mr Cook for manslaughter was presented in substitution for that upon which he had been originally arraigned.  To that new indictment for the offence of manslaughter, he pleaded guilty.  
6It is now time for Mr Cook to be sentenced for his crime.
7The Crimes Act 1900 provides, for the offence of manslaughter, a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years.  There is no standard non-parole period fixed by legislation.  
Judicial Task on Sentencing8In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing.
9In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Cook by applying well established principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at 1-2.
10These well established principles of law require the judge to determine the extent of the punishment to be imposed and, to determine all of the facts relevant to the sentence.  There is no general requirement for a judge to sentence an offender upon a view of the facts most favourable to the offender.  However, a judge is required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before making findings of fact as to what occurred which facts must also be consistent with the verdict of the jury.  See: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1.
11The appropriate approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154 at [26].
12I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.
The Relevant Legislation13The Parliament of NSW has determined that a sentence may be imposed on an offender for the purposes of ensuring adequate punishment of the offender, the specific and general deterrence of crime, community protection, recognition of the harm caused by the offence, denunciation of the offender's conduct and to make the offender accountable for his or her action and promote their rehabilitation: s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  It is clear that, depending on the circumstances, tension may exist between these purposes.
14Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out the relevant provisions that deal with sentencing procedures generally.  Of particular importance are the terms of s 21A, which identify aggravating, mitigating and other factors the Court is to take into account. The relevant factors are discussed later in this judgment at [45]-[51]. 
Principles of Sentencing15The courts have developed clear guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge.  These common law principles include proportionality, parity, totality and the avoidance of double punishment.
16The importance of these principles is that s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act preserves the entire body of judicially developed sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57]; Muldrock at [18].
17As well, factors established by the common law as affecting sentence, such as whether prison may be particularly burdensome, are also to be taken into account in accordance with s 21A: Muldrock at [19].
The Facts18The Crown and Mr Cook agreed upon a Statement of Facts.  I am satisfied that I should find the facts of the matter in accordance with that statement. They are, in summary, as follows.
19Prior to the evening of 29 October 2010, there had developed a degree of animosity between the members of two groups of young men.  These were young men whose activities centre on the making of graffiti.  It is not unfair to refer to them as graffiti gangs, which is the common parlance. One of the gangs referred to themselves as RK and the other was known as KTS.  Todd Burrows was a member of the RK gang.  Mr Cook was a member of the KTS gang.  
20On the evening of 29 October 2010, members of the RK gang, including one Adrian Climpson, gathered at a house at St Andrews, a suburb of Sydney, situated between Ingleburn to the north, and Campbelltown to the south.  
21Zenton Cook (to whom I shall refer as Zenton), who is unrelated to the offender Mr Jay Cook, but who was a member of the KTS gang, telephoned Mr Cook and sought his assistance for a fight with Mr Climpson.  
22This plan was implemented and Mr Cook was collected from outside his home in a motor vehicle containing four other males, including Zenton. Each of the males was a member of the KTS gang.  
23At the house at St Andrews, where the KTS gang arrived somewhere between 12.30am and 1.30am, there was a confrontation.  Mr Climpson, the intended victim, remained in the house and declined to come out and fight the members of the KTS gang, including Mr Cook.  
24Having unsuccessfully attempted to entice Mr Climpson to leave the house, the members of the KTS gang left the house and were driven away in the motor vehicle in which they had arrived.
25Mr Climpson was informed by other occupants of the house that Zenton, who had confronted them, was carrying a knife.  Accordingly, Mr Climpson telephoned his friend and fellow member of the RK gang, Todd Burrows, who was at a party, also in St Andrews, about a one kilometre away.  Mr Burrows, having received the telephone call from Mr Climpson, said to those assembled at the party, some of whom were members or associates of the RK gang, 
""The KTS boys are at Beth's house with knives and poles, let's go"".
26As a result of this phone call, about 20 young men gathered at the house in St Andrews where Mr Climpson was.  Mr Burrows, and the group he was with, were acting in a generally aggressive manner.  Several of them were carrying bottles and sticks.  
27Mr Burrows asked Mr Climpson for the phone number of one of the males who had earlier been in the group when Mr Climpson had been threatened.  He was given the mobile phone number of Mr Cook.  Mr Burrows then rang Mr Cook and asked him where he was.  Mr Burrows then said to Mr Cook words to the effect of:
""Come to St Andrews shops if you want to go.""
It was agreed by the Crown and Mr Cook that ""to go"" meant to engage in a fight. 
28Mr Cook agreed to meet Mr Burrows at the St Andrews shops.  The purpose of the meeting was to engage in a fight.  
29On the way to the St Andrews shops, the group of which Mr Cook was a part, armed themselves with wooden posts which were three to four foot long. They had acquired the posts by destroying a real estate sign.  The car in which the members of the KTS gang were travelling, drove past the RK gang who had gathered at the St Andrews shops and stopped in Cupar Place, a few hundred metres from the shops.
30Todd Burrows, and about five other males from the RK gang, then ran towards the vehicle.  Todd Burrows was running ahead of the other members of the gang and was the first to reach Cupar Place.
31Whilst that was occurring, Mr Cook, Zenton and Mr Bradley Mackenzie jumped out of the motor vehicle.  Zenton and Mr Mackenzie were carrying the wooden posts with which they had armed themselves.  The other two members of the KTS gang remained in the motor vehicle.
32A confrontation then took place between the members of the two gangs near the corner of Cupar Place and an adjoining street.  Todd Burrows had taken off his T-shirt and wrapped it around his head as a disguise.  He was bare-chested.  The two gangs advanced towards each other.  Fights commenced between some people in the rival gangs.  Mr Cook was hit with an object on the back.  
33As more associates of Todd Burrows, who were members of the RK gang, arrived, Mr Cook and Mr Bradley Mackenzie commenced backing away.  At this stage, Todd Burrows said to Mr Cook ""come back here cunt, I'm not finished with you yet"".  Todd Burrows who was holding a broken bottle in his hand, advanced three or four steps towards Mr Cook.  Mr Cook was by now holding a knife in his right hand. He had apparently found it on the ground. Todd Burrows and Mr Cook swung at each other.  Mr Cook stabbed Todd Burrows on the left side of his chest.  Immediately after the stabbing, Mr Cook ran back towards the parked vehicle and got into it.  
34As Mr Cook and the others got back into the car, they continued to be pursued by Todd Burrows and the other males from the RK gang.  Although he had been stabbed, Todd Burrows was calling out to the occupants of the motor vehicle and managed to throw a bottle through the front passenger window of the vehicle, striking one of the occupants and causing him injury.  Notwithstanding that the motor vehicle came under attack, it was able to escape by speeding off down the road.
35Todd Burrows fell to the ground clutching his chest.  He was bleeding profusely.  Those at the scene notified emergency services and attempted to undertake first aid.  Police who were first to arrive at the scene administered first aid.  Ambulance officers arrived soon after.  Mr Burrows continued to be treated both at the scene and on the way to Liverpool Hospital.  All efforts to resuscitate him failed and he was pronounced dead upon his arrival at the hospital at 2.29am.  
36A post-mortem examination by a forensic pathologist established that Mr Burrows had died from a stab wound from a knife or similar object to the left side of his chest, with injury to the underlying heart.  This caused significant blood loss and the collapse of his left lung.  The wound was of sufficient force to cause incision damage to Mr Burrows' sixth and seventh ribs, and to the left ventricle of his heart.  There was an incised injury to Mr Burrow's left forearm caused by the application of a sharp force (possibly by a knife or similar object).  Toxicology analyses of Mr Burrows revealed a blood alcohol level of 0.143 grams per 100mls of blood.  The tests also detected the presence of an ecstasy-like stimulant drug.
37After leaving the scene, the motor vehicle carrying Mr Cook drove to a house at St Andrews.  On the way Mr Cook threw the knife that he had used out of the window.  On arrival at the house, Mr Cook left the vehicle and walked off on foot.  He ultimately returned home.  
38A lawfully obtained telecommunication intercept showed that a few hours after the stabbing, at about 5:15am, Mr Cook sent a text message to Zenton which read as follows:
""Just make sure if I get locked up say you witnessed him swinging the bottle at me first so that I can try get done for self defence lad.""
39Mr Cook was arrested at his home at around 6.30pm on 30 October 2010.  He was taken to the Campbelltown Police Station where he participated in a recorded interview with the police.  In addition to relating some of the facts to which I have made reference, he told the police that he was intoxicated, having been out at a party earlier in the evening, when he had consumed Bundaberg rum.
40He said that he did not know Mr Burrows prior to that evening in question, and had not spoken to him prior to the telephone call.  
41Mr Cook told police that after the brawl commenced, that something hit him on the back.  He then took his jumper off because ""I didn't' want to wreck my jumper"" and ran to help his friends.  He observed Mr Burrows come up towards him carrying a bottle, which had been smashed on the ground.  He said that he looked around for a bottle (with which to defend himself) and instead saw a knife on the ground in the middle of the road.  The knife was about 15cm long and may have been a flick knife.  He didn't know how the knife got there and had not seen it before.  He told police that he picked up the knife thinking that Mr Burrows, the deceased, would not run at someone with a knife, but that Mr Burrows had kept coming and swung at him with the broken bottle in a slashing motion.  He said that he then swung back with the knife, using his right hand and that he had stabbed Mr Burrows.  He claimed to police that he had acted solely in self-defence.
42Later forensic examination of the crime scene did not locate any smashed glass in the area.  However, this agreed fact does not, of itself, contradict the account of Mr Cook about the fact that Mr Burrows was holding a broken glass bottle.
43It was agreed between the parties that the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown on the basis that at the time of the stabbing, Mr Cook formed the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Burrows because he believed that this conduct was necessary to defend himself.  However, as it is agreed, this conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances, as Mr Cook perceived them to be, because he used excessive force.  
44I am satisfied, having regard to the Agreed Statement of Facts, that this is a proper basis for the plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter.
Aggravating Features45Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies a number of matters as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  
46The first which is relevant to this matter, is that the offence involved the actual use of violence: see s 21A(2)(b).  However, given the nature of the crime, I am satisfied that this aggravating factor is accounted for as being an element of the offence and that I should not have additional regard to it.
47It is an aggravating factor if the offence involved the actual use of a weapon: s 21A(2)(c).  The use of a weapon is not an essential element of the offence of manslaughter.  Here Mr Cook used a knife to cause the death of Mr Burrows.  I will take this into account as an aggravating factor.  
48At the time the offence was committed, Mr Cook was in the company of a number of other people in the KTS gang.  This is an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(e).  I will have regard to it as such.  
49Mr Cook was, at the time of this offence, the subject of a bond to be of good behaviour which was imposed by the Childrens Court at Campbelltown on 23 February 2010.  This constitutes him being on conditional liberty and is also an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(j).  Such an aggravating factor is relevant to take into account in imposing sentence, and generally, but not always, results in a longer sentence than would otherwise have been imposed.  
50Finally, it is an aggravating factor if the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(2)(n).  There is no doubt it was a planned act for Mr Cook to attend with his friends on that night to engage in an affray involving members of rival graffiti gangs.  However, I am not prepared to find, in light of all of the circumstances, that this particular offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.  I regard it as a crime which was an unplanned one, which happened opportunistically as Mr Cook defended himself, albeit in the context of a planned confrontation between the two graffiti gangs.
Mitigating Factors51There are a number of mitigating factors identified by s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to which I am required to have regard and to which I do.  They are:
(a)That the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b).  I am satisfied that the offence itself was entirely opportunistic and was not part of a planned criminal activity.  This, in the particular circumstances, has only a small mitigatory effect.  
(b)It will be a mitigating factor if an offender is provoked by a victim: s 21A(3)(c).  Here the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted on the basis that Mr Jay Cook believed that it was necessary to defend himself against an attack upon him by Mr Burrows, but that the conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances because he used excessive force.  I am satisfied that this plea acknowledges that the conduct of Mr Cook was provoked by Mr Burrows.  The fact of provocation has thus been taken into account by the plea and should not result in any additional mitigation.
(c)It is also a mitigating factor if an offender was acting under duress: s 21A(3)(d).  Mr Cook's account to the police was that he felt obliged to support his friends and that was the reason he was participating in the events of that evening, which suggests duress of a minor kind.  I am not prepared to find that in doing what he did, Mr Cook was acting under duress.  He was there of his own free will.  He did not have to get out of the car.  Some of the other members of his gang did not leave the motor vehicle.  His will was not overborne.  He participated freely.  This mitigating factor has not been made out.
(d)Mr Cook has one previous criminal conviction, when he was convicted of breaking and entering a house and stealing goods.  He received a 12 month good behaviour bond.  I do not regard this one minor offence as amounting to a significant record of previous convictions and accordingly, take this into account as a mitigating factor: s 21A(3)(e).
(e)Although Mr Cook was generally a person of good character, the fact that he committed this current offence whilst on a good behaviour bond means that whilst I can take this mitigating factor into account, it is not a particularly weighty one in the circumstances of this case: s 21A(3)(f).
(f)Mr Cook's prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending are also mitigating factors: s 21A(3)(g) and s 21A(3)(h).  Having regard to all of the circumstances, and in particular, Mr Cook's age and overall immaturity, I am satisfied that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and that there is some, but not a great chance of any reoffending in the future.  I take these matters into account as a mitigating factor. 
(g)Where an offender has shown remorse then that can mitigate any sentence: s 21A(3)(i).  I am satisfied by his plea of guilty to manslaughter which was offered at a reasonably early opportunity, that Mr Cook has shown remorse and that he is entitled to the benefit of that remorse.  He did not give any evidence before me, but a handwritten letter from him addressed to me was tendered.  In that letter Mr Cook expresses his remorse and offers his apologies for what has occurred to the family of Mr Burrows and to the Court.  A report by an experienced psychologist, Mr Phil Gorrell (Ex 1), describes Mr Cook as ""most saddened by his offence and he shows remorse"". I take these expressions into account, and give them some weight in all of the circumstances.
(h)Plea of guilty: s 21A(k).  This will be discussed later at [64]-[69].
Seriousness of Offence52The courts have recognised for many years that sentencing for the crime of manslaughter is a difficult task.  That is because the range of conduct which can result in the death of an individual is very great.  In all cases of manslaughter, matters of fact and degree arise.  Views as to the relative importance of particular facts and matters will undoubtedly differ.
53However, one principle which is important for a sentencing judge to always keep in mind when considering the crime of manslaughter is that the starting point for consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in assessing the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case, is that what is involved in this case, and in every case of manslaughter, is the felonious taking of a human life:  See R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported), per Gleeson CJ.
54Manslaughter, as an unlawful homicide, however it occurs, has always been regarded by the law as a most serious crime.  That is because the protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice:  See R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, per Gleeson CJ (James and Ireland JJ agreeing).
55In my opinion, the criminality here was quite serious.  What was involved was an unreasonable use of excessive force by Mr Cook in the act of defending himself.  However, I am persuaded that the conduct of Mr Cook demonstrated a degree of immaturity.  In going to, and then participating in, the fight, Mr Cook's conduct was the product of an inability to resist the peer pressure to which he was subjected and which placed him in an environment in which he should never have been.  
56Using a knife, in the manner he did, to defend himself was also the product of a lack of rational thought, and a lack of any mature understanding of the position in which he found himself.  He displayed all of the hallmarks of an immature teenager.
57I also observe that the invitation to fight came from Mr Burrows to Mr Cook.  Mr Cook did not, himself, take a weapon to the fight but only picked up the knife to defend himself, on the agreed facts, against Mr Burrows who was advancing towards him with a broken bottle.  
Subjective Features58Mr Cook was 18 years old at the time of the offence.  He was due to turn 19 two months after the offence.  He was raised in a family environment, although his parents divorced when he was eight years old.  The family environment was not particularly stable as he did not get along well with his mother's then partner. Both his father and his mother have since found new partners.  He has two younger sisters, and at the time of the offence was employed as an apprentice wood machinist at Minto.  He has good relationships with all members of his family.
59He was educated at both primary and secondary school until about the end of Year 11.  He was quite academically gifted and was well behaved at school, but left school at the beginning of Year 12 to gain employment.  
60Upon leaving school, he was employed, as I have said, as an apprentice wood machinist.  This continued through until his arrest. 
61The evidence satisfies me that since his arrest, and whilst he has been in custody, Mr Cook has been well supported by his family.  Both his mother and his father visit him in custody regularly, and both of them will help with his rehabilitation upon his release from prison. He has undertaken education and employment whilst in custody and has been well behaved.
62Mr Gorrell, a psychologist, provided a report to the Court about Mr Cook, to which I have had careful regard.  I am satisfied that Mr Cook is not innately an aggressive person, and does not maintain any anger about his current circumstances.  On the contrary, Mr Cook accepts that the seriousness of his offence requires punishment.  He is determined to use his time in custody to advance his education and his life.
63Mr Gorrell's report and the views which he expresses, confirm the impression which I had reached from other material, namely, that Mr Cook has good prospects of rehabilitation upon his release.
Early Plea of Guilty64Whilst proceedings were in the Local Court and prior to the order for committal, Mr Cook offered to plead guilty to manslaughter.  This offer was rejected by the Crown.  
65Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that in passing sentence, a court must take into account a plea of guilty and some associated circumstances.  However, the legislation requires that any lesser penalty imposed must:
""... not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.""
66It is entirely appropriate to recognise the offer to plead guilty which, if accepted, would have achieved a utilitarian benefit for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole.  The matter was still in the Local Court, and had the plea been accepted, it would have been of substantial benefit to the administration of justice in New South Wales.
67There has been a long practice in this Court, sanctioned by much authority, that upon sentencing, a judge should take into account an offer to plead guilty which matches the crime for which the individual is ultimately convicted: R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 at [15]; R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 at [37]-[43]; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32].
68Such an approach seems to me to accord with the incentive and the public interest benefit which underlay the legislative provision of a discount for an early plea: see Thomson at [115] and [122] per Spigelman CJ.
69Accordingly, I am satisfied by the application of ordinary sentencing principles, that in this case it is appropriate to allow 25 per cent discount for Mr Cook's offer to plead guilty to manslaughter and to his subsequent plea of guilty to that offence.  The Crown agreed that such a discount was appropriate.
Victim Impact Statements70The effect which Mr Cook's conduct has had on Mr Burrows' family, has been expressed in statements in Court by Mrs Christine Burrows, Mr Burrows' mother, and also by Ms Teigan Burrows and Ms Rhiannon Burrows, the sisters of Mr Burrows.  I acknowledge the contents of these statements.  I express my sympathy to the Burrows family for their tragic loss.
71It is clear that their lives have forever been changed by the events of 30 October 2010.  I hope that they will understand, and in time come to accept, that the extent of their grief and loss cannot be used by the Court as the measure for the determination of an appropriate sentence.
72I will have regard, in fixing the appropriate sentence to those statements in the way in which the law allows me: s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.
Sentence73Mr Cook is a relatively young man.  He was of generally good character.  He was reasonably educated and apparently in good employment.  He is intelligent.  His prospects of rehabilitation are good.  They will be enhanced if he continues with his studies whilst in custody and, if upon release, he avoids returning to the social milieu in which he mixed when this offence occurred.
74Since his crime involved the taking of a life, any sentence which I impose must mark out the Court's obligation to protect life and mark its disapproval of any crime in which a life is lost.  General deterrence is, in this case, a matter of importance.
75But it would not be right to crush all hope of rehabilitation, which is a matter to which I must also give proper account.  Mr Cook should have the chance, whilst on parole, to demonstrate that he has reformed.
76Ordinarily, but for the plea of guilty, I would have sentenced Mr Cook to a term of imprisonment of 10 years.  In light of the fact of his offer to plead guilty, and of his eventual plea, that term will be reduced by 25 per cent. So for the offence of manslaughter, taking into account his plea of guilty, he will be sentenced to an overall term of 7 years 6 months.  
77Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires, as a statutory ratio, that Mr Cook should serve three quarters of that term as a non-parole period.  However, in his case, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances which enable me to reduce that non-parole period, thereby increasing the time he is on parole.  
78The special circumstances which I find are the facts that he is still a young and relatively immature man, the fact that this is his first period of incarceration and that he will require a lengthy period of supervision in the community in order to ensure that his rehabilitation has good prospects of success.
79These facts all combine to mean that I should vary the ratio of 75 per cent fixed by the law so that his non-parole period is about 55 per cent of the total sentence, which means that I have decided he should serve a period in custody of 4 years.  That term should commence on 30 October 2010, which is the day he was taken into custody for this offence.
80I am satisfied that such a non-parole period properly reflects the criminality involved in this offence and all of the factors to which I am required to have regard.
Orders81In light of Mr Cook's plea of guilty to the indictment, I convict him of that offence.  
82Mr Cook, I impose the following sentence upon you:
(a)I sentence you to a term of imprisonment without parole of 4 years to commence on 30 October 2010 and to conclude on 29 October 2014.
(b)I sentence you to a balance of term of 3 years 6 months to conclude on 29 April 2018.
(c)The first day on which you will be eligible for release from custody is 29 October 2014.

		11 May 2012",2012-05-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708216,R v Pratten (No 4) [2012] NSWSC 1667,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: In relation to document 29 in Voir Dire Exhibit G, objection is taken on the grounds of relevance, and if the document be relevant, that its unfair prejudice to the accused outweighs its probative value. Of course, unfair prejudice in that sense means the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The unfair prejudice to which the accused points is the prejudice associated with ownership of a vehicle, which might give the impression that the accused was well-to-do, in circumstances where otherwise the evidence might show that his income was small or less than one would normally associate with the ownership of a luxury vehicle.
	
	
	It seems to me, the first question really is the relevance question. If the material is not relevant, then one does not reach consideration of s 137 of theEvidence Act 1995, or indeed s 135, if there is work for s 135 to do.
	
	
	The documents, together with other material, disclose, firstly, a lack of strict adherence to the corporate identities, which are said to own or pay expenses of equipment used by Mr Pratten; and, secondly, it is said by the Crown, the ownership by one of the corporate entities of something to which Mr Pratten is entitled as a benefit, which the Crown says leads inexorably to the proposition that it was of value that ought to have been declared as income.
	
	
	It is unnecessary for the Court to comment on the last aspect of that proposition. It seems to me the Crown case as a whole is based upon the proposition that equipment owned or operated by associated private companies of an individual, and used by the individual, is a benefit that must be declared as income. If that be right, and, as I said, I am not going to comment on it, then this material is relevant to that proposition. It is also relevant, it seems to me, to the lack of strict adherence to corporate separation, which perhaps goes to the same issue, although may be exculpatory. I think if it be exculpatory, it would not render it irrelevant. On the contrary, it might make it more relevant. Therefore, I consider that the documents behind tab 29 are relevant.
	
	
	As to the danger of unfair prejudice, it seems to me that the probative value of the material is not particularly high, but the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused must take into account the directions that might be given by the judge to the jury on these issues, and I consider that the danger of unfair prejudice in that light is very small.
	
	
	I do not consider in those circumstances that the probative value of the material is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, and I would rule it admissible.

2708225,Da Silva v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 106,"Judgment
Ex tempore judgment on application pursuant to Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act  2010 (NSW)
1WHEALY JA:  There is before the Court an application by the NSW Commissioner of Police made pursuant to ss 7 and 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW).  The application is sought to prevent the publication of evidence in proceedings in this Court today.  That evidence takes two forms.  First, the precise evidence is contained in a record of interview given by Mr Roy Da Silva on 10 August 2011, in particular, questions 54 to 58 of that interview where he described an amount of money given to him pursuant to what I will loosely describe as a ""reward"" application for giving evidence.  It appears to be not uncommon that, in appropriate cases, police are entitled to apply for a monetary reward on behalf of a witness.  Such 'rewards' relate to the preservation of a witness's safety.  Detective Michael Abbott, the police officer in charge of Rodney Da Silva's investigation, explained in an affidavit dated 30 January 2012 that the guidelines for information to be provided to witnesses is contained within New South Wales Police Force Policy.
2Secondly, the application extends to protect by a non-publication order  any mention in the evidence before this Court today, or otherwise in any judgment given by this Court or an argument in Court, as to the precise amount of the reward.  The grounds of the application are contained in the affidavit of Commissioner Peter Barrie.  In order for the application to succeed, the Court must be satisfied that the order sought is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice:  s 8 of the Act.
3Commissioner Barrie, in paragraphs 13 and 14 of his affidavit, confirms that the concern of the police is that publication of this information will indirectly reveal police methodology with regard to the value placed on specific types of information in the granting of rewards.  This may, if known, compromise future investigations, according to Commissioner Barrie.  It may also create an expectation in potential sources that they should receive a specific amount of money.  It may encourage witnesses not to provide information unless a reward is offered and, in particular, a specific reward is offered.  In paragraph 14, Commissioner Barrie makes the further point that if this information were publicly known, it may lead to existing sources becoming dissatisfied with the amount of money awarded to them, and may deter them from continuing to assist police.
4Each of those matters, in my opinion, satisfies the requirements of s 8(1)(a) of the Act and, for my part, I would be prepared to make an order in the terms of the Short Minutes of Order which have been placed before the Court.  The ground on which the order is made is required to be stated.  As I have indicated, the relevant ground is that contained in s 8(1)(a) of the Act.
5HIDDEN J:  I agree.
6SCHMIDT J:  I agree.

		24 May 2012",2012-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708227,Da Silva v R [2012] NSWCCA 129,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 9 May 2012, this Court heard an appeal by Rodney Rodrigues Da Silva (""the appellant"") against his conviction, and a Crown appeal asserting manifest inadequacy in the sentence imposed upon him.

2At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court made the following orders:

(1)  An order that the time for bringing the applicant's appeal be extended.

(2)  An order that the two convictions against the appellant be set aside.

(3)  An order that there be a new trial on both counts in the indictment.

3Later on the same day, in Chambers, the Court dismissed the Crown appeal against sentence. These are the reasons of the Court for the orders that were made.

The trial

4On 11 November 2009, an indictment was presented against the appellant which contained the following two counts:

(1)  On 27 December 2006 at Belmont in the State of New South Wales, being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a shotgun, [he] robbed David Reid of a sum of money, at the property of Belmont North Meats and immediately before such robbery wounded David Reid.

(2)  On 27 December 2006 at Belmont in the State of New South Wales, being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shotgun, robbed Christine Huber of a sum of money, at the property Belmont North Meats.

5The trial ran through until 3 December 2009, when the jury retired to consider its verdict. The next day, it returned verdicts of guilty on both counts.

6The Crown case was that on 27 December 2006 at approximately 3.40am an armed robbery had been carried out at the home of David Reid and Christine Huber. Mr Reid was shot twice, sustaining very serious injuries, and Ms Huber was threatened with a machete. Approximately $20,000 was stolen by the thieves. Two men, Kenneth Penfold and Brendan Ward, had subsequently entered pleas of guilty to offences arising from the home invasion. It was the Crown case that Penfold had waited in the car while Ward and another man entered the home. It was the Crown case that the other man was the appellant and it was he who had carried and discharged the firearm. However, the trial judge, when he came to sentence the appellant, found that this last aspect had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

7The trial judge had given a concise and comprehensive summing up to the jury, including the provision of carefully prepared written directions. These demonstrated that the real issue in the trial was whether the appellant was one of the two men who had invaded the property at Belmont and carried out the robbery and wounding. 

8There was an unusual feature about the trial. Although the Crown relied upon the principles of joint criminal enterprise, it became apparent throughout the trial that the Crown was, in fact, limiting its case to the proposition that the appellant was one of the two men who had been inside the house and carried out the wounding and robbery. The Crown disclaimed any suggestion that it could prove its case by establishing that the appellant was the third man, the driver of the getaway vehicle.

9This came to a head when the jury asked a question following upon their retirement on 3 December 2009. The question was:
""Can, in this case, joint criminal enterprise include a possible third person, the accused, not on the premises, or does the joint criminal enterprise relate only to the two persons in the house with the weapons?""

10His Honour gave the following direction to the jury:
""In this case the Crown asserts that there were three people, Penfold, Ward and the accused. Ward and the accused went inside the premises, did the robbery and were involved in the shooting and the threats with the machete, and that Penfold was outside in his car. It is not open to you in this case to find the accused guilty on the basis that he may possibly have been the person in the car ... The overriding principle is, how has the Crown conducted the case here? You cannot find the accused guilty of this charge if you think that he may have been elsewhere than inside the house, regardless of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. The only way the Crown puts its case here against this accused is that Ward was in the house and that the accused also was.""

11There was a significantly powerful circumstantial case brought by the Crown to suggest that the appellant was involved in some way with the robbery. However, the only evidence that pointed directly to his being one of the two men inside the house and involved in the actual robbery and wounding came, unusually, from the appellant's brother, Roy Rodrigues Da Silva. We shall, in these reasons, refer to the witness by his Christian name as ""Roy"". 

12Roy's evidence was, in essence, that the appellant confessed to him his involvement in the robbery and that he (Roy) saw items that were either used in the robbery, or which might be regarded as the fruits of the robbery, in the appellant's possession.

13The Crown case to suggest that the appellant was one of the two robbers/ assailants in the house rested entirely on whether Roy's oral evidence could be believed beyond reasonable doubt.

14The case for the appellant was presented on the basis that the appellant did not participate in the actual robbery at all. The appellant mounted a substantial case against the credit of his brother, Roy, suggesting that he was acting out of spite and fratricidal hatred towards his elder sibling.

15On 15 January 2007, Roy had been interviewed by police. He did not indicate his older brother in this interview, but at trial said he had not told the truth about his knowledge of the robbery at that time because he was ""sticking up for his brother"".

16On 2 September 2008, however, he made an induced statement to the police which he claimed at trial was a truthful statement.

17The Crown, in its closing submissions to the jury, submitted that the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, having regard to the evidence of Roy, that the appellant had been one of the two men inside the premises at Belmont on 27 December 2006. The defence submissions urged the jury to reject the evidence of Roy, having regard to the poisonous relationship between the two brothers. Defence counsel at trial suggested that Roy's evidence in giving evidence against his brother was to ""sink his brother"". It was put to the jury that, for a number of reasons, the police were treating Roy as ""a protected species"". 

18It is clear from the jury's verdict that they must have accepted the evidence of Roy beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge sentenced the appellant on this basis.

19On 18 June 2010, the appellant was sentenced to an overall sentence of fifteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eleven years.

The appeals

20The Crown appealed against sentence on 13 July 2010. The appellant served his grounds of appeal and supporting submissions upon the Crown on 19 May 2011. A notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on 14 July 2011. As originally framed, the grounds of appeal sought to set aside the verdicts of the jury on the grounds that they were unreasonable, or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. Reference, however, was made to ""the fresh evidence contained within the affidavit of Roger Murray sworn 17 May 2011"". 

21On the hearing of the appeal, Dr Bogan, who appeared for the appellant, informed the Court that the only ground now relied upon was that, as a result of the fresh evidence referred to in Mr Murray's affidavit of 17 May 2011, the verdicts had constituted a miscarriage of justice. The Crown, which had raised questions about the appropriateness of combining an unreasonableness ground with a fresh evidence ground, raised no objection to the revised approach by the appellant.

22The fresh evidence is contained in a letter that was sent from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) dated 13 July 2010. It was sent to the appellant's trial lawyer, Stidwell Solicitors, and received soon after the date bears. The letter was written by Mr Mark Carmody who at that time worked for the ODPP. The letter states:
""I refer to the trial of this offender in the Sydney District Court which commenced on 11 November 2009 and the evidence of the offender's brother, Mr Roy Rodrigues Da Silva. Mr Da Silva was sworn and gave evidence on 18 November 2009 (T245-303).

Pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions' continuing obligation to make full disclosure to the accused of all material known, I advise that Mr Roy Da Silva contacted me by telephone on 1 June 2010 and commented that he was expecting a reward from the police for having given evidence at the trial. He said that he was expecting to receive up to $25,000 and spoke of the police paying for some relocation costs in consequence. He said to me words to the effect: 'The only reason for doing it (giving evidence) was because I was offered a reward'.

After this conversation I made enquires with the Crime Manager, Local Area Command at Lake Macquarie Detectives and was informed that Mr Da Silva was not promised any reward prior to the completion of this matter and was only ever advised, after the completion of the trial that a 'reward' application may be made based on any threats that he may have received in consequence of giving evidence and the need for him to relocate. I was further informed that NSW Police, upon receiving such applications, may make a recommendation to an evaluation committee for such a 'reward' to be paid to suitable applicants. I understand that in this matter, no application for 'reward' has yet been made by or on behalf of Roy Da Silva.""

23It seems that this letter was seen for the first time by the appellant's appeal solicitors (CrimLaw (NSW) Pty Ltd) on 25 February 2011 when it was given to Mr Roger Murray by the appellant at Long Bay Gaol.

24The obvious relevance of the contents of this letter, in so far as it may have had a significant bearing on the credibility of Roy's evidence at trial, is apparent.

Other materials placed before the Court

25By consent, a considerable body of other material was placed before the Court relevant to the fresh evidence. This included two affidavits of Miriam Rottenberg (a solicitor in the employ of the ODPP), an affidavit of Mr Carmody, an affidavit of Roy Da Silva (as an annexure to the first of Ms Rottenberg's affidavits) and an affidavit of Detective Senior Constable Michael Abbott who was in charge of the investigation into the crimes that are the subject of this appeal.

26From all of this material, the following sequence of events is established.

27It appears there were discussions between Detective Senior Constable Abbott and Roy on a number of occasions on or after 18 February 2009, in which there was mention of the possibility of a ""monetary reward"" being applied for and granted. These conversations occurred prior to Roy giving evidence at the trial which, as I have said, commenced on 11 November 2009 and culminated in the convictions on 4 December 2009. The factual contents of these discussions was not disclosed at any time by the ODPP to the defence at trial. It is likely that the ODPP did not have this information itself because it had not been communicated to their office by the police. Detective Abbott's affidavit suggests that these types of conversations were ""standard"" and it may well be the position that it simply did not occur to the police that they should make such a disclosure.

28During April 2010, prior to the sentencing hearing, Detective Abbott had further discussions with Roy in which ""precise"" or ""exact"" amounts were discussed with him. On 1 June 2010, Mr Carmody had received the telephone call from Roy which is recorded in his letter of 13 July 2010. The contents of this call were not communicated to the trial lawyers until 13 July, some weeks after the date when sentence was imposed on the appellant (18 June 2010).

29On 13 July 2010, there was a further call between Mr Carmody and Roy. On this occasion, according to the file note, Roy said:
""Roy still has not received his $9,000 (seized by police in 2007 search warrant) and his witness expenses.

He has also mentioned the 'reward' that he had mentioned in a conversation with me on 1 June 2010 but was clearly of the understanding that it was not something that he was certain to receive and that it was subject to approval by a police panel.

Roy also mentioned that he is struggling with stress related issues given that he had given evidence against his brother and that he had lost his relationship with his family as a result.

I undertook to ask the police about the $9,000 and witness expenses and make some enquiries regarding counselling.""

30On 16 July 2010, Roy was shot by one Michael Rae on a public street in Newcastle. It seems there had been bad blood between Mr Rae and Roy for some time, and it is possible that one aspect of this enmity related to Roy's giving evidence against his brother. Whether that be so or not, it seems that on the following day the police arranged for Roy to complete an application for reward. Detective Abbott made the application for the witness to be paid an amount of money and this was presented to a panel which determined the ultimate amount.

31On 20 December 2010, Detective Abbott gave a cheque to Roy which represented relocation costs and, presumably, a reward. Detective Abbott stated in his affidavit:
""Payments made to witnesses are standard practice in certain circumstances. The payment and amount of money paid to Roy Da Silva followed guidelines set out in NSW Police Force Policy.""

32Ms Rottenberg wrote to Detective Inspector David Waddell on 23 June 2011 and requested that an independent police officer interview Roy, and that Roy, in turn, adopt the transcript of that interview by way of annexure to an affidavit. Thus it was that Roy swore an affidavit on 20 September 2011 annexing transcript of an interview that was held with him by two police officers on 10 August 2011.

33It is not necessary to go to the detail of the interview. However, it reveals that Roy was paid a considerable sum of money as a reward, which included an amount for his out of pocket expenses in moving. He was asked about the conversation he had with Mr Carmody on 1 June. He denied that the conversation related to ""the reward from Detective Abbott"". He denied saying that the only reason he had given evidence was because he had been offered a reward. He maintained that, during the course of the trial, he was unaware that he would get any monetary reward.

34Roy maintained, during the interview, that the first time Detective Abbott had spoken to him concerning a reward was after the appellant was sentenced. He said that Detective Abbott had never promised him any reward prior to or during the trial. He maintained his reason for giving the induced statement was ""to tell the truth"" and he concluded the interview with these remarks:
""I've never been offered a reward to do anything, like, to go against me brother. Me brother was found guilty. Like, I just want to do the right thing, that's all I wanted to do was tell the truth and I did it, I didn't do it for greed, I didn't do it for anything else. That's the only reason I wanted to do it, set a good example for my son and I'd do it again, you know, if I didn't get anything. I'd go through the whole trial again for nothing, you know.""

35I should add that there was a further affidavit from Mr Murray which dealt with the application for extension of time. There is no need for me to refer to it. The Court was satisfied that an extension of time should be granted in the circumstances outlined in Mr Murray's second affidavit.

The effect of the fresh evidence

36The Court was of the view that the evidence disclosed in Mr Murray's affidavit was ""fresh evidence"" in the sense that it was evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Significantly, the fact that there had been discussions between the police and Roy regarding monetary reward was not disclosed to the defence at the trial, and the remarks by the appellant's brother to Mr Carmody on 1 June 2010 occurred well after the verdicts of guilty had been returned. The content of this conversation was not disclosed to the defence until after the sentences had been imposed.

37In these circumstances, the application of the principles applicable to the receipt of fresh evidence on appeal satisfied us that the conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered.

38Those principles are conveniently set forth in Kirby J's decision in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417, at [63]:
""The authorities in respect of fresh evidence have recently been collected and analysed by Giles JA in R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227, and Heydon JA in R v M [2002] NSWCCA 66 at paras 61-64; see also R v Sleiman [2003] NSWCCA 231 paras 101-105. The test was stated by Barwick CJ in Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 518-520 (McTiernan, Stephen and Jacob JJ agreeing). It was reaffirmed in Lawless v R (1979) 142 CLR 659 by Mason J at 674-5 (Barwick CJ and Aiken J agreeing). The principles may be summarised as follows:

-  First, a distinction is made between 'new evidence' and 'fresh evidence'. Fresh evidence is evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence.

-  Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial (Ratten v R (above) per Barwick CJ at 512).

-  Third, the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v R (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301).

-  Fourth, the issue of whether there has been a miscarriage is to be approached on a number of levels, depending upon the order sought (whether a verdict of acquittal or a new trial), and the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the order sought.

-  Fifth, where a verdict of acquittal is sought and the new evidence is of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the guilty verdict will be quashed and the appellant discharged. In such circumstances, it does not matter whether the evidence is fresh or simply new (Ratten v R (above) Barwick CJ at 518/519; cf Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 398/399).

-  Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively:

    -  Is the evidence fresh?

    -  If it is, is it 'credible' or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v R (above) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or 'plausible' (Mickelberg v R (above) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?

    -  If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v R (above) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v R (above) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v R (above) per Toohey & Gaudron JJ at 301-302.

-  Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth (cf an Inquiry under s 474D Crimes Act 1900). It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of a criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better (Ratten v R (above) at 517).""

39Here, it may be accepted that the quality of the fresh evidence was not such as to satisfy the Court that a reasonable doubt should be held as to the guilt of the appellant. However, it is clear that the evidence was well capable of belief (even though it may be accepted that Mr Carmody did not keep a verbatim note of what was said) and, in the context of the issues at trial, was likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt.

40As we have said, the central issue at trial was whether the appellant was one of the two men who actually carried out the wounding and robbery in the Belmont house. Had the jury known that the testimony of the appellant's brother was coloured by a later assertion that he gave the evidence only because he had been offered a reward, there may well have arisen a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence. We consider that unless a new trial is ordered, there will have been a miscarriage of justice.

41We accept, of course, as the Crown argued, that there may be other ways of looking at the statement said to have been made by Roy to Mr Carmody. If he did use the words attributed to him, he may have been intending to convey that he had decided to attend as a witness at trial because the prospect of receiving a possible reward outweighed his fears and concerns for his own safety as a witness. In other words, the statement may not have been intended to refer to his original decision to provide an induced statement to the police. Secondly, as the Crown suggested, it may be that the second conversation on 13 July 2010, to some degree, took the edge off the bluntness of the first statement.

42These are quintessentially jury questions. We consider that they are appropriate for resolution by a jury rather than by this Court. From our perspective, had the jury been confronted with an assertion that the appellant's brother gave evidence to obtain a reward, there would be a significant possibility that a jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellant.

43The Crown took the Court through a brief summary of the detailed circumstantial case against the accused. As we have said, this forcefully suggested that the accused had an involvement in the offences but did not, absent his brother's evidence, place him within the house at the time the robbery and wounding took place.

44Because we have formed the view that the conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered, we considered it inappropriate to proceed with the Crown appeal against sentence and it was dismissed, as we have said, in Chambers. It is not appropriate for us to express any opinion about the merits of that appeal or otherwise to make any comment upon it.

		05 December 2014",2012-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708233,R v Murrell [2012] NSWCCA 90,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J : The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the sentences imposed on the respondent, Aaron Leigh Murrell, on 25 February 2011, in respect of a robbery in company offence (s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900) and a count of aggravated break and enter and intimidate whilst armed with an offensive weapon (s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (1900). The former offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The latter offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and carries a standard non parole period of 5 years. 

3There were two further offences taken into account on a Form 1 when the respondent was sentenced for the aggravated break and enter. Those two charges consisted of possessing a prohibited drug (a small quantity of methylamphetamine) and possessing equipment to administer a prohibited drug, being a ""crack pipe"". 

4The respondent was sentenced to a non parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 2 years on the robbery in company charge. Taking into account the offences on the Form 1, the respondent was sentenced on the aggravated break and enter offence to a non parole period of 2 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months. The effective non-parole period was 3 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months. 

5The sentence for the aggravated break and enter offence was accumulated upon the sentence for the robbery offence to the extent of one year. No issue is taken with that exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, there was a degree of concurrency between the aggregated sentences for these offences and sentences which the respondent was already serving for unrelated offences. The Crown takes issue with this aspect of the overall sentence.

The Robbery in Company Offence 

6On 5 June 2009, two employees of a company known as STFO Trading were selling home theatre systems and LCD products from the back of a van. In the morning of that day, they drove to Ingleburn shopping centre where they approached the respondent. 

7The respondent asked the two men to drive him to his house so he could obtain money for payment. The respondent directed them to a location in Minto. In the course of the journey the respondent spoke on the phone to an unknown person, instructing him to ""walk down the street"". 

8When the van parked in Sutton place, a co-offender, Bazzi, walked over to the van in the middle of the street. The respondent got out of the van and went into nearby premises. On his return, the respondent insisted that the transaction take place further down the street near a park. At this point, the respondent was carrying a black case similar to a CD case. 

9The men drove the van to the park as directed. One of the men got out of the van and opened a sliding door. That man and the respondent entered the van, where the respondent produced a small black pistol from the CD case. The respondent pointed the pistol at the victim and told him to get everything out of the van. He also demanded that the victim remove a bracelet. The victim removed a quantity of equipment from the van and placed it on the ground.

10Meanwhile, the co-offender demanded the driver's identification, saying ""I know where you live. If you call the cops I'm going to kill you and your family."" The respondent told the co-offender to grab the keys but before he could do so, both victims entered the van and accelerated away. The respondent grabbed onto the door frame but was fought off by the passenger and fell from the vehicle. 

11The victims immediately reported the matter to police. The respondent's bum bag was found on the front seat of the van. It contained credit cards and a driver's licence in the respondent's name. He was arrested on 5 June 2009 and granted bail the following day. 

The Aggravated Break and Enter Offence. 

12Shortly after midnight on 9 March 2010, three males (including the respondent) forcibly entered residential premises in Austinmeer. The house was occupied by two adults and their two young children. The adult victims woke to the crashing sound of the front door being broken. They were confronted in the bedroom by the three intruders, each armed with weapons, namely, an axe handle, a sledgehammer and a small hammer respectively. The offenders were wearing dark clothing and balaclavas. 

13The female victim was slapped by one of the intruders and a demand was made for property. The offenders received $600 in cash and two jewellery boxes. They then demanded the keys to the victims' car. The victims' 10-month-old baby began to cry and the female victim was permitted to collect the child from the bedroom in order to comfort him. At this point, one of the offenders threatened the male victim with the axe handle, saying ""you're lucky your baby is here"". This conduct constituted the aggravating feature of intimidation. 

14The offenders took a laptop computer, an Apple iTouch and a mobile phone. Two of the offenders stood over the victims in the lounge room while the third offender went to the victims' car. Before leaving the house, the land line phone was taken from the wall of the bedroom.

15The next day, the victims' car was found and examined. A receipt dropped by one of the offenders inside the house bore a fingerprint that matched the prints of the respondent. It was a receipt recording a transaction on the respondent's credit union account.

16The respondent was arrested on 2 July 2010. He was in possession of the methylamphetamine and the crack pipe, the subject of the Form 1 offences.

The Respondent's Criminal History and Subjective Circumstances

17The respondent's criminal history commences in 2004 with a driving offence and continues in 2005 and 2006 with property offences. 

18In June 2008, the respondent received his first sentence of imprisonment for the offence of take or detain a person with intent to obtain an advantage. A total term of 16 months imprisonment was imposed, including a non parole period of 8 months. The respondent was also sentenced to an aggregate term of 9 months imprisonment for a number of offences, including contravene domestic violence order and offences for which he had previously received suspended sentences, which were breached. These sentences were entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for the take or detain offence.

19Following the commission of the robbery offence on 5 June 2009, the respondent received the benefit of further suspended terms of imprisonment for 2 offences relating to the introduction of a syringe and a poison into a place of detention. The commission of the break and enter offence on 9 March 2010 constituted a breach of these suspended sentences.

20As a result of the call up on these offences, the respondent received fixed terms of 6 months imprisonment commencing 2 July 2010 and a term of 12 months imprisonment commencing 2 October 2010, including a non parole period of 7 months, for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence. 

21The judge in the instant matter commenced the sentences on 28 December 2010, that is, 6 months into the sentences the respondent was already serving. This resulted in an effective total sentence of 7 years and 6 months, with a continuous period of custody of 4 years, representing the criminality inherent in the robbery, the detention centre offences, the break and enter, and the assault offence. 

22Against this background, it would seem that the respondent has not learnt from past extensions of leniency. This was a factor to which his Honour had regard, but the respondent's personal circumstances over the period of offending from 2008 to 2010, including his youth, played a significant part in the judge's assessment of the respondent's moral culpability. 

23The judge noted that the respondent had a dysfunctional upbringing, owing to a level of domestic violence within the home, frequent changes in accommodation, his mother's alcoholism and her departure from the family home when he was about six to eight years old (1993-1995). The respondent had a number of paternal uncles who ""were enmeshed in the crime milieu"" and who influenced the respondent in the absence of any supervision from his father, principally from the year 2000 onwards, when his father first developed cancer. 

24When his mother left the family home, the respondent remained living with his father until his father's death in April 2010. Over the course of his father's illness, there were periods of time when the respondent was largely responsible for his father's care, which was complicated by a brain injury suffered by his father in a motor vehicle accident in 2008. As a result of that accident, his father became aggressive and abusive, rendering the respondent's responsibilities even more onerous. The respondent received the assistance of his aunt in that regard. The respondent's expulsion from high school in year 7 resulted in a limited work history.

25The respondent started using alcohol and cannabis at 14 years of age. By the age of 18 he was using ice on a daily basis and was also abusing steroids, speed and ecstasy. There were some periods of abstinence but the respondent would relapse on a regular basis because of his inability to cope with his father's illness.

The Grounds of Appeal.

26The grounds as filed were :-
(1)His Honour erred by finding that the objective seriousness of the aggravated break and enter offence was ""just"" above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
(2)If the judge was not in error as asserted in ground 1, then the sentence for the aggravated break and enter offence did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of that offence, nor was it consistent with the judge's finding that the objective seriousness was ""just"" above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
(3)The judge erred in the extent to which he reduced the non-parole period to reflect the finding of special circumstances.
(4)The sentence for the robbery in company offence did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of that offence.
(5)The judge erred in his approach to accumulation and totality.
(6)The sentences were manifestly inadequate.

27On the hearing of the appeal, in recognition of the High Court's decision in Muldrock v the Queen [2011] HCA 39, ground 1 was abandoned and ground 2 was amended to :-
(2)The sentence for the aggravated break and enter offence did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of that offence.

28Grounds 2 and 3 were said to be related. That is so, given that ground 3 was argued in terms of the non-parole period failing to reflect the objective gravity of the section 112 (2) offence.

29Ground 4 replicates the complaint in the amended ground 2 in respect of the robbery offence, and maintains that the judge paid inadequate attention to the guideline judgement in Henry.

30Ground 5 also replicates ground 3 in respect of the robbery offence, in that it asserts an excessive degree of partial concurrency of the sentence for the robbery offence with sentences the respondent was already serving. That degree of concurrency produced an effective non-parole period of 8 months for the robbery offence, which, it is said, fails to reflect the objective gravity of that offence.

31Ground 6 claims that each sentence and the aggregate sentence are manifestly inadequate.

The Assessment of the Objective Gravity of an Offence

32Before embarking on a consideration of these grounds, it is necessary to say something about the developments in sentencing law since the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2005] HCA ; 228 CLR 357.

33The first observation is that there is no difference in approach to the sentencing exercise as between standard non parole period offences and other offences, save that the standard non parole period for Part 4, Division 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 offences operates as a factor additional to other factors under s 21A of the same Act and additional to the maximum penalty for the offence : Muldrock at [26], 1162 ; R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [10] to[13].

34That approach consists of :- 
a complex but unitary (or integrated) process requiring consideration of all relevant factors in quantifying the sentence to be imposed. It is an evaluative assessment ""based on indeterminate standards and human judgment"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [72] (McHugh J).

35Second, as was observed by Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) in Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [45] :-
The High Court did not suggest that a conventional assessment of objective offending, according to a scale of seriousness, was to be avoided: R v Koloamatangi at [18]-[19].

36Further, at [46] and [47] of Zreika :-
Assessment of the objective gravity of an offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]. It is an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis, a purpose of which is the imposition of a proportionate sentence, which adequately punishes an offender: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
The judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen has left somewhat opaque the meaning of the term ""objective seriousness"": R v Koloamatangi at [19]-[21]. Nevertheless, as subsequent decisions of this Court have stated, it remains part of a sentencing Judge's function to consider the objective gravity of the subject crime and the moral culpability of the offender: Ayshow v R at [39]; Sheen v R at [169]. 


37With these principles in mind, I turn to the judge's remarks on sentence and, in particular, his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the offences to the extent that those remarks address that factor.

Grounds 4 and 5 : Objective Gravity of the Robbery Offence.

38With respect to the robbery offence, the judge said :-
In the court's view he decided to commit the offence shortly after meeting the victims. This was a spontaneous decision, however he then recruited the co-offender to assist him and after arriving at the place where the co-offender joined him, he went into the co-offender's house and emerged with the pistol. He had ample time to withdraw from what he had set in place before actually taking the victims' property. The offence was executed without any indication of professionalism. He claims that he was out of his mind on illicit drugs and suffering emotionally due to his father's illness when he committed this offence. However there is no evidence that he did not know what he was doing and did not fully appreciate the consequences of his conduct when he committed the offence. His drug usage and the reason for it explains but does not excuse his offending. The property with the exception of the bracelet was recovered. .........................................
The offender claims that the gun was only plastic and not real, however he raked the slide at the top of the gun which must have led the victim to believe it was a real weapon. There is no physical contact with the victim. The co-offender demanded the victim's identity and made threats in that context if he went to the police. Whilst the victim and his companion suffered no physical injury, no doubt the incident was very frightening for them. It is not uncommon for a victim of an offence like this to be left with long-term emotional and psychological problems.
The presence of two offenders, the gun and the threat means that the Henry guideline has considerable relevance in relation to this matter. However, in the court's view, the victims were not vulnerable. Further, his record is greater than that contemplated by the Henry guideline. In addition, the weapon was not of a type capable of inflicting serious injury. The court has come to this conclusion because of the inability of the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real, as distinct from imitation, weapon.


39Accepting that the respondent was a relatively young man at almost 22 years of age when he committed the robbery and that the Crown could not prove that the weapon was real, the offence nonetheless fell within the guideline of R v Henry & Ors, [1999] NSWCCA 111 as the judge rightly recognised. As the Crown correctly points out, the respondent was in a less favourable position than the theoretical offender in Henry, in that the respondent's criminal history was a significant factor, particularly given that at the time of the robbery offence he was on conditional liberty, having been released on parole on 5 November 2008 for an offence of take and detain for advantage. The respondent was on parole until 5 July 2009.

40That said, it was also correct to take into account the fact that the weapon was not capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, that the offence was unplanned, that the victims were not vulnerable and that the majority of the proceeds of the offence (with the exception of the bracelet) were recovered. These factors allowed for a minor departure from the Henry guideline. 

41In addition, it was necessary for the judge to take into account the sentence imposed on the co-offender on 14 May 2010. The co-offender's criminal history was greater than that of the respondent. As against that, the co-offender did not instigate the offence, did not recruit the respondent and was not armed. The co-offender pleaded guilty at an earlier time resulting in a discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of his plea. The co-offender was of a similar age, addicted to drugs and on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. His Honour Judge Toner imposed a sentence of 3 years and 6 months on the co-offender, including a non-parole period of 2 years.

42Having regard to the principle of parity, and the relevant features of the offence that were absent from those nominated by the Court in Henry, the sentence imposed upon the respondent for the robbery offence was well within the proper exercise of the judge's sentencing discretion. The sentence takes adequate account of the objective gravity of the offence, whilst recognizing the constraints arising out of the length of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender. 

43Moreover, the sentence must be assessed against the need to integrate all relevant factors, including the respondent's subjective case. On this basis, it could not be said that the sentence is manifestly inadequate.

44Separate considerations arise with respect to Ground 5. The Crown's complaint on this ground is that the effective non-parole period for the robbery offence was reduced to eight months, by virtue of the concurrency of the non-parole period with that fixed for the assault occasioning offence and the commencement of the non-parole period for the break and enter offence on 28 December 2011.

45The Crown cited the following passage from the judgment of the Court in R v MAK & MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381 :-

[15] Whenever the Court sentences an offender for multiple offences, including when there are different victims, or sentences an offender who is already serving a sentence after conviction for other offences, it is necessary for the judge to ensure that the aggregation of all of the sentences is a ""just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved"" : Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307 per McHugh J.

[18] A sentencing court must ... take care when applying the totality principle. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of discount for multiple offending : R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at [112]. For similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender who is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no, or little, penalty is imposed for the additional offences. 

46What is missing from the cited passage qualifies this statement to a considerable extent :-

[15] .............. The need to maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a series of offences and the totality of the sentences to be imposed for those offences arises for at least two reasons. 
[16] The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship. That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence. As Malcolm CJ said in R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306: 
... the severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of the sentence. Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year. Similarly, while a sentence of seven years may be appropriate for one set of offences and a sentence of eight years my be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation. Where both sets were committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences.

[17] The second matter that is considered under the totality principle is the proposition that an extremely long total sentence may be 'crushing' upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform. Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.

47The critical question therefore is whether the continuous period of 4 years actual custody strikes an adequate balance between the criminality inherent in the robbery, the detention centre offences, the break and enter, and the assault offence on the one hand, and the potential of a lengthy non-parole period to inhibit or destroy the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation, on the other hand.

48That question can only be answered after grounds 2 and 3 are considered.

Grounds 2 and 3 : Objective Gravity of the s 112(2) Offence.

49The judge's assessment of the objective gravity of the break and enter offence included references to the fact that every aggravating factor under s 105A Crimes Act were established on the evidence in connection with the offence, with the exception of one, inflicting actual bodily harm.

50The judge noted that it would have been open to the Crown to have particularised the serious indictable offence as either steal from the person, robbery, robbery in company or armed robbery. His Honour also noted that the victims were vulnerable in the sense that they were in their own home and in bed when the offenders entered, and they had children in the house. Clearly, they would have been terrified, particularly when one child was in close proximity to the offenders and their weapons. Whilst there was no victim impact statement, the judge accepted that victims of offences such as this were often left with long-term emotional and/or psychological problems. Apart from the car, none of the stolen property was recovered. 

51On the issue of the respondent's role in the offence, his Honour said :-

The offender claims that he just went along with others and the offence was spontaneous. Whilst there is evidence indicating the offence was premeditated, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the offender instigated the offence or participated in its planning. It is unclear which weapon he carried and therefore it is not possible to identify what role he played in the commission of the offence. However he was one of the trio and was present, participating in the joint criminal enterprise which amounted to a serious home invasion. His intoxication at the time, which was probably related to his mark inability to cope with his father's illness and the demands that that placed on him, explains but does not excuse his offending.

52In the result, the judge assessed the objective gravity of this offence ""just above the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". Whilst this assessment was undertaken for the purposes of sentencing law as it then stood, it nonetheless indicates that the offence fell towards the upper end of the range signified by the maximum penalty for the offence. It also remains the case that the standard non parole period has some relevance as a guidepost.

53In addition, the offences on the Form 1 required a modest adjustment to the sentence and some account needed to be taken of the fact that the offence was committed whilst the respondent was on two forms of conditional liberty, namely, bail for the robbery offence and the suspended sentences imposed in October 2009.

54The judge determined that all of these factors, and the respondent's subjective case, called for a sentence of 8 years, to which the 25% discount was applied.

55This offence was, in my opinion, a very serious example of an aggravated break and enter offence. The forced invasion of the home in the middle of the night by three armed men, and the terror inflicted on the occupants, in particular a young child, ought be reflected in the sentence, including the non parole period. A sentence of 8 years before the application of the discount, even allowing for the respondent's youth and troubled adolescence, fails to adequately reflect that objective gravity. 

56Further, a non parole period of 2 years and 6 months represents half of the standard non parole period. The respondent's subjective case was not so powerful as to warrant such a departure from the statutory proportion, even allowing for a head sentence of 6 years. The extent of that departure demonstrates that insufficient attention was paid to the standard non parole period as a relevant factor.

57I would uphold Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal. 

58It follows that an effective non parole period of 4 years for all of the offences referred to in [47] falls considerably short in terms of the total criminality. Had the non parole period for the break and enter offence appropriately marked the objective gravity of that offence, the Crown may have had no cause for complaint. 

Ground 6 : Manifest Inadequacy

59For the above reasons, I do not consider that the Crown has succeeded on this ground with respect to the sentence for the robbery offence. 

60The Crown has succeeded on this ground in respect of the sentence imposed for the break and enter offence, although the degree of manifest inadequacy does not constitute an affront to the administration of justice. I would regard a sentence of 10 years, before the application of a 25% discount, as the least capable of reflecting the objective and subjective factors. 

61I would also uphold this ground in respect of the aggregate sentence of 7 years and the aggregate non parole period of 3 years and 6 months. Accepting accumulation of the sentence for the break and enter offence upon the robbery offence to the extent of 12 months, an aggregate sentence in the order of 9 years might be regarded as lenient, but not manifestly so.

The Residual Discretion.

62It appears settled that s68A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 removes any consideration on the part of this Court of the distress and anxiety that a respondent to a Crown appeal may feel as a result of facing the double jeopardy of a second sentencing exercise. That circumstance is not a factor in the exercise of the residual discretion not to intervene, but it does not extinguish the residual discretion : Green v The Queen ; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [26].

63The majority in the High Court in Green & Quinn stressed that :- 

The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (""Crown appeals"") under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"") is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" [citation omitted] That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient.

64Relevant factors in the exercise of the residual discretion include the extent of the manifest inadequacy and the extent of the respondent's progress towards rehabilitation. Where the erroneous sentence is not ""gross"" or ""vast"", the imperative to interfere in order to correct the sentence, so that the public's confidence in the administration of justice may be maintained, is not so great. Rehabilitative considerations therefore carry some weight in this case. 

65The respondent has, since entering custody, undertaken a number of courses which appear to be capable of providing the respondent, for the first time in his life, with the prospect of gainful employment. He has completed a TAFE course in electronics and started a business administration traineeship. He has also started an IT programme and anticipates that the full course will take approximately 1 year. He has completed two units of a three unit course in occupational health and safety. He is also doing a fitness certificate which will provide him with basic qualifications as a personal trainer.

66The respondent has also undertaken such programmes as are available to him to address his substance abuse and other factors that have predisposed him to offending. He has stable and supportive accommodation available to him on his release with his aunt.

67He will be 28 years of age on his present release date. Any significant increase in the aggregate non parole period will affect the respondent's prospects of obtaining meaningful employment, given that he is presently unable to demonstrate any employment history, even at an unskilled level.

68The respondent's chances of building a normal productive life in the community would not be advanced by imposing a sentence that resulted in his detention beyond the age of 30.

69In the circumstances of this case, I would therefore exercise the residual discretion and dismiss the Crown appeal.

2708235,R v Faridah RASHID [2012] NSWDC 180,"SENTENCE


1I am sentencing Faridah Rashid for the crime of attempting to import cocaine into Australia. It is an unusual case in that what Ms Rashid brought into Australia was nothing but a substance which could be bought quite legally over the counter at a chemist shop. Nevertheless the crime that she has appropriately pleaded guilty to carries a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and for good reason. 

2Briefly what happened is this. Ms Rashid arrived at Sydney airport on 18 September 2011. She was interviewed by Customs officers and denied bringing in any border controlled drugs. She was taken to a hospital and a CT scan revealed what are described in exhibit A as ""foreign objects in her stomach and vagina"". She was asked about what was found and admitted that she had been in prison in 2007 in Argentina for 3 years because she had 2 kilograms of cocaine strapped to her body. She claimed that her husband made her do the drugs - commit that crime and this one. When what were described as the foreign objects were removed, it turned out to be just over 350 grams of diphenylhydramine which is not a prohibited substance. 

3It is convenient at this stage to say a little about what had happened before the Customs officers detected what they found. When Ms Rashid was interviewed she said that she had been offered a job of transporting goods. The job was offered by a man whom she knew as Ocean. She expected to be paid $US10,000 to $US15,000. She was not told what the goods were but she was told that she would get a free holiday. She acknowledged that she was ""desperate for money for her daughter's university enrolment"". She was given $1000 for expenses. She travelled from Singapore, where she lived, to Kuala Lumpur and then travelled on to Paris where she spent a few days until being told by Ocean to travel on to Johannesburg. There she spent a few more days until the people that she spent time with ""brought the pellets to her hotel room"". She said she would take the pellets in her luggage but it was made clear to her, both by words and physically, that she had no choice but to swallow them. She could not swallow them all, so part of the supply was concealed in her vagina. 

4It is important also to say something about an offender who is being sentenced by a judge. Ms Rashid is 40 and she is, as I said, from Singapore. She has 3 children aged 20, 19 and 10. 

5Enquiries by the Australian Federal Police reveal Ms Rashid was arrested by Argentinean Customs officials on 23 November 2007 at an international airport and over four kilograms of cocaine were found strapped to her body. She had a ticket to fly to Spain. She served a sentence and then moved back to Singapore. 

6Ms M Sten who appears for Ms Rashid arranged for her client to see Catherine Wakely, a forensic psychologist. Ms Wakely noted a ""largely uneventful childhood within the context of a close and supportive family"". She had been well educated. As Ms Sten appropriately acknowledged, her client has had relationships with quite undesirable men as far as their illegal activities are concerned. It was noted by Ms Wakely that Ms Rashid's ""children are her primary focus and she is extremely concerned about their education and future"". Indeed Ms Wakely described ""the current offence"" as a ""desperate attempt to secure her daughter's entry to university"". She obviously had elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress which are likely to be accentuated by her separation from her family. Ms Wakely noted ""no indicators of underlying antisocial belief patterns or attitudes"". She also noted that Ms Rashid's ""chances of re-offending should be minimal and she should be in a favourable position to resume a pro social life within her community"". What Ms Wakely was not told was anything about the offence committed by Ms Rashid in Argentina. The reason for that was twofold. One was that the information sent was (without fault of those who sent the information) incomplete. It has since been updated. But the second reason must be of course that Ms Rashid did not disclose that to Ms Wakely. That must affect the weight I put on Ms Wakely's conclusion about her chances of re-offending and her antisocial beliefs, patterns or attitudes. 

7Ms J Petersen, who appears for the prosecutor, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, has set out in her written submissions which are part of exhibit A the factors which I need to take into account. She emphasised the steps which Ms Rashid undertook in order to bring what she thought was cocaine into Australia. She engaged in extensive travel and was prepared, although in the context of some coercion, to swallow twenty-three pellets and carry a further thirteen within her vagina. She undertook an international flight carrying those substances. She had an expectation of being paid a significant amount of money for what she was prepared to do and had received some money towards her expenses. She refused to acknowledge when first asked by the Customs officers that she was carrying anything illegal. 

8Ms Sten emphasised that as soon as the substances were discovered she was fully cooperative and I accept that submission. Ms Rashid pleaded guilty at what Ms Petersen agreed was the first reasonable opportunity and in due course when I impose a sentence I am going to discount the otherwise appropriate sentence by 25 per cent because by pleading guilty Ms Rashid has facilitated the course of justice and has also confirmed her contrition for committing this crime. 

9The maximum penalty which is attached to this crime is 10 years imprisonment. That is by way of a combination of s 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and s 307.3(1) of the same Criminal Code. 

10Ms Sten emphasised what she submitted was an artificial aspect about the crime; what her client in fact imported was innocuous and the one significant aspect of assessing the significance of an importation of cocaine is the percentage of purity. She correctly pointed out that of course in a case such as this the purity cannot be assessed. She also emphasised that but for her client's admissions she would not be facing this court at all. I am inclined to accept that submission, although Ms Petersen pointed out that there would have been a reasonable prospect of conviction without the admission, inviting a jury to infer from the conduct engaged in by Ms Rashid that she must have known that she was importing a border controlled substance. 

11Ms Sten pointed out that her client had disclosed her previous involvement in Argentina. That, I think, does reflect some credit because it was admitted by her early in the piece. On the other hand, of course, as Ms Petersen says, the police would probably have found out but it does demonstrate her early contrition and preparedness to assist with enquiries. 

12When I asked for an explanation of why what Ms Rashid imported was innocuous, Ms Petersen suggested that it was probably of what is colloquially known as a ""rip-off"" whereby somebody who had agreed to sell the drugs to somebody in Australia had substituted the drugs for an innocuous substance and kept whatever profit was agreed. That seems to me to be a reasonable explanation. Ms Sten pointed out that her client also had been duped. She believed that she was likely to gain financially from this. I put little weight on the fact that her client was also deceived. 

13I do take into account that Ms Rashid will be serving a period of custody in a foreign gaol so far as she is concerned and will not have ready access to family and friends. 

14In response to Ms Sten's submission about my not being able to place a percentage of purity on the figure of 350 grams, Ms Petersen pointed to information contained in the agreed facts that the average purity for seizures such as this is roughly between 50 and 85 per cent. However I do think there is some force in Ms Sten's argument that I cannot in fact attribute a purity to this amount. 

15On the other hand as Ms Petersen says - and as the High Court has emphasised - what is important to focus on is what Ms Rashid actually did in committing this crime. That, to me, indicates a degree of sophistication and seriousness. She was not someone who was handed a parcel before she got on the plane. She was someone who was prepared, for a significant amount of money, to travel to several overseas destinations and to have her body used to conceal what she regarded as highly dangerous and toxic substances. I accept Ms Petersen's submission that Ms Rashid played an essential role in the attempted importation of what she believed was a border controlled drug. 

16General deterrence is obviously a very important factor so far as crimes such as this are concerned and specific deterrence is also very important because of Ms Rashid's prior conviction. She is disentitled to any leniency which might be otherwise given to a first offender and I need to place greater emphasis on factors such as retribution, deterrence, personal deterrence and the protection of society. 

17Taking all those factors into account, particularly the steps involved in this crime, I would regard an appropriate penalty as one of 5 years imprisonment. I would discount that by 40 [sic: this seems to be an error and I should have said 25] per cent and fix a penalty of 45 months imprisonment, or 3 years and 9 months. I would regard an appropriate minimum term - to use a general description - as 2 years imprisonment. I take into account, in fixing that 2 years imprisonment as the minimum term, the fact that Ms Rashid will be serving her sentence in an overseas prison. 

HIS HONOUR: Now Ms Petersen I need to sentence and it s 19.

PETERSEN: It's of the Crimes Act.

HIS HONOUR: You don't happen to have a copy, the relevant provisions for sentencing.

PETERSEN: Of the Crimes Act, yes your Honour,

HIS HONOUR: And your submission is a non-parole period rather than recognisance release order?

PETERSEN: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Sten do you want to be heard on that?

STEN: No your Honour.

18I should have added that I regard no other sentence than one of full time imprisonment as appropriate because of the seriousness of the crime. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now Ms Rashid. 

19For the crime of attempting to commit a crime, namely importing a substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, I sentence you to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months. I fix a non-parole period in respect of that sentence of 2 years. The sentence will commence on 18 September 2011 and will conclude on 17 June 2015. The non-parole period commenced on 18 September 2011 and it will expire on 17 September 2013.

HIS HONOUR: Now any matters of fact or law that I should correct that I may have been in error about, whilst I can correct them now. I don't think so, I'm just checking.

PETERSEN: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Sten?

STEN: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now the mathematics, I've got the main sentence of 3 years and 9 months commencing 18 September 2011, concluding 19 [sic: this seems to be an error and I should have said 17] June 2015, and the non-parole period 18 September 2011 to 17 September 2013. Now just carefully check those please, both of you, and tell me.

PETERSEN: I understand them to be correct.

HIS HONOUR: They are correct yes. Ms Sten?

STEN: They are.

HIS HONOUR: Now Ms Petersen, apart from explaining the sentence to Ms Rashid are there any other formal orders that I need to make under the Commonwealth legislation?

PETERSEN: No thank you.

HIS HONOUR: I'll return your Practice thank you.

20Ms Rashid, for this crime I have sentenced you to 3 years and 9 months. That is the sentence which you received. I have backdated it to when you first arrived, 18 September 2011 last year. So your sentence expires on 17 June 2015. I have specified a non-parole period that you must remain in custody of 2 years. That also started last year on 18 September. That will expire on 17 September next year, 2013. At that stage you will be eligible for parole - eligible for parole. Whether you get it or not is not a matter for me but the minimum time that you will be imprisoned is 2 years, until 17 September next year. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else Ms Petersen, Ms Sten?

PETERSEN: No your Honour.

STEN: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I will give my associate the exhibits and the MFI and the indictment. Good luck Ms Rashid, I will now adjourn.

2708239,R v Hakan YUKSEL; R v Yavuz Selim SIRTLAN [2012] NSWCCA 84,"Judgment
1WHEALY JA: I agree with Beech-Jones J and the orders proposed by him.
2BLANCH J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
3BEECH-JONES J:  This is an appeal by the Crown against sentences imposed by Judge Johnstone DCJ.  Each of the two respondents pleaded guilty to an offence of robbery in company with the other under s  97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  For each respondent his Honour also took into account on a ""Form 1"" another offence under s  97(1). Those offences arose out of the same incident but each concerned a different victim.
4His Honour sentenced the respondent Yavuz Sirtlan to a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months.  The ratio between those two periods reflected a finding of special circumstances made by his Honour to which I will return.  His Honour sentenced the respondent Hakan Yuksel to a term of imprisonment of one year and 51 weeks.  The sentence was wholly suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  It was common ground that there was a minor error in the form of each of these sentences.  I address that below.
The Offences
5There was no dispute before his Honour as to the facts surrounding the offences.  At about 3.45 am at Strathfield on 22 January 2011 the two victims commenced walking towards Strathfield Railway Station. They were both young men aged 21.  They were initially harassed by the respondents who were travelling in a car.  The victims kept walking and came to a pedestrian walkway where they were confronted by the respondents. The respondents had alighted from their vehicle and stood directly in front of them within a short-arms distance.
6Sirtlan held a silver-bladed object at waist height in front of one of the victims.  The blade was 8 cm long with a handle concealed in his hand.  It was conceded by the Crown that it could not prove that Yuksel was aware of the bladed object.
7Sirtlan said to the victims ""Give us everything"".  One of the victims handed him his iPhone.  He then pulled his wallet out and started to give Sirtlan the cash within it.  Sirtlan said to him ""You have 5 seconds"" and grabbed his arms.  In fear that victim offered his wallet which contained $10.00 cash, a New South Wales drivers' licence, a Commonwealth Bank of Australia Bankcard and various other personal effects.  Sirtlan snatched the wallet from his hand.
8Yuksel was standing in front of the other victim. In fear for his safety, that victim took out his wallet and showed Yuksel that he only had coins.  Sirtlan reached over and snatched the wallet from his hand.  This wallet contained the victim's drivers' licence, his Commonwealth Bank of Australia Bankcards and $5.00 in coins. Yuksel commenced frisk searching this victim.  He reached into that victim's right trouser pocket and removed his iPhone.
9The respondents left the scene in the vehicle.  One of the victims recorded its registration number and reported it to the police. The vehicle was registered to Sirtlan. The respondents were apprehended the same day. One of the victims identified Yuksel.  Sirtlan was refused bail and remained in custody until sentenced by his Honour on 19 September 2001.  Yuksel obtained bail five days later after being apprehended.  Both pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and were given a 25% discount.
The Respondent Sirtlan
10At the time of the offence Sirtlan was 19 years of age.  He was born in Turkey and came to Australia at a young age.  His Honour recorded that he had a number of convictions for prior offences including assault, robbery armed with an offensive weapon and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  His Honour found that his offending conduct was exacerbated because it was engaged in while he was the subject of a control order and a good behaviour bond.  His Honour noted that his offending behaviour had continued while he had been in prison where he committed offences of assault, fighting, avoiding correctional centre routine, damaging property and defacing a cell.
11A psychiatric report concerning Sirtlan was tendered at the sentencing hearing.  It recorded an incident in year 11 when he was stabbed. It had led to the emergence of a number of psychiatric symptoms.  His Honour accepted the psychiatrist's conclusion that Sirtlan was suffering from a severe depressive condition but that his symptoms had begun to show some signs of amelioration.  His prognosis was said to be positive although it was considered essential that he continue to receive psychiatric treatment.
12Sirtlan gave evidence before His Honour.  He expressed remorse for his actions but his Honour did not accept that he was genuine.  However, his Honour found that there were ""good prospects"" for his rehabilitation although he would require ""a lot of help to overcome his psychiatric problems and his anger management issues"".  On this basis his Honour found that special circumstances existed.
The Respondent Yuksel
13At the time of the offence Yuksel was also 19 years of age.  His criminal record was not as extensive as Sirtlan's, although it included an offence of recklessly wounding while in company.  For that offence he had been sentenced to periodic detention.
14A psychiatrist's report concerning Yuksel was also tendered.  It described an incident a number of years prior where he had been the subject of an assault which had a psychological impact on him.  His Honour accepted that he suffered from a depressive illness in respect of which he required on-going treatment.
15His Honour was persuaded that Yuksel was genuinely remorseful for his conduct.  This finding is contested by the Crown and that challenge is addressed below.  His Honour found that Yuksel had made good progress towards rehabilitating himself.  His behaviour at home had improved and he was in full-time employment.  His Honour found that his prospects of rehabilitation were high.
Crown Appeal:  Sirtlan
16I will first address the grounds of appeal so far as they concern Sirtlan.  Ground 1 of the appeal asserts that his Honour failed to properly consider and apply the guideline judgment of R v Henry  [1999] NSWCCA 111;  (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.  In Henry at [162] Spigelman CJ identified a category of case by reference to seven criteria. This category of case was found to be ""sufficiently common"" to warrant the determination of a sentencing guideline.  At [165] his Honour found that ""sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between 4 and 5 years for the full term"".
17Criteria (vii) identified by Spigelman CJ at [162] of Henry was that there was a ""plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case"".  In R v Kelly [2010] NSWCCA 259 at [52] Kirby J referred to the seventh criteria as assuming a 10% discount for a late plea. His Honour calculated that, if the range of 4 to 5 years stated in Henry was adjusted to a case that involved a discount of 25%, then the adjusted range became one of 3 years to 3 years and 9 months.
18Spigelman CJ described the status of a guideline judgment in Henry at [29] as follows:
""A guideline judgment on the subject of sentencing should not lay down a requirement or anything in the nature of a rule.  The failure to sentence in accordance with the guideline is not itself a ground of appeal.  Guidelines are not rules of universal application.  They may be departed from when the justice of a particular case requires such a departure.""
19Subsequent to the decision in Henry, ss 36 to 42A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act came into force: see R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343;  (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at [38] - [61] (per Spigelman CJ).  These provisions operate to mandate that a guideline judgment be ""taken into account"": Whyte at [63] to [67] (per Spigelman CJ).  However nothing in those provisions or the judgment in Whyte undermines the effect of the passage from Henry at [29], extracted above.
20In his judgment on sentence his Honour stated that the sentences were to be considered ""having regard to the guideline judgment of R v Henry"" and noted the ""features of these offences which correspond with those in the guideline judgment"".  In the case of Sirtlan, the sentence imposed was within the range stated in Henry as adjusted in Kelly. Although Sirtlan's antecedents were worse than that specified in criteria (i) of the category of case referred to by Spigelman CJ (""no or little criminal history""), he had the benefit of a positive finding in relation to the prospects of rehabilitation (""good prospects"") and an incident in his past which warranted some leniency (being the victim of a stabbing).  In those circumstances I do not consider that the Crown has established that his Honour failed to take into account Henry or misapplied it.
21It was further argued on behalf of the Crown that a misapplication of Henry was demonstrated by the imposition of a non-parole period of 18 months. It was submitted that this was a significant variation from the non-parole period that would ordinarily follow from the range identified in Henry as modified in Kelly.  However, the non-parole period of 18 months was determined in the context of a finding of special circumstances.  As counsel for Sirtlan pointed out, there is no challenge by the Crown to that finding.  His Honour's finding in that regard does not reveal any failure to take into account, or misapplication of, Henry.
22I reject ground 1.
23Ground 6 of the appeal concerning Sirtlan (which was also applicable to Yuksel) asserted that his Honour erred by failing to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offence and by giving undue weight to the subjective circumstances of each offender.  
24In his judgment his Honour stated ""these offences were objectively serious although they fall towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness for this type of crime"".  The Crown contends that this was erroneous. It submits that, although there was limited planning for the offence, it was not some chance encounter on a street or train and involved the respondents following the victims in their vehicle.  The Crown pointed to the vulnerability of the victims given that the offences were committed in the early hours of the morning on an isolated street.  It contends that the objective seriousness was increased by the fact that there were two victims.  The Crown submitted that a review of the sentencing judgment reveals that his Honour was overwhelmed by the weight that should be given to the subjective features of the respondents, rather than the objective seriousness of the offence.
25I do not consider that there was any error on his Honour's part in concluding that the offences were objectively serious, but were ""towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness"" or in not making any further findings as to the relative seriousness of the offences.  The Crown's submissions on this topic appeared to assume that a case with the seven features identified in Henry is in the middle range of seriousness for this type of offence. Henry is silent on that topic.  Instead, Henry identified a common category of case for which it was appropriate to establish a guideline.  In that regard, the seven criteria referred to by Spigelman CJ in Henry at [162] travel beyond objective features of the offence and include matters subjective to the offender (see criteria (i) and (vii)). Consistent with the passage from Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27], those are not matters that bear upon an assessment of the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence.
26It is otherwise doubtful whether there was an obligation upon his Honour to undertake some task of classifying the particular offence by reference to it being in the ""low, middle or high range of objective seriousness"" (R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19] per Basten JA;  with whom Adams and Johnson JJ agreed).  In any event the features pointed to by the Crown do not undermine his Honour's assessment.
27I reject ground 6 so far as it concerns Sirtlan.
28Ground 7 contends that his Honour failed to have regard to specific and general deterrence.  In his judgment, his Honour recited s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which refers to those objectives.  His Honour's reference to the ""objectively serious"" nature of the offence and to the judgment in Henry re-enforces that he was completely cognisant of those objectives.
29In my view there is no substance in ground 7.
30Ground 8 contends that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.  The essence of the Crown's submission is that the circumstances surrounding Sirtlan's offence were within the category of case identified in Henry as modified in Kelly with the aggravating factors of his criminal history and the fact that they were committed while he was subject to a bond and a control order.  These points have force but I do not consider that they rise to the level of demonstrating that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate.  I otherwise repeat the comments I have made above in rejecting ground 1.
31I reject ground 8.
32It follows that I consider that the appeal so far as it as concerns Sirtlan should be dismissed.
Crown appeal:  Yuksel
33Grounds 2 and 3 of the Crown's appeal concerned Yuksel.  It was contended that his Honour had failed to have proper regard to R v Henry and erred by imposing a suspended sentence.  These grounds were addressed together.  The essence of the Crown's submission was that, having regard to Henry, the circumstances of Yuksel were such that a suspended sentence was not within a proper sentencing range.  Those circumstances were said to be his criminal record; his lack of insight concerning the impact of the offence on the victims; his attempted minimisation of his role; and the fact that he stood to be sentenced for a further offence in the form 1 involving a separate victim.
34I have described above the manner in which his Honour addressed the judgment in Henry.  In my view Henry had a much diminished significance to the circumstances of Sirtlan.  The common category of case to which Spigelman CJ referred to in Henry at [162] was one involving the use of a ""weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury"".  As I have noted, the Crown conceded that it could not demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that Yuksel was aware that his co-offender was in possession of a knife.  A number of decisions of this Court have emphasised the importance when applying Henry, of the significance of whether or not the relevant offender was armed (or aware that their co-offenders were so armed):  R v Black [2001] NSWCCA 41 at [13] (per James J with whom Whealy JA agreed);  R v Perese [2001] NSWCCA 478;  (2001) 126 A Crim R 508 at [25] (per Hulme J) and at [66] (per McClellan J;  with whom Beazley JA agreed);  and Frahm v R [2009] NSWCCA 249 at [14] - [19].
35It can be accepted that a number of the other factors identified by Spigelman CJ in Henry were present in Yuksel's case. However, given the differentiating factor concerning the presence of a weapon and his Honour's advertence to the decision in Henry I do not consider that there is any error per se that arises from the imposition of a suspended sentence. As with Sirtlan I do not conclude that his Honour failed to take into account or misapplied Henry.
36The balance of the Crown's points under this ground do not in my view demonstrate error on the part of his Honour.  Yuksel's criminal record was not good but his Honour considered that.  The question of his supposed ""lack of insight"" into the impact of the offence on the victims is a matter I will address in relation to ground 4 but, in short, his Honour found to the contrary.  The offence on a form 1 was clearly a matter adverse to him (see Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518;  (2002)  56 NSWLR 146 at [42]).  However, given that the offence on the form 1 related to the same incident as the offence to which Sirtlan pleaded guilty, I do not consider that it was a matter that demanded a sentence of full-time imprisonment.
37In my view, his Honour's finding that the prospects of Yuksel's rehabilitation was high, that he was making good progress in that rehabilitation and that he suffered from a depressive illness in respect of which he required ongoing treatment were the specific features which, when taken with the other circumstances including his lesser role in the offence, meant that his Honour's decision to suspend the sentence was not erroneous.
38I reject grounds 2 and 3.
39Ground 4 contended that his Honour erred in finding that Yuksel was ""genuinely remorseful"". It was contended that that finding was not open on the evidence. Yuksel did not give evidence before his Honour.  The psychiatric report that was tendered on his behalf recorded him as ""feeling deeply ashamed of his behaviour"" and that he ""appeared to be generally contrite and remorseful for his actions"".  A reference from his cousin, a former legal practitioner who later became a financial advisor, recounted that he had spoken with Yuksel and that he was ""ashamed and regretful of his conduct"".  Against this, the probation and parole report recorded that he had ""displayed limited empathy for the victims of the offences and stated he believed they had suffered no harm because they were not injured"".  It further stated that he had ""minimised his involvement and the nature of the offences and indicated he believed the victim had voluntarily surrendered his property"".
40His Honour noted the competing evidence as to his expressions of remorse.  His Honour concluded that ""on balance, in the case of Mr Yuksel I am prepared to accept that he is genuinely remorseful"".
41His Honour was faced with a conflict of the evidence.  I do not see any error on his Honour's part in the manner in which he resolved that conflict.  The resolution of the conflict was undertaken in a context where his Honour received and acted upon evidence which demonstrated that Yuksel had high prospects of rehabilitation and was already making strong efforts towards rehabilitating himself.
42The Crown relied on the comments of Basten JA in R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 at [19] that ""a finding of genuine remorse should not be made lightly, especially in circumstances where there are contra-indications"".  This statement was preceded by the following recitation of the evidence concerning the contrition shown by the offender in that case (at [19]):
""The failure of Mr Thomas to give evidence to that effect himself in the witness box;  his continued adherence, through many days of hearing, to an implausible story which was disbelieved, but constituted a significant attempt to diminish his responsibility for the offence, and the fact that he committed a further serious offence less than a month later, all require consideration in assessing the genuineness of remorse and the extent to which his expression of remorse can mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence.""  
43It is not surprising that these matters caused his Honour to doubt the finding of remorse that appears to have been made by the sentencing judge in that case.  As it turns out Basten JA did not overturn that finding.
44In this case, there is nothing to suggest that the finding of remorse made by his Honour was made ""lightly"" (cf Thomas at [19]). The task of overturning a finding of primary fact on such a matter by a sentencing judge is a difficult one.  The challenge was not made out here.
45I reject ground 4. 
46Ground 5 contends that ""The disparity between the sentence imposed on the respondent Yuksel with that of his co-offender offends parity principles.""
47During argument on this ground I queried whether an asserted disparity between co-offenders is a matter that can be relied on by the Crown as demonstrating error in the absence of any complaint by either co-offender that the sentence gave rise to a ""justifiable sense of grievance"" (Postligione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295). In response the Crown referred the Court to Green v The Queen;  Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49;  (2001) 86 ALJR 1.  At [35] to [46] of Green and Quinn  French CJ, Crennan and Keifel JJ discussed the circumstances in which the Court of Criminal Appeal might refrain from interfering with an otherwise inadequate sentence less such intervention would create a risk of disparity with a sentence imposed upon another offender.  It was thus concerned with the application of the parity principle at the point in a Crown appeal at which the Crown, having established error, seeks the resentencing of a respondent and to defray the exercise of the residual discretion not to intervene.  However, the current case is different.  This ground involves the Crown asserting that there is error per se by reason of the disparity of treatment between co-offenders.  That was not the situation considered in Green and Quinn.
48The difficulty with this ground is highlighted by a concession the Crown made in its written submissions that ""[i]t is acknowledged that the principle of parity should not be used to increase an otherwise appropriate sentence or to disadvantage an offender"" citing R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102;  (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. If that concession is correct then in terms of establishing error this ground goes nowhere. If the sentence is ""otherwise appropriate"" then a lack of parity complained of by the Crown alone should not lead to either offender having their sentence increased. If the sentence is not ""otherwise appropriate"" then error has otherwise been established and the question of disparity need only be addressed at the same point as it arose in Green and Quinn.
49It may be that the discussion in Green and Quin at [28] to [34] provides support for a broader principle that can be invoked by the Crown. It also may be that the existence of a disparity in sentences may point to the existence of some other form of error on the part of the sentencing judge.  However, it is not necessary to express any final views on this for two reasons.
50First, his Honour did not impose sentences that were relevantly disparate in the sense used in the authorities. His Honour stated that ""[i]n terms of parity there are ... considerable differentiating features"" between the two respondents. His Honour was correct to so conclude.  Yuksel's involvement in the offences was less than that of the Sirtlan.  Sirtlan was in possession of a sharp instrument whereas the Crown conceded they could not demonstrate that Yuksel was aware that a weapon was used.  While Yuksel was not a passive participant in the offence, it was Sirtlan who directed the robbery and had the much greater role in threatening the victims.  Yuksel's criminal record was not as extensive as that of Sirtlan.   Sirtlan committed the robbery while he was the subject of a control order and a bond to be of good behaviour.  There were no such restraints applying to Yuksel.  There was a finding of contrition made in the relation to Yuksel.  There was no such finding with Sirtlan.  Yuksel was found to have high prospects of rehabilitation.  Sirtlan was found to only have ""good prospects"" of rehabilitation and he would require help in overcoming his psychiatric problems and anger management issues.
51Second, I have already noted the concession made by the Crown that the principle of parity should not be used to increase an otherwise appropriate sentence.  It follows from my analysis of the remaining grounds of appeal in relation to Yuksel that I consider that he was subject to an ""otherwise appropriate sentence"".
52I reject ground 5.
53Ground 6 of the appeal, so far as it concerns Yuksel, was in the same terms as that concerning Sirtlan, namely, it was contended his Honour failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offence and gave undue weight to the subjective circumstances of the respondents.  I have partly addressed that in dealing with this ground so far as it concerns Sirtlan and I repeat those observations.
54In relation to Yuksel it was contended by the Crown that his Honour only considered the matters personal to him in deciding to suspend his sentence. It was said that his Honour failed to consider the objective circumstances of the offence before concluding a suspended sentence was appropriate (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54;  (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [85] to [86] per Kirby J).  The short answer to this is that, on my reading of the sentencing judgment, his Honour did not so confine himself before concluding that a suspended sentence was appropriate.
55I reject ground 6 so far as it concerns Yuksel.
56Ground 7 has been addressed above in relation to Sirtlan. Those observations apply equally to Yuksel.
57Ground 8 of the appeal so far as it concerns Yuksel asserts that his sentence was manifestly inadequate.  Most of the submissions on this ground have been addressed in rejecting grounds 2 and 3.
58The only additional argument raised with this ground is the suggestion that by imposing a sentence of one year and 51 weeks, his Honour tailored the sentence to allow him to suspend it. This was said to be erroneous because his Honour was required to first give consideration to what a proper sentence should be independently of the question of whether the sentence be suspended (citing R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26] and [30]).  Although expressed in terms of manifest excess this appears to be an assertion of a separate form of error.  While there is some force in the submission I do not think it should be accepted.  Prior to the discussion in the judgment of suspending the sentence, his Honour rejected a submission that the period of imprisonment ""should be as minimal as might qualify him for an intensive correction order"". Having rejected that submission I do not consider that his Honour then adopted the same approach with a suspended sentence.
59Otherwise for the reasons I have outlined in rejecting the other grounds, especially grounds 2 and 3, I do not consider that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.  A suspended sentence can in some circumstances be a ""sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender"" (Zamagias at [32] per Howie J;  with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed).
60I reject ground 8.
Minor Errors
61It was common ground that his Honour erred in selecting a start date for the sentence imposed on Sirtlan which was one day prior to the date of his arrest, ie 21 January 2011, instead of 22 January 2011.  It was also common ground that his Honour erred in fixing a commencement date for Yuksel's suspended sentence when such a date should only be determined if and when a court makes an order under s 99(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  At the hearing of the appeal it was agreed by the parties that, if the Court did not otherwise interfere with the sentences imposed, the appropriate course to deal with these errors was for application to be made to the District Court under s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In light of the conclusion of the Court concerning the appeals it will be necessary for the parties to make that application.
Conclusion
62The orders I propose are: 
(1)The Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on the Respondent Yavuz Selim Sirtlan be dismissed;
(2)The Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on the Respondent Haksan Yuksel be dismissed.

2708243,GOUNDAR v R [2012] NSWCCA 87,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with RS Hulme J and also the additional reasons of RA Hulme J.  In relation to the utility of examining previous decisions to establish a range of sentences, I refer to the following remarks of Barrett JA (made with the concurrence of myself and Tobias AJA) in Lee v Health Care Complaints Commission [2012] NSWCA 80 concerning a submission that disciplinary orders made in one case can and should indicate what disciplinary orders might appropriately be made in another case:
""24   For several reasons, this proposition must be approached with extreme care. Some of the reasons are suggested by discussion of sentencing in criminal cases. In that context, the point is made that, in most instances, a maximum penalty is prescribed by legislation so that there is some fixed starting point from which to consider the exercise of discretion: see, for example, R v Jurisic [1998] NSWSC 423; (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 251. As regards suspension from practice as a medical practitioner, the applicable legislation prescribes no starting point of this kind. If there is a suspension, its duration is entirely a matter for the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion. 
25   The dangers inherent in comparisons, even when such a starting point is available, have been identified in many cases in the sentencing field. In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520, for example, it was noted by French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ (at [54]) that, while a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed, such a history ""does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits"". The range is, however, of significance as a reflection of ""the accumulated experience and wisdom"" of those making sentencing decisions. 
26   Their Honours repeated with approval a statement of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64: (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [59] that a record of sentences imposed in earlier cases 'is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal' and that the production of bare statistics 'tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.'
2RS HULME J:  On 5 November 2010, this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Kirby J to imprisonment for 10 years and 8 months, including a non-parole period of 8 years after a jury had found him guilty of manslaughter of Rajnesh Singh.  He had been charged with murder and the Crown had refused to accept a plea to the lesser charge.
3The circumstances leading up to, and of, the killing of which the Applicant was convicted were described by Kirby J, in terms which were not the subject of challenge, as follows:-
7 On 15 October 2006, the police were called to Plukavec Circuit (where the matrimonial home of the Applicant and his wife Diana was situate) as a result of a domestic argument between Mr Goundar and his wife.  They were called again in November 2006, as a result of a further argument.  On the latter occasion, Mrs Goundar took out an Apprehended Violence Order against her husband.  The order was made on an interim basis by consent.  Mr Goundar moved out of the matrimonial home.  By the terms of the order he was not to approach within 100 metres of the matrimonial home at Plukavec Circuit, nor contact his wife.
8 However, in the months that followed, there was contact between them.  Mr Goundar said that he was still in love with his wife.  She described how he would come to the station before she went to work and often after work.  Occasionally, they spoke on the telephone.
9 By January 2007, according to the offender's brother Mukesh, Mr Goundar appeared to be distressed, withdrawn and ""shattered"".  He was drinking heavily.  Indeed, his brother told him to ""lift his game"".  By mid January, according to Mrs Goundar, both regarded the marriage as over.  Munesh Goundar certainly regarded his marriage as a disaster, but still loved his wife.  Nonetheless, on 22 January 2007, he saw solicitors concerning a divorce and paid $500 toward the cost of obtaining a divorce.
4Prior to the separation of the Applicant and his wife, Mr Singh had been a next door neighbour and a close friend of the Applicant.  On 26 January 2007, the Applicant attended at the former matrimonial home and surprised his wife and, it may be inferred, the deceased as they emerged from that house.  In the words of Kirby J:-
Mr Goundar immediately confronted Rajnesh Singh.  He said words to the effect:-
I'm not stupid.  I know something's going on between the two of you.
Rajnesh Singh denied the accusation.  They began shouting at each other.  Rajnesh Singh accused Mr Goundar of being drunk, and he had been drinking ...
Mr Goundar withdrew and made contact with his brother Mukesh.  Together they went to the new house of the Singh family ...  They appeared to be upset and angry.  They demanded to see Rajnesh ... According to Mr Goundar, Rajnesh Singh's mother came out.  She asked Mr Goundar to forgive her son for what he had done.  It was then that Mr Goundar realised that other members of the community were aware of his wife's affair.
5On the evening of the day before the killing, the Applicant's wife went out to some function.  His parents were there too and after it concluded, they dropped her at the former matrimonial home at about 11.30 pm.  Kirby J's remarks continued:-
19 Mrs Goundar, by this time, had been served with the divorce petition (the Applicant had instigated).  According to telephone records, Mr Goundar attempted to speak with his wife on Saturday 10 February 2007 during the day.  He phoned her again late at night and early the next morning, by which time she was at Plukavec Circuit.  Either at his request, or on her suggestion, he went to the house some time after midnight.  He had been drinking before he arrived.  According to Diana Goundar, they spoke about their divorce.  They agreed that any surplus from the sale of the house, after the repayment of the mortgage, should be evenly divided between them.  On her account, he remained at the house, but slept downstairs.
20 Mr Goundar, however, said that, at some point, he left the house in search of alcohol and cigarettes.  He drove around, but nothing was open, he then took a sleeping tablet and slept in his car.  The sleeping pill had well and truly worn off by the time of the incident and has no relevance to Mr Goundar's state of mind.
21 I accept as more likely Mr Goundar's account of his movements.  At about 5.30 am, he telephoned his wife when he was at Liverpool.  The telephone records also reveal that, during the night, at about 4.20 am, Diana Goundar telephone Rajnesh Singh on three occasions.  The calls were not answered.  At about 4.30 am, she sent a text message to him.  When cross-examined, she said she had no recollection of having made the calls.  She said she had no idea why she would have been attempting to contact Rajnesh Singh at that hour.
22 On the morning of Sunday 11 February 2007, Mr Goundar returned to the house.  According to his wife, the spent the morning and part of the afternoon smoking and drinking in the garage.
23 Rajnesh Singh came to the house at Plukavec Circuit at about 3.40 pm.  The incident which led to his death occurred a short time after his arrival.  Both Diana Goundar and the offender gave evidence concerning the circumstance which led to the attack.  Neither was a satisfactory witness.
6His Honour then summarised some largely conflicting evidence of the Applicant and his wife.  It is sufficient for me to record that it was common ground that the Applicant was in the master bedroom and that Rajnesh Singh and Dianna Goundar went upstairs and entered the bedroom.  The Applicant then attacked Mr Singh with a knife.  The fight moved to an adjacent bathroom and toilet, where Mr Singh ultimately died.  His Honour then continued:-
26 Based on this account, Counsel for the offender urged a finding that, as a matter of probability, Mr Goundar knew nothing of Rajnesh Singh's presence in his home until his wife entered the master bedroom with him.  However, I have no doubt that the offender was aware of the imminent arrival of Rajnesh Singh.  Indeed, two matters, one more compelling than the other, point to a degree of planning in respect of a confrontation which he had in mind.
27 The first was that Munesh Goundar's car was not parked outside the house, as you would expect in a suburban street.  It was out of view.  The offender acknowledged that his car was well known to Rajnesh Singh.  It was damaged and easily recognisable.  He also acknowledged that, had it been parked outside, Rajnesh Singh would not have entered the house.
28 Whilst that evidence is persuasive, compelling evidence was provided by a neighbour, Mr Malcolm Banks, of his observations that afternoon.  It was a rainy day.  Mr Banks was at home watching the cricket.  The cricket was periodically interrupted because of the rain.  From time to time, Mr Banks went outside to smoke a cigarette.  Whilst he was outside, at about 3.15 pm, that is about 20 minutes before Rajnesh Singh's arrival at the house, he noticed a male in the kitchen of the premises next door, that is the Goundar home.  He had previously seen Mrs Goundar, but never a male.  The male was wearing a blue shirt with white pinstripes.  The male reached across to shut the window and pulled down the blinds.  Mr Goundar owned such a shirt.  Indeed, according to the travel agent who booked his airfare to New Zealand on 20 February 2007, he was then wearing a shirt that matched that description.  In contrast, the offender said that he remained upstairs in the master bedroom, drinking and smoking.  He did not go downstairs.  Shutting the window and drawing the blinds was conduct consistent with knowledge of the confrontation which was about to take place.
29 The telephone records disclosed a number of communications between Diana Goundar and Rajnesh Singh on Sunday 11 February 2007, beginning at about 11.00 am (Ex E).  They spoke for some minutes at about 12.30 pm.  They spoke again at 3.22 pm for about four minutes, a conversation which one infers was shortly before the deceased drove his truck from his brother's home to Plukavec Circuit.  Diana Goundar, in her evidence, acknowledged that she had invited Rajnesh Singh to her home.  She also acknowledged that she had not disclosed that her husband was present within the home.
30 I have no doubt that Diana Goundar was asked by her husband to make at least the last of those phone calls and not disclose his presence.  But, was she directed to do so, as she maintained?  I accept that probably she was given such a direction.  Assuming such a direction, the puzzle is why she complied with it.  There was, of course, a history of domestic violence.  An Apprehended Violence Order was in place.  However, whatever the violence, it did not inhibit either party from periodically communicating with each other and seeing each other.  Indeed, as I have described, Diana Goundar permitted her husband to come to the house in the early hours of Sunday 11 February 2007, when she was alone.  Intimidation is therefore not a satisfying [sic] explanation for her conduct.  Was she either culturally or by nature, submissive?  Again, the history of the relationship does not suggest unquestioning submission.  Mrs Goundar acknowledged at least one conversation with Rajnesh Singh that took place at a time when the offender was absent from the home, obtaining a newspaper.  Why then, at least when he was not present, did she not deflect Rajnesh Singh or dissuade him from coming to the home, or at least warn him of Munesh Goundar's presence?  Her conduct was the more extraordinary because she knew that the offender was very drunk.  The puzzle, moreover, does not end there.
7His Honour did not suggest that he found an answer to the puzzle nor why, after Mr Singh arrived and heard noises that emanated from upstairs, Mrs Goundar suggested they came from the neighbours.  His Honour continued:-
32 That statement by Mrs Goundar was, of course, a lie.  The noise was an opportunity for her to apprise Rajnesh Singh of the presence of Munesh Goundar upstairs, to enable him to withdraw.  She failed to take advantage of that opportunity.  Instead, when Rajnesh Singh suggested that they should go upstairs, plainly with a view to making love, she got up and ascended the stairs with him, entering the main bedroom, where she knew her husband was waiting ...
8His Honour then referred to some evidence of Mrs Goundar denying that she knew there would be a confrontation, saying that such evidence was impossible to comprehend and continued:-
35 Mr Goundar suggested that Rajnesh Singh had his hands on Diana Goundar's waist as they entered the bedroom.  I accept that was likely ...  I accept that, consistent with the jury verdict, the confrontation planned by the offender did not include the use of a knife, or the infliction of grievous bodily harm.  Indeed, it appears the confrontation began with a fight.  The police, when they subsequently searched the bedroom, found a number of knives.  I accept that Munesh Goundar, in the course of the fight, lost his self control.  He took hold of a knife from within the room, which he used to repeatedly stab Rajnesh Singh.  As he did so, he said words to the effect:  'You betrayed me.  I was your friend.  I was your brother.'  Rajnesh Singh responded by screaming 'I'm already dead.  I'm already dead' ...
36 Having stabbed Rajnesh Singh repeatedly in the stomach whilst in the bedroom, the offender took him to the bathroom/toilet which was adjacent.  He then stabbed him again a number of times in the back.
9When his Honour came to deal with the issue of provocation he said:-
59  Counsel for Mr Goundar pointed to a number of circumstances relevant to the degree of provocation. The offender regarded Rajnesh Singh as a friend, probably his best friend. Immediately before the confrontation, Rajnesh Singh entered the matrimonial bedroom with his hands on the waist of Mr Goundar's wife. I accept that the offender believed that Rajnesh Singh intended to have sexual intercourse with his wife. I also accept that the provocation was probably magnified by cultural factors. The victim's brother gave the following evidence: (T 65) 
""Q. Because it's considered to be, and one can assume it is considered to be insulting in anybody's culture, but in the Fijian community, the Fijian/Indian community, sleeping with somebody's (wife) is considered to be very, very insulting; isn't it?A. Yes.""
60 Mr Goundar's mental state at the time of these events is also material. I accept that probably he was suffering from an adjustment disorder and depression. He certainly was significantly affected by alcohol and these matters, in combination, no doubt coloured his perception. 
61 It was submitted, in these circumstances, that the provocation was ""very high"". I accept that the circumstances identified were certainly provocative. Nonetheless, it must also be recognised that the victim was unaware of the presence of Mr Goundar within the bedroom. Mr Goundar, on the other hand, was aware of the imminent arrival of Rajnesh Singh. This was not an attack at the time that Mr Goundar first suspected his wife's infidelity. It will be remembered that he had confronted his wife and Rajnesh Singh some weeks before, on 26 January 2007, when they emerged together from the matrimonial home. The incident leading to the loss of self control occurred some weeks later, in the course of a planned confrontation. In that context, the words of Allen J in R v Khan (1996) 86 A Crim R 552 are apposite. His Honour said this, in a case where a husband, suspecting his wife of adultery, lay in wait and ultimately stabbed her lover: (at 557) 
'... Nevertheless the respondent had far more time than often is the case in tragedies of this type within which to prepare himself to cope with the provocation without resorting to the taking of human life. That is relevant to sentencing.'
62 The second issue arising under provocation, concerned the time between the provocative conduct and the loss of self control. Here, I accept that there was very little time between Rajnesh Singh entering the bedroom and the attack. In that short interval, Mr Goundar lost his self control, that is, his power to think rationally and sensibly, took up the knife and began stabbing the victim. 
63 The third matter concerns the degree of violence or aggression, after the loss of self control. Dr Botterill identified three definite stab wounds to the front of the victim. There were two further wounds, which he believed were stab wounds because there were boney defects to the spine. Dr Bennett, an expert in textiles and fibres, examined the clothing of the deceased. She identified damage to the front and back of his T-shirt, consistent with the penetration of a knife in five areas (T 91/3). There can be no question that he was stabbed at least five times. 
64 On any view, this was a ferocious and sustained attack. I have inferred an intention to kill. A number of the wounds were inflicted in the bedroom. The deceased cried out: 'I'm already dead. I'm already dead' (T137). Still the attack continued. The victim was moved to the toilet/bathroom, where he was stabbed again in the back by deep penetrating wounds. 
10His Honour then referred to four matters that he regarded as circumstances of aggravation, viz. the use of a knife, the fact that the offence had been committed in company by reason of the complicity of Diana Goudar, the fact that at the time of the offence the Applicant was on bail, and the circumstances of the dumping of the deceased's body.  His Honour concluded that the Applicant's offence ""was well above the midrange"" and ""was a serious case of manslaughter by provocation"".   His Honour arrived at the sentence he imposed by adopting a starting point of 13 years and discounting this by 17½% for the Applicant's plea.  As has been said, the sentence imposed was imprisonment for 10 years and 8 months, including a non-parole period of 8 years.  The maximum penalty prescribed for manslaughter is 25 years. 
11The grounds of appeal are:-
1. His Honour erred in finding that the Applicant planned the confrontation with the victim, which led to his death.
2. His Honour erred in that he failed to make that finding beyond reasonable doubt.
3. His Honour erred in-
(a) failing to make a finding about the degree of provocation caused by the conduct of the victim towards or affecting the Applicant; or
(b) failing to find that the degree of provocation was high.
4. His Honour erred in finding that the offence was well above the midrange.
5. The sentence was manifestly excessive.
Ground 1
12In support of this ground, counsel for the Applicant attacked both of the matters which his Honour said at [26] pointed to a degree of planning in respect of a confrontation. In respect of the location in which the Applicant parked the car, reference was made to evidence from the Applicant that ""(t)here were heaps of cars there (Plukavec Circuit) so I left it there"" and ""in full view of Mr Singh"".  It was pointed out that there was no evidence about the number of cars parked in Plukavec Circuit at the relevant time, that the street may have been filled with cars, that there was evidence that the Applicant had drunk considerable quantities of alcohol and a sleeping pill before he parked his car and thus the Applicant may have parked in a side street for reasons entirely unrelated to the deceased.  
13However, the Applicant's evidence just referred to that, ""there was heaps of cars there so I parked it there"" (emphasis added) is inconsistent with the proposition that the street was so full that there was no room to park in Plukavec Circuit and justifies the rejection of the first of these theories.  The second submission suffers from the disadvantage that the Applicant, who was in the best position to know, provided no support for it.  Furthermore, there was uncontradicted evidence from a Dr Martin, called on behalf of the Applicant, to the effect that the sleeping pill that had been prescribed for the Applicant could be expected to work within half an hour and its effects should have worn off within 4 hours.  
14The Applicant gave evidence that, after leaving the matrimonial home during the evening of 10 February to acquire some cigarettes and more beer, drinking some he had taken with him, then taking a sleeping pill during the hours of darkness, he went to sleep and later bought more beer and was drinking it in his car before he returned to the former matrimonial home in daylight  - T281.9, T295.2, T313.8.   Certainly, his evidence indicated that he had ingested a considerable quantity of alcohol but provides no basis for concluding that he parked in the side street for a reason other than that which Kirby J inferred.
15A further submission made on behalf of the Applicant in this connection was that the parking of the car in a side street could not be used to support a conclusion that the confrontation was planned, unless his Honour concluded that at the time of parking the Applicant knew that the victim was coming to the home and in fact this was not arranged until later.  The submission is fallacious.  The fact that the victim was not contacted until later does not mean that there was not, earlier, a plan to have him attend if he would.  After all, some of Mrs Goundar's calls to the victim, calls which she did not explain, were prior to the Applicant parking his car.
16So far as the second matter to which his Honour referred is concerned, attention was directed to the terms of Mr Banks' evidence of an observation he made at about 3.15 which was:-
On the occasion I was outside having a cigarette again, and I had actually - I was still looking at the windows and the actual door to the laundry where I was standing banged against the brickwork.  Then I grabbed the door handle and as I did, I say (sic) a male person come across and put his hand to the window to shut the window and also to shut the blinds. 
17It was submitted that this was not unequivocal evidence that the Applicant actually shut the windows and blinds and in any event reasonable explanations for any shutting of the windows were that it was raining, that the Applicant was in the habit of shutting the windows and blinds, and that Mrs Goundar might have asked him to.  There was evidence from the Applicant and his wife that it was raining at times that day and before the evidence just quoted, Mr Banks had said that when he went outside for an earlier cigarette, it had been raining.  Mr Banks also said that the windows of the former matrimonial home were normally closed.
18What Mr Banks said may not be unequivocal evidence that the Applicant actually shut the windows and blinds but Kirby J was entitled to rely on common experience that when people put their hands to windows or blinds in order to shut them, they normally complete the task.  So far as the other suggested explanations are concerned, the Applicant said that he closed no windows that day and it was implicit in Mr Banks' evidence that, on the earlier occasion when he had observed the Applicant and at a time when Mr Banks' evidence makes clear that it was raining, the Applicant had not closed the windows. 
19Relevant to his Honour's conclusion was also the evidence of Diana Goundar about which his Honour had ""no doubt"", that the Applicant had requested her to ring the deceased.  It was submitted that, in view of his Honour's remark that Mrs Goundar was not a satisfactory witness and many of her answers supported this view, her evidence on the contested issue of whether the Applicant had requested her to ring the deceased was not a sound basis upon which to make a finding that the Applicant had planned the confrontation. 
20Certainly his Honour does not make clear whether his absence of doubt was induced in part by the earlier matters to which he had referred but when regard is had to the totality of evidence available to his Honour, I am not persuaded that he was not entitled to come to the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant sought the attendance of the deceased and in due course was aware that the he was coming, i.e. that the Applicant planned a confrontation.  In this connection it is not irrelevant that the evidence of Mr Banks was quite inconsistent with that of the Applicant that he had remained upstairs during the afternoon and tended to show that the Applicant was downstairs about 5 minutes after his wife's last call to the deceased  21It was also submitted that the issue of whether the confrontation was planned was a central issue between the parties and the Applicant's trial for murder and the jury had acquitted the Applicant of that charge.  However while the acquittal argues strongly against there being any planned murder or use of a knife, it is not necessarily inconsistent with the planning of a lesser confrontation such as his Honour found.
Ground 2
22In the third paragraph of his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour said:-
It remains for me to pass sentence.  Before I do so, I must determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion, in a manner consistent with the jury verdict.  Where the facts are adverse, they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Where they favour Mr Goundar, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities. 
23Although when making his finding that the Applicant planned the confrontation with the deceased his Honour did not again expressly advert to the standard required, it cannot reasonably be supposed that he did not remain conscious of it.  This ground fails.
Ground 3
His Honour erred in-
(a) failing to make a finding about the degree of provocation caused by the conduct of the victim towards or affecting the Applicant; or
(b) failing to find that the degree of provocation was high.
24Under the rubric of this ground, counsel for the Applicant submitted that Kirby J failed to properly take into account the gravity of the provocation. 
25His Honour's remarks, when directing attention specifically to the topic of provocation, are set out in paragraphs [59]-[61] which I have quoted.  The only other matters which it was suggested his Honour should have taken into account were statements by the Applicant during the course of events in the bedroom, ""you betrayed me, I was your friend, I was your brother"", statements of the Applicant reported in a Pre-Sentence Report to the effect that ""he felt like a laughing stock amongst the Fijian Indian community as he felt that a lot of people knew about (his wife's) affair, but didn't tell him"" and evidence of the Applicant's brother that, at the time he took the Applicant to hospital on 28 January, the Applicant was ""distressed, withdrawn, shattered, broken down, he was like a living dead"".  Counsel also referred to a further passage from Allen J's judgment in Khan (1996) 86 A Crim R 552 at 557-8, viz:-
For many men adultery committed with his wife is an intolerable insult to his manhood and an act of gross betrayal. Violent reaction to adultery is no new phenomenon. It has existed as long as men have been men and doubtless it will continue for as long as men are men. 
26His Honour referred to the first of these matters at [35] of his remarks.  He quoted from the paragraph immediately before that which I have just quoted from Khan and although he did not expressly refer to the balance of the matters mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph, there are no grounds for concluding that his Honour was not conscious of them.  Thus the questions that remain are whether in the respects stated in this ground of appeal and the first paragraph in this part of these reasons his Honour erred.
27In my view he did not.  In the first place, it is clear from what his Honour did say that he was conscious of the factors that argued for the provocation being regarded as of high order.  Secondly, there is no obligation on a judge in dealing with the topic to express in quantitative terms - high, medium-high, medium, low or the like - his assessment of the degree of provocation in a particular case.  Thirdly, in the circumstances here, whether his Honour properly took into account the gravity of the provocation is best left until grounds 4 and 5 are considered.
Grounds 4 and 5
4. His Honour erred in finding that the offence was well above the midrange.
5. The sentence was manifestly excessive.
28These grounds were argued together and it is appropriate to deal with them similarly here.
29I have no doubt that the provocation, particularly when one takes into account the fact that, as his Honour accepted, his wife walked into their bedroom with the deceased's arms around her, might fairly be described as significant.  However, as his Honour also pointed out, the Applicant had had some two weeks to accept that his wife and the deceased were having an affair and the Applicant planned, or at least was privy to the planning of, the confrontation - a confrontation that was certainly not unlikely to result in some violence.  
30And there are some other matters to take into account.  Firstly, on the Applicant's own evidence his marriage, if not completely over, started ""getting bad"" in the beginning of 2006 and was ""a disaster"".  Although he was still in love with his wife, he wanted to divorce her as quickly as possible.  He had been drunk every day ""since she kicked (him) out of the house"" which might be inferred to have been the date of the AVO and which preceded 26 January.  Furthermore, once one accepts his Honour's conclusion that the Applicant was involved in the deceased coming to the house and his own evidence that he remained in the bedroom (at least while the deceased was at the house), that the provocation occurred there is something for which he is not without responsibility.   
31Relevant also are his Honour's findings contained in [64] which I have quoted and in the following:-
65  The Crown, in its submissions, said this: 
'20. ... There is evidence that the defendant ... moved him into the bath and he was heard to be moaning, obviously in pain for some time. No attempt was made to assist him, or obtain assistance for him and he ultimately died. The defendant allowed him to suffer until he ultimately passed away.'
66  I accept that submission.
32His Honour accepted that the confrontation planned by the Applicant did not include the use of a knife (and if it had, it is difficult to see how the Applicant would not have been guilty of murder).  However, when all of the facts are taken into account, I find no error in his Honour's characterisation of the offence.
33Turning to the fifth ground of appeal, it may be accepted that, as revealed by the Judicial Commission statistics covering the period April 2004 to March 2011 (the latest available), the sentence imposed on the Applicant was relatively high.  The full term and non-parole period of the sentence imposed on the Applicant fall respectively within the top 9% and top 3% of sentences and non-parole periods imposed on persons who pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  Furthermore, his Honour accepted that the Applicant had been in regular employment, had no criminal convictions (though was facing charges of, on 12 January, assaulting his wife and knowingly breach an apprehended violence order and, having been given bail, failing to appear) and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  On the other hand, his Honour regarded the Applicant as having little remorse in relation to the victim.
34In the course of submissions, both counsel referred the Court to a number of previous cases in aid of arguments that the sentence was or was not manifestly excessive.  Having regard to the fact that the sentence is high by comparison with others reflected in the statistics, I have included as an appendix to these reasons a summary of most of the cases to which the Court was referred and also reference to a few others.  A number of features stand out.
35Firstly, it is apparent that sentences have tended to increase over the last decade or so.  This is no doubt a reflection of the view that sentences in this area were too lenient.  Secondly, Kirby J's starting point of 13 years is higher than that in any of the cases referred to.  In R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99, it was 12 years.  In R v Marlow [2003] NSWSC 1130, R v Hammoui (No 4) [2005] NSWSC 279 and R v Stevens [2008] NSWSC 1370, it was 11 years.  In R v Lovett [2009] NSWSC 1427, it was 10 years and 8 months.  In the other cases it was less.  Thirdly, undoubtedly within these cases there are features - less provocation or greater criminality in response - that argue for the starting point in the determination of the Applicant's sentence being lighter than in one or more of those cases.
36Since writing the above, I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of RA Hulme J.  I agree with them.
37However, the differences between those cases and this preclude any exact comparison and in any event, sentencing involves a degree of discretion and there is not in any particular case, only one right sentence.  The sentence imposed on the Applicant was undoubtedly a heavy one but I remain unpersuaded that it was so high as to be manifestly excessive.  In that connection it must also be remembered that the primary comparison that must be made is not with statistics or previous cases but the statutory provision.   The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years and Kirby J's starting point was only marginally above half of that figure.
38Given the issues raised, I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.
39RA HULME J:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of RS Hulme J.  I agree with what has been said, and the conclusions that have been reached, in relation to grounds 1 to 3.  I also agree that grounds 4 and 5 should not be upheld but wish to provide my own reasons. 
40I agree with the observation by RS Hulme J that the sentence was ""undoubtedly a heavy one"".   The fact that the starting point of 13 years was higher than in any of the cases to which we were referred strongly supports that observation, as do the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics.
41It is important to observe that intervention by this Court on a ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive is not warranted simply because the sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases:  Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 538 [59]. 
42The cases to which the Court was referred were confined to those in which murder was reduced to manslaughter by virtue of provocation.  That is understandable as undoubtedly counsel were seeking to identify the most comparable cases.  Sight should not be lost, however, of the fact that manslaughter in all of its various forms, is subject to the maximum penalty of imprisonment of 25 years.  Further, this Court has said on a number of occasions that it is not the variety or legal basis of manslaughter but the facts which determine the objective gravity of a particular case:  see, for example, R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381; R v Dally [2000] NSWCCA 162; (2000) 115 A Crim R 582 per Smart AJ at [64]; and R v Hoerler (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 per Spigelman CJ at [29].
43The sentencing statistics to which we were referred show that there are relatively few cases in which higher sentences have been imposed.  The limitations of such statistics have been the subject of frequent comment in judgments of this Court (for example, R v Lao at [2003] NSWCCA 315 per Spigelman CJ at [32]; R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169; (2010) 209 A Crim R 218 per Kirby J at [70]; and Windle v R [2011] NSWCCA 277 per Hoeben J at [62] - [65]) and of the High Court of Australia (Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen, supra, at [48]).
44In R v BW [2011] NSWCCA 176, Whealy JA had the following to say about the relevance of statistics and decisions in other cases in the context of a manslaughter sentence:
[61] ... In relation to the graphs and statistics argument, it is necessary to bear in mind that, in the case of manslaughter especially, neither a consideration of statistical information, nor, for that matter, an examination of the results in other decided cases, illuminates in any decisive manner the decision to be reached in a particular case. Sentences for manslaughter vary greatly, because of variations in the circumstances of the individual instances of the offence: Taber v R; Styman v R (2007) 170 A Crim R 427 at [102]; R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 [133] - [134]; R v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97 at [24]; see also R v Vongsouvanh [2004] NSWCCA 158 at [38] where reliance on data was described as ""unhelpful and even dangerous""; R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144; R v McGuire (Unreported, NSWCCA, 30 August 1995); R v Troja (Unreported, NSWCCA, 16 July 1991).
45There are other cases in which remarks have been made about the limited utility of comparing sentences imposed in other cases.  The correct position was comprehensively described by Grove J in Stephens v R [2009] NSWCCA 240:
[28] In support of argument on this ground counsel provided the Court with a table of sentencing outcomes together with copies of various judgments and remarks on sentence pertaining thereto. In R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505, where an extensive examination of manslaughter sentences was undertaken Barr J commented that ""so variable is the crime of manslaughter both in its legal formulation and range of culpability which it contemplates, that the identification of the available range of sentence in any case is notoriously difficult."" That difficulty does not disappear by seeking to collect cases where liability is incurred in a particular fashion. In Ward v R (2006) 166 A Crim R 273 the Court (Tobias JA, Howie and Rothman JJ) stated the position to be (at pars 70-74):
""....the position is this. First, the offence of manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence and consequently, the identification of an available range of sentences in any individual case is notoriously difficult, if not impossible. It is thus rare for there to be any real comparison between facts.
Second, matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter with the consequence that it is impossible to establish a pattern or tariff. This applies not only to manslaughter generally, but also to cases of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence.
Third, in order for an appellate court to intervene with respect to a sentence imposed upon the ground that it is manifestly excessive, it is necessary for an appellant to establish that the sentencing judge's discretion has miscarried in the House v The King sense and, relevantly to a case such as the present, that the sentence imposed was so disproportionate to the circumstances in which the offence occurred as to afford the foundation for concluding that the sentencing judge's exercise of his sentencing discretion had miscarried.
Fourth, such disproportion must result in the sentence imposed being unreasonable or plainly unjust.
Fifth, such a result cannot follow merely because a member of the appellate court may have exercised their discretion, had they been the first instance judge in a manner different from that of the sentencing judge.""
[29] Similar consideration was articulated by Spigelman CJ in R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 (pars 133-134):
""As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Blacklidge (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60510 of 1995, 12 December 1995), esp at 2-3). In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder (R v Weinman (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252; R v Hoerler (2004) 147 A Crim R at [39]).
It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation within any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter.""
[30] Examination of individual cases should not cause sight to be lost of the guidepost provided by Parliament in prescribing an available maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty five years. It is not suggested that the present case approached a worst case category nor that the applicant is in the worst category of offenders so as to consider imposition of that maximum but it is a guide to any assessment and, where manifest excess is asserted comparison of the actual sentence and the parliamentary prescription can assist in revealing whether or not error is demonstrated.
[31] The Crown Prosecutor drew attention to the recent decision in Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 5 where the circumstances might be considered to portray a culpability of the offender with some parallels to those of the applicant. Again, a comparative exercise does not necessarily provoke a conclusion and the error of such an approach was remarked upon by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371:
""It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar offences. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range.""
[32] The applicant points to no specific error by the learned sentencing judge. As was observed in the joint judgment, (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Markarian v The Queen (2006) 228 CLR 357 (at par 27) it should be remembered:
""As has been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.""
46The real question posed by Ground 5 is not whether the sentence is out of keeping with sentences imposed in the other cases to which the Court was referred, or with those in the Judicial Commission's statistical database.  It is whether the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust:  Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].  
47I am not persuaded that there is any merit in Grounds 4 or 5.  I am satisfied that it was open to Kirby J to find that the offence was ""well above midrange"" and that this was ""a serious case of manslaughter by provocation"".  Matters which underpinned those findings included that there was ""a ferocious and sustained attack""; an intention to kill; and that the applicant allowed the deceased to suffer until he ultimately passed away.  Aggravating features concerning the objective seriousness of the offence were that the offence was committed in company; a knife was used; and that the deceased's body was dumped in bushland.  There was the further aggravating feature that the applicant was on bail.
48Notwithstanding the undoubted severity of the sentence, I am not of the view that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  
49I agree with the orders proposed by R S Hulme J.APPENDIX
All of the cases referred to are ones where the sentence imposed was for manslaughter, provocation being the rationale for the offence not being murder.  Some of the offenders were charged with murder and acquitted of that charge.  Some had pleaded guilty to manslaughter when arraigned.
In R v See [2001] NSWSC 776, I imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years including a non-parole period of 4½ years.  A deal of the provocation was puerile teasing, although, on at least two occasions, the deceased talked about killing the offender.  One of those occasions was shortly before the offence and introduced a degree of fear in the prisoner.  Teasing continued, the deceased remarked he wanted to hit the prisoner and invited the latter ""if you dare, you come over to chop me"".  The offender who was using a pointed carving knife in a kitchen at the time charged at the deceased, stabbed him a number of times, and then grabbed a meat cleaver with which he also struck the deceased who suffered 30 stab or incised wounds.  I regarded the degree of provocation as no more than moderate and the degree of violence as extreme.
At the time, the offender was under a degree of strain trying to avoid immigration officials because he and the deceased were in Australia on tourist visas but were working.  The offender had no criminal record and seemed to have worked hard to assist his parents.  He had also suffered bullying and teasing at school, sometimes returning home in tears.  He was remorseful.  No discount on account of a plea was allowed.
In arriving at the sentence in that case, I considered a number of prior decisions and included a summary of them as a schedule to my reasons.  The full terms of the sentences so referred to varied between 6 and 8 years and averaged about 6.75 years. I noted that in one of the cases I referred to, R v Alexander (1995) 78 A Crim R 141, Hunt CJ at CL had appended a similar schedule and the median full term of the sentences included in that schedule was 6 years.  It should however also be noted that in 2 of the cases referred to by Hunt CJ where the offender had pleaded guilty, total sentences of 8 years and 8½ years had been imposed.
In R v Marlow [2003] NSW SC 1130, Studdert J sentenced an offender to imprisonment for 9 years, including a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months.  In arriving at this sentence his Honour allowed a discount ""approaching 20%"", using as a starting point 11 years. 
Studdert J found that the offender had indulged in a ""most violent and sustained attack"" and had an intent to kill.  There were nine potentially fatal knife wounds and nine other wounds.  The provocation was found to be a sexual assault 11 years earlier when the offender was 16 and a further sexual assault on the night of the killing.  His Honour found that the degree of provocation was of real significance notwithstanding that it tended to be lower because, before visiting the deceased's home, the offender had contemplated that some form of sexual advance might occur.
The offender had an unimpressive employment history, had developed an alcohol abuse disorder in early adult life, was regarded as having had a depressed mood at the time of the offence, and had no prior convictions.  His prospects of rehabilitation were considered to be reasonable. 
In R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99 this Court allowed an appeal and reduced the offender's sentence to one of 12 years including a non-parole period of 9 years.  He had hit the deceased with a weight bar and then repeatedly in the head with the weight bar or a dumb bell.  He later demonstrated a callousness in dealing with the victim's body that was regarded as inconsistent with any remorse.
The provocation that led to the conviction being for manslaughter lay in part in the deceased's conduct during a relationship of some standing, including her use of a knife on more than one occasion and her cutting the offender's young son.  Shortly prior to the killing there had been another disagreement during which the victim had inflicted an injury on the offender causing him to bleed.  However the report and that of the proceedings at first instance - [2004] NSWSC 189 - indicate disbelief of at least parts of the offender's account, do not make clear the extent of the provocation at that stage.  The offender was found to have had an intent to kill and his criminality was regarded as ""very high"".  The reports do not indicate that there was any discount for a plea.
The offender was 35 at the time of his offence.  He had a lengthy criminal history, and was found to have a propensity for violence when crossed or thwarted.  His prospects of rehabilitation were regarded as bleak. 
In R v Bullock [2005] NSW 1071 Buddin J imposed a sentence of 8 years including a non-parole period of 5 years on an offender who pleaded guilty.  Although he did not quantity it, Buddin J indicated that he would allow the offender a discount appropriate to his plea.  It may be inferred the allowance was in the range of 10 to 15%.
The offender had had a substantial amount to drink.  He was in a hotel where, without justification, the deceased accused him of hitting the deceased and punched the offender several times in the face, breaking his nose and inflicting other injuries.  The victim then left the hotel with friends.  Outside the offender said to him, ""You're going to die tonight"", went to his father's house nearby, procured 2 knives and returned to the group at the hotel.  He asked the victim, ""Why did you hit me?"" to which the victim responded with another attempt to punch the offender.  The latter then stabbed the victim inflicting 6 stab wounds and 4 superficial cuts.  Buddin J was not prepared to find that the offender had an intention to kill.
The offender was 25 at the time of the offence.  He had had a troubled upbringing, had been in steady employment for the previous 5 or 6 years and was regarded as a dedicated and industrious worker.  He had good prospects of rehabilitation provided he addressed drug and alcohol usage, anger management and possibly unresolved issues from his childhood.
In R v Hammoui (No 4) [2005] NSWSC 279, Kirby J imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 11 years including a non-parole period of 8 years.  The report does not suggest there was any discount for a plea.  It appeared that after the offender and the deceased met pursuant to some arrangement, the offender bound her wrists with sticky tape and then strangled her.  His Honour found that the offender had an intention to kill and had been guilty of gratuitous cruelty, although the report does not suggest this extended beyond the binding of the wrists and strangulation.  At the time of the offence, the applicant was on bail for possession of a firearm.  He had a history which included serious criminal offences, many involving violence.  A psychologist assessed him as evidencing a markedly paranoid disposition and Kirby J was unable to say that his prospects of rehabilitation were good.  His Honour found there was no contrition.  The offender was 27 at the time of offending.
During a number of periods in the four years or so prior to her death, the offender and the deceased had been in an intimate relationship, though from time to time the deceased seems to have formed similar relationships with other people and, for a time, worked as a prostitute.  In the period immediately prior to her death, the deceased was in an intimate relationship with both the offender and another male.  The offender was clearly jealous but his Honour said that it was not possible to say which particular aspect of the provocation suggested it was that the Crown had not eliminated beyond reasonable doubt.
In R v Frost [2008] NSWSC 220, Barr J imposed a sentence of 6 years including a non-parole period of 3½ years on an offender who pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  Although he did not quantify it, his Honour said that the offender was entitled to a substantial discount for his plea.  He had killed his wife by an unlawful and dangerous act in ""a sudden and unexpected burst of anger, precipitated by the deceased's abhorrent proposal ..."".  He had not intended to kill her.  The offender was of good character and judged unlikely to re-offend.  The report does not record the offender's age.
In R v Mitchell [2008] NSWSC 320, Howie J imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 8 years and 3 months, including a non-parole period of 4½ years.  His Honour's commencing point was 10 years from which he allowed a discount of 17½% for the offender's plea.  A sentence for another offence imposed at the same time can be ignored.  
The basis for the charge of manslaughter rather than murder was provocation.  It seems to have been accepted that the offender woke from sleep to find the deceased fellating him, provocation that Howie J regarded as not of an extremely gross nature.  The offender then attacked the deceased with a hammer, something Howie J described as very greatly out of proportion to the provocation.  His Honour also accepted the opinion of a psychiatrist that the offender, who had a history of mental health problems and serious alcohol abuse since age 13, had personality traits that would have made it more difficult to cope with the provocative conduct.  His Honour said that the nature of the offender's response was largely due to his personality problems and to him being under the influence of alcohol.  Prior to sentence the offender had been on protection because of difficulties interacting with the general prison population and his Honour backdated the sentence on that account.  The offender who was aged about 22 at the time of the offence had a significant criminal record.  Howie J had reservations about the offender's prospects of rehabilitation in view of the fact that a number of assisted attempts in the past had been unsuccessful.
In R v Stevens [2008] NSWSC 1370 Hall J sentenced the offender to imprisonment for 8 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 6 years and 7 months after allowing a discount of 20% for a plea.  These figures indicate that his Honour's starting point must have been 11 years.
The offender and deceased were in a domestic relationship at the time of the offence.  Both were addicted to drugs.  Hall J accepted a submission from the Crown that the degree of violence and the gravity of the offence were extreme and the provocation was low.  The violence seemed to have been blunt trauma such as punching or kicking and which resulted in intra-abdominal bleeding from an injured spleen and in acute subdural bleeding.  Blood stains were found on floors, furniture and other items in 4 separate areas of a house.  The provocation seems to have been mainly the deceased's disabled and dysfunctional condition including failure to look after a new baby and, to a lesser extent, some infidelity which was the subject of discussion on the evening of her death.  
The offender, aged about 40 at the time of offending, had a history of offences of assault and breaching apprehended violence orders though none in the 4 years prior to the subject offence.  After his arrest he was diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder with depressed mood or a clinically significant level of depression.  Hall J found that the offender had some degree of remorse but that there was little evidence as to his prospects of rehabilitation.
In Berrier v R [2009] NSWCCA 40 this Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 6 years.  There seems to have been no plea discount.  At first instance - [2006] NSWSC 1421 - Hidden J said that there was a significant measure of provocation.  It was found to exist in a background of animosity, a fight earlier in the afternoon and aggression displayed by the victim chasing the offender with a piece of wood and attempting to secure another immediately before being stabbed.  There was but one stab wound although there may have been another one attempted.   It was also found that the offender may have been disinhibited to some extent by alcohol and his intention was to cause merely grievous bodily harm.
The offender was 22 at the time of the offence, he had no significant criminal record and a very low level of intellectual functioning and Hidden J at first instance remarked that the ""personality profile and those intellectual deficits may provide some explanation for the crime.  His Honour said that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. 
In R v Lovett [2009] NSWSC 1427 Barr J imposed a sentence of 10 years and 8 months, including a non-parole period of 8 years.  The offender had come to suspect that the deceased was having an affair with the offender's previous partner from whom he was separated.  Taking a knife from the place where he was living the offender went to his partner's residence and came upon the deceased and his partner in the act of sexual intercourse.  He stuck a single, and fatal, blow to the deceased's chest.  He then attacked the deceased with a garden stake, kicked him in the genitals, dragged him out to the front lawn and then kicked him in the jaw, fracturing it in 2 places.  Barr J said that at most the events of the day earlier than the sexual intercourse and which aroused the offender's suspicions, if provocative at all, were only mildly so.  Barr J said that he was not satisfied that the offender had an intent to kill but observed nevertheless that the facts called for a strongly deterrent sentence.
The offender was 21 at the time of the offence.  He had been in trouble with the law for the preceding 7 years committing a number of offences of violence. He was addicted to drugs.  His Honour doubted if the offender was remorseful and said that he did not think that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation were good.  The report contains no mention of a plea discount. 
In R v Gabriel [2010] NSWSC 13, Price J imposed a sentence of 9 years and 3 months including a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months.  A plea of guilty to manslaughter had not been accepted by the Crown but resulted in Price J giving a discount of 10% on account of it.  His Honour's starting point was 10 years and 4 months.
The offender's actions involved striking his wife on the head 7 times with a large hammer and with a very large amount of force, a degree of violence his Honour characterised as extreme and administered with an intent to kill.  There had been a variety of problems in the offender's marriage although his Honour found that the degree of provocation offered to the offender over the years was not of a high order.  There was a final straw when, in the course of an argument, the deceased held a knife at the offender's throat.  His Honour also found that there was some impairment in the offender's capacity to understand events and to control himself arising from an abnormality of mind due to dementia and depression, but the impairment was not substantial.
At the time of offending the offender was 62.  He had no prior convictions.  Price J was satisfied that he was remorseful and was unlikely to re-offend.  Special circumstances were found in part because of the potential for the offender's mental state to deteriorate in prison.

		09 May 2012",2012-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708247,R v Patricia Anne GALLAGHER [2012] NSWSC 484,"ex tempore Judgment
1The Court has conducted an inquiry under s 10 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") into whether Patricia Anne Gallagher is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder.  This judgment records my reasons for concluding that she is unfit to be tried.
Background
2On 15 November 2010 Ms Gallagher was arrested.  She was later charged that between 10pm on 11 February 2009 and 12.43am on 12 February 2009 at Revesby in the State of New South Wales she did murder William Grant.
3The Crown case statement records that it is the Crown's allegation that Ms Gallagher stabbed the victim, Mr Grant, some time between 11.25pm on 11 February 2009 and 12.27am on 12 February 2009 once with a single bladed knife while he was sleeping.
4Ms Gallagher has been remanded in custody since the time of her arrest. She was committed to trial on 16 December 2011.  She was due to be arraigned on 2 March 2011.  Due to the unavailability of certain reports the arraignment date was adjourned to 5 April 2012.  However she was not arraigned as an issue as to her fitness to be tried was raised.
5Pursuant to s 8 of the Act, Latham J directed that an inquiry should be conducted as to the question of whether she was unfit to be tried for the offence of murder.
Legislative Provisions and Relevant Principles of Law
6I have already referred to ss 8 and 10 of the Act.  Section 11 of the Act provides that the question of the person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by a judge alone.  Subsection 12(1) enables representation of an accused person by an Australian legal practitioner at such an inquiry.  Subsection 12(2) provides that the proceedings are not to be conducted in an adversarial manner; that has been certainly complied with in this case.  Subsection 12(3) provides that there is no onus of proof resting upon any party at an inquiry into whether someone is fit to be tried.
7Consistent with these provisions Ms Gallagher has been represented by Mr Austin of Senior Counsel.
8The Crown tendered by consent a number of psychiatric and psychological reports concerning Ms Gallagher, and both the Crown and Mr Austin SC provided submissions of great assistance to the Court.
9By the operation of s 14 of the Act if, following an inquiry, a person is found to be unfit to be tried then the proceedings instituted against them must not be recommenced.  The Court must refer the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  The Court also may make various orders as provided for in s 14(b) of the Act.
10If the matter is referred to the Tribunal then that Tribunal must determine whether the accused person will, during the period of twelve months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the offence.  Various steps in the legislative regime are engaged depending on the outcome of that inquiry.
11In Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 246 Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ confirmed that an assessment of whether a person is unfit to be tried is to be determined by reference to the factors identified by Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45; [1958] ALR 248 and ""by reference to the length of the trial"".  The criteria in Presser require that Ms Gallagher must be able to:
(a)Understand with what she has been charged.(b)Enter a plea to the charge.(c)Exercise her right to challenge any juror.(d)Understand generally the nature of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether she did what she is charged with.(e)Follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is happening without the necessity to understand all the various aspect of court formality.(f)Understand the substantial effect of any evidence which may be given against her in support of the prosecution, and;(g)Give her counsel instructions, including her version of the facts which are sufficient to make her defence and answer the charge. 
The Crown Case Statement
12Tendered before me by consent on this inquiry was the Crown case statement, to which I have already referred.  I am treating the statement as a description of the matters the Crown anticipates it can prove at any trial if one were to occur.  It follows from my description of the purpose of this inquiry that it is no part of my function at this point to evaluate the strength or weaknesses of the Crown case.  It is however, necessary to refer to aspects of the Crown case in order to describe the likely length and complexity of any trial that might otherwise occur.
13The Crown case statement is 94 paragraphs in length.  The first paragraph recites:
""The Crown case is based on both direct and circumstantial evidence which suggests that no other person could have been responsible for the murder of William Grant other than the accused Patricia Anne Gallagher.""
Consistent with that description of the Crown case the bulk of the statement provides a very detailed breakdown of the events from around 11.45am on 11 February 2009 until Mr Grant was pronounced dead at Liverpool Hospital at 4.15am on 12 February 2009.
14The Crown case statement reveals that the Crown will seek to prove, by reference to telephone calls, police witnesses and a number of other witnesses who had contact with Ms Gallagher and the deceased on that day, that she was the only person who could have inflicted the fatal stab wound on Mr Grant.  Presumably the Crown would also seek to exclude any reasonable possibility that the wounds were self-inflicted.
15The Crown brief consists of three volumes of statements and exhibits, transcripts of interviews, calls to the triple-0 number and transcripts of listening devices.  The authors of the statement include a number of police officers, including forensic witnesses and ambulance officers, doctors and, as stated, various associates of Ms Gallagher and the deceased.
16The Crown case statement also reveals that the Crown will seek to introduce and rely upon certain statements that it is alleged Ms Gallagher made to undercover operatives, including statements made on the day of her arrest which are described as ""Full Admissions/Confession"".
17This brief description of the Crown case and, from what I can discern is the evidence said to support it, is sufficient for me to conclude that any trial of the charge against Ms Gallagher is likely to be lengthy and complex.  Both counsel agreed that it was a matter that was likely to occupy a number of weeks, if not months of hearing time.
Expert Evidence
18Ms Gallagher was examined by a psychiatrist retained by the Legal Aid Commission on her behalf, Dr Olav Nielssen, on 12 August 2011.  He provided a report dated 30 September 2011. Ms Gallagher was also examined by a neuropsychologist retained by the Legal Aid Commission, Dr Susan Pullman, on 26 September 2011 and 6 October 2011.  Dr Pullman prepared a report dated 11 October 2011.
19Ms Gallagher was examined by a psychiatrist retained on behalf of the Crown, Dr Stephen Allnutt, on 20 February 2011.  Dr Allnutt prepared two reports; one dated March 2012 and the other dated 13 April 2012. She was also examined by a clinical psychologist retained by the Crown, Dr McMahon.  On 24 and 30 March 2012.  Dr John McMahon prepared a report on 30 March 2012. 
20These reports were all tendered before me.  Doctors Nielssen, Allnutt and McMahon were all ultimately of the view that Ms Gallagher is unfit to be tried.  Dr Pullman did not expressly address that question but, as I will explain, her findings are completely consistent with that conclusion.
21To the extent that these reports contain a recitation of Ms Gallagher's personal circumstances and medical history I received those reports as evidence of the matters asserted.
22All of the medical reports record aspects of Ms Gallagher's personal medical history.  It is apparent that verifying that history was difficult.  With that note of caution I record that history as follows.
23Ms Gallagher was 50 years of age at the time it is alleged she committed the offence. She is now 53.  Both her parents were married several times and she has one older sister and four half brothers.  She advised Dr Pullman she was raised by her sister.  She reported that her father was an alcoholic.  She had persistent difficulties at school.  She has a brief work history involving manual jobs.  Ms Gallagher advised Dr Pullman that:
""Throughout her late teens and her early adult life she reported several physically and emotionally abusive defacto relationships; including a marriage...which lasted approximately five years.  She had one daughter however she reported that her daughter...had been removed by the Department of Childrens Services...because of her ""abusive husband"" and domestic violence in the home.""
24Two aspects of her medical history should be noted.  First, it is clear that Ms Gallagher has as long history of alcohol abuse.  Dr Pullman reported her as stating that she says she was drinking daily at age 12.  All of the material points to a continuous habit of excessive alcohol consumption since that time.
25Second, although the precise details differ in a number of respects, all of the reports record a history of Ms Gallagher having received various head injuries and suffering seizures.  The reports include references to her having been in a number of motor vehicle accidents in her early 20s and to her later being the victim of bashings.  All of the psychiatrists and psychologists accept the likely existence of a brain injury from trauma.  Some of them speculate about damage to her frontal lobes.
26I will address each of the reports.
27Dr Nielssen diagnosed Ms Gallagher as having alcohol dependence and abuse disorder, brain injury, which was said to be both traumatic and alcohol related, and epilepsy.  He expressed the opinion that:
""Ms Gallagher demonstrated that she understood the charge, had some knowledge of the evidence in the case against her and had a general understanding of the nature of the proceedings. However, I believe she is unfit for trial because she has a communication disorder that affects her ability to provide reliable instructions or give evidence on her own account. Based on the lack of any change in her presentation between the ERISP interview and the recent interview I believe her condition is permanent and is unlikely to improve within twelve months.""
28Dr Nielssen also expressed the opinion that Ms Gallagher may be able to raise a defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind to the offence with which she is charged.  I express no opinion on that matter.
29Dr Pullman undertook an assessment of Ms Gallagher's intellectual and cognitive functioning.  She concluded:
""Her overall level of intellectual function fell within the Extremely Low range with her individual result falling below the 1st percentile (0.5).  This means that in terms of her Full Scale IQ, Ms Gallagher was functioning at a level equal to or better than only 0.5 per cent of the normal population on this test.  Her GAI score also fell within the Extremely Low range and at the 1st percentile.  However there was a significant and unusually large difference between her verbal and non-verbal abilities, with such a large difference occurring in only 9.5 per cent of the population.  Therefore her Full Scale IQ and GAI should not be interpreted.  Her verbal and non-verbal abilities should be interpreted separately. 
Her non-verbal abilities such as non-verbal abstract reasoning, problem solving and visuoconstructional abilities fell within the Borderline range and at the 5th percentile.  In contrast, her verbal abilities, including vocabulary, social comprehension skills, general knowledge and verbal abstract reasoning, all consistently fell within the Extremely Low range and at the 0.3 percentile.""
30I would interpolate that criterion (g) that I have extracted from Presser emphasises the need for the person accused to be able to communicate with their legal representatives in order to convey their version of the events the subject of the charge.  Bearing in mind that particular criterion, it is important to note Dr Pullman's conclusion that:
""Her verbal skills are significantly weaker, falling in the Extremely Low range.  This is not unexpected given her poor educational and vocational background; however this discrepancy is considered unusual, possibly supporting her reports of learning difficulties and hearing problems.  She also has severely impaired attentional abilities, significant executive dysfunction, including mental flexibility, conceptional and abstract reasoning, planning and organisation, disinhibition and perseveration.  Her new learning and memory is also Extremely Low.  Her processing speed, basic language, visuospatial and visuoconstructional skills remain relatively intact.  Finally, she endorses significantly elevated levels of depression, stress and anxiety at present.""
31In his report of 1 March 2012 Dr Allnutt considered that the presentation and history of Ms Gallagher were:
""...suggestive of an underlying cognitive disorder, however the nature and severity of this disorder can only be confirmed through formal neuropsychological assessment.""
32Dr Allnutt concluded that Ms Gallagher had the capacity to understand the charges against her, the general nature of the proceedings and that she could, with the assistance of counsel, exercise her right to challenge.  However Dr Allnutt stated:
""My concern relates to her capacity to give instructions predominately more as a consequence of her probable memory problems than her inability to communicate; while she has some communication difficulty I do not believe this impairs her capacity to provide her version of the facts or let the Court know what it is (although in cross-examination she might be a more vulnerable person than most) but in interview with me she seemed to have some difficulty in understanding various court processes and seemed to be quite easily confused, suggesting she has learning difficulties; this became more apparent near the end of the interview when she seemed to have difficulty in understanding the consequences of a finding of guilty or not guilty, requiring some degree of clarification on my part; while she appeared to understand this I have concerns about probable underlying cognitive impairments that would impact on her capacity to follow proceedings and thus engage adequately and qualitatively with counsel during the course of the trial...
My provisional opinion is that she is likely unfit to stand trial.""
33This conclusion was expressed to be provisional because Dr Allnutt considered Ms Gallagher should undergo formal neuropsychological assessment.
34Dr Allnutt's second report of 13 April 2012 was prepared after such an assessment had been undertaken by Dr McMahon and made available to him.  In that report Dr Allnutt concluded, having regard to Dr McMahon's findings, that:
""... she has difficulty with regard to memory problems which impacts on her capacity to communicate adequately and that this would impair her ability to engage qualitatively with counsel during the course of the trial and to follow proceedings because she would be unable to maintain a recollection of events over time which would then impact on her ability to engage with the Court.  Based on his [Dr McMahon's] assessment and my clinical interview, I believe she is unfit to stand trial as a consequence of short term memory problems derived from Dementia.""
35Dr McMahon's report of 30 March 2012 sets out the results of an extensive neuropsychological assessment she had conducted on Ms Gallagher.  Dr McMahon concluded:
""Ms Gallagher's presentation, interpersonal style, speech and cognitive profile were consistent with her history of protracted heavy drinking, epileptiform disorder and history of head injury.  The findings were equivalent to those of Dr Pullman and Ms White as outlined in their report of 11 October 2011, revealing a consistent picture of impaired cognitive function.""
And then further:
""In my opinion given the cognitive difficulties as outlined above Ms Gallagher is unfit to stand trial due to significant limitations in her ability to engage in abstract verbal reasoning and remember complex verbal information across time suitably to inform her solicitor and instruct her defence.""
Conclusion
36It is no light matter to find a person unfit to be tried.  A common consequence of a such a finding is that the person can suffer indefinite incarceration without trial. However Ms Gallagher is guaranteed a fair trial according to law. One aspect of that guarantee is that a criminal trial cannot proceed unless the accused person is fit to plead (see Eastman v R [2000] HCA 29; (2003) CLR 1 at [64] per Gaudron J).
37One of the most important criteria identified in Presser is that the accused person be able to give their counsel instructions, including their version of the facts, sufficient to make their defence and answer the charge.  This criterion is to be considered in the light of the complexity and likely length of the trial.
38As I have stated, any trial that may occur will not be a straightforward matter and could occupy a significant amount of time.  Not surprisingly, both the Crown and Mr Austin SC have submitted that I should find Ms Gallagher is unfit to be tried.  This joint position reflects the unanimous opinion of the experts that I have already summarised.  In my view it is overwhelmingly clear that Ms Gallagher is clearly not capable of giving her counsel sufficient instructions, including her version of the facts, to enable her to make her defence to the charge of murder and answer the charge against her.  Accordingly I find that she is unfit to be tried.

2708248,Buckley v R; R v Buckley [2012] NSWCCA 85,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: In the early hours of the morning, before dawn on 25 July 2009 Sean Buckley (the applicant) was navigating a six metre aluminium fishing boat across Bate Bay, east of Cronulla. The boat capsized, throwing the applicant and two friends into the water. The applicant swam ashore and raised the alarm, but his friends drowned long before they were found by the searchers.

Background and Issues
2On 14 April 2011 the applicant was arraigned before a judge and jury on an indictment containing four counts. Each count alleged that he was navigating the vessel under the influence of intoxicating liquor when the vessel was involved in an ""impact"". Counts 1 and 2 related to the death of Mr Normann Baeger; counts 3 and 4 related to the death of Mr Baeger's partner, Ms Sulia Amoa-Fesolai. In respect of each deceased, the primary count (1 and 3) further alleged that the applicant had ""the prescribed concentration of alcohol"" present in his blood at the time of the accident. Counts 2 and 4 were in the alternative and made no allegation in respect of the prescribed concentration of alcohol. On 4 May 2011 a jury returned a verdict of guilty with respect to counts 1 and 3. 

3The hearing on sentence took place on 24 June 2011. By arrangement with the parties, the matter was stood over to 9 September for handing down sentence. The judge refused to continue the applicant's bail. In respect of each count, North DCJ sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment, with a further term of 18 months, giving a total sentence of two years six months. The sentences were accumulated to the extent of six months, the sentence on count 1 commencing on 24 June 2011 and expiring on 23 June 2012, with the non-parole period on count 3 commencing on 24 December 2011 and expiring on 23 December 2012. The minimum period of custody was thus 18 months.

4Promptly following sentence, the Director of Public Prosecutions gave notice of appeal against the sentences on the ground that they were manifestly inadequate. It was not until 3 April 2012 that counsel for the Director who appeared at the hearing of the appeal gave notice of three additional grounds, to which reference will be made below. Given the relatively short minimum custodial period, the delay requires comment. However, it was not caused, as the Court understood the explanation of counsel, by any dilatoriness on the part of the Director, but rather because the applicant indicated an intention to seek leave to appeal, formal notice of which was only given on 7 March 2012.

5The applicant identified two grounds on which he based his appeal against conviction, namely that the trial judge:

(1) failed to sum up the facts as they related to the ingredients of the offence in issue and as they related to the statutory defence, and 
(2) failed to include in his summing up a collected resume of the evidence as it related to the ingredients of the offence in issue and the statutory defence.

6Comment is required in respect of the nomenclature used for the parties. Although there was no application for leave to appeal, and the point was not debated, a person convicted on indictment has a right of appeal against conviction on any ground ""which involves a question of law alone"": s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Otherwise, leave is required. It is, at best, doubtful that these grounds of appeal could properly be characterised as involving questions of law alone; accordingly, it is convenient to treat the matter as one requiring leave. No objection was taken by counsel for the Director in respect of the failure to apply for leave and it is convenient to treat the matter as an application for leave to appeal heard concurrently with the appeal. Mr Buckley will be described as the applicant.

7The appeal against sentence is brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In the title to the proceedings, practice in this Court requires that he be referred to by the letter ""R"", being an abbreviation for the Queen, in Latin. The practice long predates the establishment of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions in 1987.

Appeal against conviction
8Before dealing with the specific criticisms made by the applicant of the summing up by the trial judge for the jury, it is desirable to identify the principles on which the applicant relies. 

9The starting point for the argument was the decision of this Court in R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 (Hunt, Enderby and Sharpe JJ). The issue of present relevance arose from the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that an attempt to receive a drug for supply is established only if the inference be drawn that the purpose of receiving the drug was to supply it to another: at 105B. The Court noted that the only matter ""really in issue"" was the element of purpose and continued at 105E:

""Nor was any of this factual issue ever put to the jury in such terms, as it should have been. A summing-up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resume of the evidence which relates to each of those ingredients and a brief outline of the arguments which have been put in relation to that evidence.... This is a rule which appears increasingly to be ignored by trial judges. It is not a compliance with that rule simply to read the relevant part of the section to the jury and then to read out the evidence which has been given chronologically, starting with the first witness and going through the evidence in chief, the cross-examination and then re-examination of each witness before turning to the next witness and so on. The idea of a summing-up is to present for the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine.""

10The statement in Zorad was reiterated by Hunt J, a year later, in R v Tillott (NSWCCA, 8 April 1991, unreported). Although, as the applicant accepted, aspects of these statements have since been qualified, both by legislation and by subsequent case law, the underlying principle is not in doubt. It involves two limbs: first, one composite obligation of the trial judge with respect to the jury is to identify the issues in dispute, identify the evidence relevant to each of the issues and identify any submissions as to how each of the issues should be resolved. Secondly, this function is not usually adequately performed by a chronological recitation of the evidence as presented, witness by witness.

11The first qualification to the statement in Zorad arose from the insertion of s 405AA into the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), a provision now found in s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). In its present form, s 161 reads:

""161 Summary by Judge

(1) At the end of a criminal trial before a jury, a Judge need not summarise the evidence given in the trial if of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, a summary is not necessary.

(2) This section applies despite any rule of law or practice to the contrary.

(3) Nothing in this section affects any aspect of a Judge's summing up function other than the summary of evidence in a trial.""

12The directions in Zorad have also been qualified and restated in more recent case law. In El-Jalkh v R [2009] NSWCCA 139 James J (Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreeing), after referring to Zorad and the statutory provision noted that it was well open to the trial judge in that case to form the view that a general summary of the evidence was not necessary: at [144]. After reference to earlier authority to similar effect, he summarised the principles at [147] in the following terms:

""It is clear from the authorities to which I have referred that it is an essential function of a trial judge in summing-up to a jury that the trial judge, having identified the issue or issues in the trial, put the defence case on that issue or those issues and that the trial judge make such references to the evidence as may be required to enable the jury properly to understand the defence case and that it is not sufficient for the trial judge to say to the jury that they should give consideration to the arguments which have been put by counsel.""

13Finally, reference was made to the more recent decision of this Court in RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235, in which Bathurst CJ (with the concurrence and James and Johnson JJ) noted that the principal qualification to the statements in Zorad was that the obligation to identify issues and relate the evidence and argument to those issues was limited to those matters which were actually in dispute in the particular case: at [85].

14It is easy to state the basic requirements of a proper summing up: it is less easy to apply them in particular cases. Especially in times where every word uttered in the course of a trial is recorded and transcribed, there is considerable pressure on a trial judge to err on the side of excessive caution in referring to the evidence and the issues, lest any misstatement or omission be seized upon by counsel for the purposes of an appeal. The safest course, it may be thought, is to deal with the evidence as it has unfolded, in a largely chronological fashion. Unfortunately, that course is likely to be of less help to the jury than the more demanding course of identifying issues in dispute and relating relevant evidence to each issue in turn. It is clear that it is the latter course which must generally be adopted. Counsel for the applicant made much of the point that the trial judge had opted for the perhaps easier approach of a chronological recitation of the evidence.

15Even if the criticism were valid, it did not necessarily demonstrate a miscarriage of justice. Further, the preferred approach is not an inflexible rule. There will be cases where, for example, the issues are few, the evidence has been spread over a period of time and the witnesses called in a logical order, having regard to the real issues in dispute. In such a case the trial judge may consider that a chronological highlighting of important evidence, in the order it was received, is likely to assist the jury to an orderly consideration of the issues in dispute.

16For reasons which will be explained below, there was no miscarriage in the present case. It may also be noted that the formulation of the grounds of appeal, set out above, owed more to the original language used in Zorad than to the obligation as stated in later cases, with appropriate reference to the statutory qualification.

Basis of challenge to conviction
17The judge's direction to the jury was given in orderly and clear terms. After the usual general directions, the judge turned to what he identified as ""the essential elements or ingredients"" of each charge: Summing up, 2/05/11, p 12. He commenced with the more serious counts, 1 and 3. Three elements were not in dispute, namely that the accused had been navigating a vessel at the relevant time, that the boat had been involved ""in an impact"" (a term having an extended meaning) and that two people had died as a result of the impact. Three issues were in dispute, two involving elements of the offences and one a defence. The trial judge identified the elements of the offences in the following terms (p 13):

""Fourthly, that at the time of the impact the accused was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. This is in dispute. A person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor if his ability to manage or control a vessel is impaired. Now in relation to counts 1 and 3, there is also an additional element which the Crown must prove, again beyond reasonable doubt. That is that at the time of the impact the accused had the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood. This too is in dispute. The definition of prescribed concentration of alcohol for the purposes for count 1 and 3, which you are considering, is that the accused had 0.15 grams or more of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.""

18The trial judge next identified the defence which was in dispute, namely that, even if the elements of the charge were made out, it was open to the accused to demonstrate that ""it is more likely than not that the deaths resulting from the impact were not in any way attributable to alcohol"": p 14.

19There was, in substance, one critical issue, which had two limbs. The first concerned the level of inebriation of the accused. The evidence supported the conclusion that he and Mr Baeger had been drinking for several hours before commencing the fishing trip. Ms Amoa-Fesolai had not been drinking. When the three left Mr Baeger's home at about 2.30am to drive from Casula to Yowie Bay, she did the driving. The men took beer with them in the boat. The boat was launched at about 3am and the offender navigated to a point off Bundeena at the mouth of Port Hacking, where they stopped to fish briefly. They then rounded the southern headland of Bate Bay, which they intended to traverse in a northerly direction, motoring across the Bay to Merries Reef, near the northern headland.

20The boat capsized at some time between 3am and 4am. When the applicant reached the shore, he thought he had been in the water for up to an hour, but that was probably an exaggeration. He raised the alarm at a house behind Wanda Beach at about 4.05am. The first call to police was logged at 4.10am. 

21The applicant was taken to hospital shortly before 5am, and a blood sample taken at 6.40am. The reading of that sample was 0.146 grams per 100 mls. Dr Judith Perl, a clinical forensic pharmacologist estimated the accused's blood alcohol level at 3.30am as being between 0.178 grams per 100 mls and 0.225 grams per 100 mls. There was ample evidence to support the prosecution case that the blood alcohol level of the applicant at the time of the incident was well in excess of the prescribed concentration and at a level which would have involved a substantial impairment of his mental and physical functioning.

22There was a dispute as to how much beer the applicant had drunk in the course of the night. He claimed to have drunk approximately six bottles, whereas the pharmacologist expressed an opinion that the level of alcohol found in his blood could not have been achieved by drinking fewer than 13 bottles. The defence also raised the possibility that, having been in the water for a significant period, the applicant might have absorbed ethanol from the petrol leaking from the overturned boat. The issues were clearly identified for the jury. That they were satisfied by the prosecution evidence was unremarkable.

23The second major dispute in respect of the evidence was how the boat came to capsize. In various statements, the applicant had suggested there had been a freak wave, that the boat had hit a whale or had run into a sandbank or reef. There were no reefs in the area and no sandbanks extending more than 50 metres from the shore. Although one witness speculated that the boat capsized by coming too close to the shore, the prosecution case, supported by the evidence of the accused, was that the boat capsized farther out, probably between 500 metres and a kilometre offshore. The evidence did not allow the point of the incident to be identified with any degree of certainty, but there was nothing to support the suggestion that there was any sandbank or reef involved.

24The possibility that the boat hit a whale was speculative and unverifiable. Evidence was given as to the condition of the hull, including a gouge mark in the aluminium, although there was no agreement as to its likely cause. One of the officers noted the gouge mark , which caused him to have the vessel examined: Summing up, 2/05/11, p 36. The vessel was examined by Senior Constable Daley, however, he was unable to say how the damage had occurred or at what time: Tcpt, 27/04/11, p 348 (35). He agreed there was ""a very minor gouge on the bow on the right or starboard side"", which would not have been made by a log: p 349 (20). He described it as having been made by a hard object which did not dent the aluminium. His evidence was generally inconclusive, but was summarised by the trial judge in his summing up, at p 46.

25His Honour spent a little time with the evidence of Mr Rice, a civil engineer specialising in coastal engineering: Summing up, pp 43-45. He reported wave measurements taken from a buoy located off Cape Baily, on the coast north-east of Bate Bay. At the time of the incident, the median offshore wave height was about 1.5 metres: Tcpt, 27/04/11, p 335. Mr Rice concluded it would have been lower off Wanda Beach: p 336 (25). There was no evidence of freak wave activity.

26The defence case had three basic elements. First, the boat was six metres long and 2.1 metres wide: it should have been stable in normal conditions. Secondly, the applicant had navigated the boat successfully through the channels of Port Hacking, a fact inconsistent with gross impairment of his faculties by alcohol. Thirdly, unusual events can occur in the open sea. The case the defence had to meet was that although the night was dark with no significant moon, the winds were light, the swell was moderating and the boat was navigating well beyond the breaking surf. 

27The issues were not complex and they were carefully and more than adequately explained by the trial judge. The evidence as to the issues in dispute did not readily divide into categories. The contention that the trial judge failed to sum up the facts as they related to the ingredients of the offence and the statutory defence is without substance. The first ground must be rejected.

28To the extent that a ""collected resume"" of the evidence is different from a summary of the evidence as it relates to each ingredient of the defence, nothing further was required in this case. The second ground is also without substance and should be rejected.

29In his written submissions in this Court, counsel for the applicant formulated a two page direction which, it was submitted, should have been put to the jury. Much of it was; other parts were simply tendentious and were matters which one would expect to have been put in submissions for the defence at trial. It is not the task of the trial judge to provide an address in substitution for that delivered by experienced counsel.

30The applicant conceded, as was the case, that no complaint had been made of the summing up before the jury retired (although counsel were expressly invited to seek further direction - Summing up, 3/05/11, p 34) and that the further direction now proposed was not presented to the trial judge. He further acknowledged that the complaints about the summing up cannot be raised without leave, pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. However, counsel submitted that the errors were ""fundamental"", thereby leading to a miscarriage of justice, relying on Picken v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [19]-[22] (Mason P).

31Had the proposed direction been put to the trial judge, it is likely that there would have been debate as to its terms and the respects in which it advanced the defence case. It is by no means obvious that any part of it would have been accepted as requiring further direction. Although the applicant submitted that there was ""evidence that supported a finding of not guilty"", there was in fact remarkably little evidence which supported the defence, other than the evidence of the applicant. He had made various statements over the months as to the cause of the accident and effectively conceded, in a passage recited in the summing up, that he had no idea how the boat had come to capsize: Summing up, pp 19-21. He denied that he had drunk more than six or seven beers and denied that his consumption of alcohol had contributed in any way to the boat capsizing. He asserted that ""on the night I felt quite fine and alert and awake. I could keep a good look out, was able to stand up and function"": Summing up, p 22. The jury were left in no doubt as to the effect of his evidence: they did not have to accept it and the verdict demonstrates that they did not.

32There was no fundamental (or any other) error on the part of the trial judge; leave to rely upon the grounds sought to be raised in the application for leave to appeal against the convictions, pursuant to rule 4, should be refused. The application must be dismissed.

Director's appeal against sentence
33The second part of the proceedings involved the appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the inadequacy of the sentences imposed by the trial judge. The grounds of appeal identified by the Director asserted error on the part of the sentencing judge:

(1) in failing to assess adequately the moral culpability of the respondent;

(2) in not having appropriate regard to the guideline judgments in R v Jurisic and R v Whyte, and

(3) in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences of aggravated culpable navigation causing death and imposing a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.

It is convenient to deal with the complaint in respect of the guideline judgments first. The other grounds can be addressed as one.

(a) guideline judgments - dangerous driving
34In R v Reynolds; R v Small [2010] NSWSC 691, Michael Grove J sentenced two persons who had been responsible for navigating a vessel licensed to carry eight persons, but in fact holding 14 partygoers, when it collided in the early hours of the morning with a fishing boat on Sydney Harbour. Six people on the smaller boat died. Mr Small was in control at the time of the collision. Like the present offender, Mr Small was charged with multiple counts of dangerous navigation occasioning death. Grove J stated at [50]:

""The Crown is correct to submit that the offences of which Percy Small is convicted of dangerous navigation causing death are and can be treated as mirror offences of dangerous driving causing death. It is notorious that intense publicity has been given to the risks inherent in driving motor vehicles when affected by liquor or drugs. The circumstances of this case emphasize that the same risks exist when vessels are being navigated upon the waters.""

35Later in his judgment, at [96]-[97], Grove J referred to the guideline judgment in respect of dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm, R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252. That case identified a typical offence of dangerous driving causing death as involving a young offender of good character, causing death to an individual, the victim being a stranger, with little injury to the driver or the driver's intimates, accompanied by genuine remorse and a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. The sentence will depend upon the level of moral culpability. However, Spigelman CJ (Mason P, Barr, Bell and McClellan JJ agreeing) held that a ""custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement"": at [214]. Spigelman CJ then noted the second limb of the guideline which had been given in the earlier decision of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, in the following terms, at [215]:

""With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) ... should be exceptional.""

36The list of aggravating factors identified by the Chief Justice included the number of people put at risk and the degree of intoxication or substance abuse.

37In the present case there was a trial and no discount for a plea of guilty was available. Applying the guideline to dangerous navigation in Reynolds and Small, Grove J adopted a sentence of four years imprisonment, with a period of 12 months accumulation in respect of each offence subsequent to the first. As that resulted in an aggregate total term of nine years imprisonment, applying the totality principle, he reduced the overall sentence to a term of seven years and six months. He then fixed an overall period of mandatory custody of five years, with a balance of term of two years six months: at [101]-[102].

38The sentencing judge expressly referred to the approach of Grove J in Reynolds and Small and the use of the guideline judgments in Jurisic and Whyte. His Honour set out the passage at [50] from Reynolds and Small, noting the differences in approach which might be required in considering a case of dangerous driving as compared with dangerous navigation. He noted the importance of general deterrence and also the need to determine the moral culpability of the offender. After noting various factors including the absence of evidence as to how the boat capsized, his Honour continued:

""The offender is the only one who can throw light on this and from the inconsistencies in his various accounts I accept that he does not really know how the boat capsized. I further accept that this happened to him rather suddenly and was not the result of him intentionally navigating the boat in a dangerous fashion.
...

Looking at all of the circumstances and taking into account the absence of any further aggravating factors such as speeding, driving recklessly, showing off, falling asleep and so forth, I find that the offender's conduct does not involve a high degree of moral culpability but is more towards the middle of the range.""

39The judge noted that the offender had mounted ""a strong subjective case"" with a number of referees speaking of his ""hard work, honesty, trustworthiness and the fact that he is a good family man"". He also noted that the offender was 33 years of age and thus did not fit squarely within the typical offence referred to in the guideline judgments. He further accepted that the offender was ""unlikely to re-offend in this way in the future"". Correctly, his Honour accepted evidence of remorse, which was not to be discounted by the fact that he had pleaded not guilty. He then stated:

""Having considered all possible alternatives I am satisfied no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in these matters. In the guideline judgments regarding motor vehicle accidents where moral culpability was held to be high, a full time custodial sentence of less than three years in the case of a death has been held to generally be appropriate. In these matters I have found that the moral culpability is more towards the middle rather than the high, however this is an aggravated offence with the maximum penalty of fourteen years. Taking all the circumstances into account I find that each count deserves the same penalty. In each case that penalty, to adequately reflect the manifold purposes of punishment, should be two and a half years.""

40A degree of accumulation was found to be necessary, given that there had been the loss of two lives. This being the first time that the offender was in custody, the judge appropriately made a finding of special circumstances. The sentence imposed was one of three years with a minimum period of 18 months mandatory custody. He disqualified the offender from holding any boat licence for a period of five years.

41Ground 2, alleging failure to have appropriate regard to the guideline judgments, must be rejected. The sentencing judge gave careful attention to both the guideline judgments and the sentencing undertaken by Grove J in Reynolds and Small. He imposed sentences less than those imposed by Grove J and than might have been indicated by the general rule identified in Whyte, having regard to the fact that this was an aggravated offence. The principal reason for the variation was the finding that the degree of culpability was in the mid range, rather than the high range for the offences in question. If that finding is accepted, the variation from the guideline was within acceptable limits. 

42It follows that the appeal against sentence depends upon a challenge to his Honour's finding as to the level of moral culpability. 

(b) assessment of moral culpability
43The Director's submission in this respect identified 13 factors which it said the judge appeared to take into account in ameliorating the culpability of the offender. It is not necessary to set them out, as they were all undoubtedly matters taken into account in the process of assessing culpability. However, the judgment did not identify specific factors as those ameliorating or exacerbating the level of culpability. Some were clearly neutral, others clearly operated in one direction rather than another. The one matter of substance raised by the Director was the judge's statement that after the boat capsized, the offender removed his clothing, struggled to the shore and ""immediately set out to raise a 'hue and cry' and therefore did everything he could to try and have his two friends located"". His Honour further stated that the offender in this regard ""did not shirk his responsibilities"".

44The Director criticises this finding in the following passage in the written submissions at par 37:

""The fact that the respondent subsequently swam to shore and raised the alarm is not a matter that could operate to significantly mitigate his moral culpability. At trial the respondent gave evidence that he could see and hear the female victim and had the feeling that he wanted to go over and help her, but did not because 'the way she was panicking, I thought if I went over to her she would take me down as well.' ... The respondent told one of the police officers whilst he was the hospital on the morning of the incident that he new that the victims could not swim .... In his ERISP he told police that he was not too familiar with the swimming ability of the victims and did not ask them .... He was also aware that they were not wearing life jackets....""

45The sentencing judge expressly referred to the fact that they were not wearing life jackets; the context indicated that this was treated, correctly, as an aggravating circumstance, rather than one mitigating the level of culpability of the offender as the person in charge of the vessel. Further, his statement to police that ""they can't swim"" may not have indicated actual knowledge to that effect on his part. It may have been an inference drawn from the fact that Ms Amoa-Fesolai appeared to be ""panicking"" when she was in the water. Nevertheless, the complaint that he should not have been given credit for doing everything he could to assist his friends has merit.

46However, just as the Director objected to credit being given for the fact that the offender did not drive the vehicle and boat to the launching ramp, so limited weight should be given to his conduct immediately after the incident. It may be inferred from his initial view that he could not swim from the boat to the shore that he was not himself a strong swimmer.

47The Director further submitted that the absence of an aggravating factor did not lessen the culpability attaching to the offence. That is so, but when assessing levels of moral culpability, it is necessary to undertake a comparative exercise having regard to features which are present and those which are absent in the particular case, but which might occur in other cases. For example, the level of drinking in the present case, though undoubtedly serious, did not seem to equate with the level of drinking and drug taking revealed in Reynolds and Small. Nor did the offender entrust the navigation of his boat to an inexperienced person as did Mr Reynolds; nor was the fishing expedition entirely frivolous, in a way which some of the conduct revealed in Reynolds and Small might properly be so described.

48It is true that the level of alcohol in the offender's blood demonstrates a degree of irresponsibility which cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the degree of impaired functioning resulting from a particular level of alcohol in the blood undoubtedly varies from person to person. His Honour was entitled to take into account the fact that the offender had successfully navigated the boat from Yowie Bay to a point off Bundeena and at least part of the way across Bate Bay without any known difficulty. Further, the trial judge heard all of the evidence, including the evidence of the offender at the trial. He was in a good position to make an assessment of moral culpability. Neither the facts as found nor the reasoning in the judgment on sentence demonstrate manifest error in that regard. 

49Although the sentence was undoubtedly lenient, it is not one with which this Court should interfere. The Director's appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence should be dismissed.

Orders
50The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Refuse the offender leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise grounds challenging the summing up to the jury, in circumstances where no objection had been taken at trial.

(2) Refuse the offender leave to appeal against his convictions.

(3) Dismiss the Director's appeal against the inadequacy of the sentences imposed for the offences of dangerous navigation causing death.

2708260,Golding v R [2012] NSWCCA 76,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hislop J.
2HIDDEN J:  I agree with Hislop J.
3HISLOP J:  The applicant was charged with recklessly wounding another person contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for the offence is seven years imprisonment.  A standard non parole period of three years is applicable.
4The applicant pleaded guilty, was convicted and sentenced to two years three months imprisonment commencing on 21 February 2010 and expiring on 20 May 2012 with a balance of term of nine months expiring on 20 February 2013.  A charge of common assault was taken into account on a Form 1 in sentencing the applicant.  That offence occurred on the same occasion as the s 35(4) offence.
5The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  The ground of appeal is:
""The sentence imposed by his honour was manifestly excessive and in all the circumstances another sentence is warranted in law.""
6The facts of the offence were recounted by his Honour as follows:
""Mr Golding was working on fishing boats in the Northern Territory. He came to Sydney on 11 January last year [2010] on a break from work and in order to stay at a friend's house in Surry Hills. 
5. Mr Stewart of counsel called his client to give evidence. Mr Golding described how he had been drinking before he left Darwin and on the plane flight to Sydney, so that when he got off the plane he was, as he described, 'blind drunk'. He got to his friend's place in Surry Hills and started drinking again straight away. They and others were drinking all day. 
6. There was a young woman who lived at the same place who was in the group. Some sort of argument developed and the young woman left. 
7. But the young woman came back with a group of men who appeared at the front gate of where Mr Golding was staying and drinking. One of the men who had turned up said that he wanted to 'confront' the people in the house about what had happened. A couple of people from inside went outside and asked the group to leave. They did not. 
8. Then Mr Golding came out. The main man in the group outside invited Mr Golding to fight him. According to the summary of facts, Mr Golding then shouted, 'I'll sort this' and ran back into the house. He returned a moment later with a knife. He had brought the knife with him from Darwin and it was his filleting knife which he used for fishing. Mr Golding in evidence said that he had not said 'I'll sort this' but that he had said, 'We can sort this out .' I will accept for the purposes of sentencing that he said what he claimed he said in evidence before me. It does not make, in my opinion, a lot of difference to the seriousness of what then happened. 
9. The men outside were accompanied by a girl who was a teenager. She was sixteen. Mr Golding was outside wielding his knife around. He ran towards the man who had invited to fight him and stabbed towards his stomach and chest area. Fortunately he missed. He tried again to stab or slash this man, but the man jumped back. At this stage the teenage girl, as the summary of facts says, 'jumped between' the man and Mr Golding, and Mr Golding 'stabbed her in the left side of her chest, below her armpit'. The girl cried out and doubled over in pain, staggered a short distance and collapsed. She was bleeding heavily.
10. Police and ambulance were called. As it happened the teenage girl suffered what the facts describe as a 'deep penetration wound that punctured her left lung, causing it to collapse and causing breathing difficulties'. She required immediate surgery. She stayed in hospital in the intensive care unit for recovery. She required a tube for several days from her chest to provide fluid. 
11. Mr Golding's response to this predicament was to take himself to Adelaide. From there he took himself on to Perth and then back to Darwin. Police tracked him down in Darwin in the following month and he was arrested on 21 February 2010.""
7His Honour had regard to evidence from the Probation and Parole Service report, the applicant, his sister and a psychologist qualified on behalf of the applicant.  His Honour quoted from the Probation and Parole Service report as follows:
""[The applicant] is a 34 year old male who is currently single and has no dependants. 
His childhood has been described as dysfunctional and he grew up in a home where he was witness to physical and alcohol abuse, and did not have a positive male role model in his life as he was growing up. 
Although describing a pattern of binge drinking and abuse of illicit drugs, [the applicant] has expressed resistance towards addressing his abuse, having participated in numerous past interventions. The fact that he does not believe he requires assistance to address his substance abuse is of concern. Whilst the offender admits to the offences, he claims to have limited memory due to his level of intoxication. It is concerning that he has in the past advised this service that he has had limited memory of his offending due to being affected by substances."" 
8The Probation and Parole Service records indicate:
""a history of offending related to abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs. The report assessed him 'as unlikely to benefit from supervision by this Service, that is because of his past poor response'.""
9His Honour noted the applicant's criminal history which involved offences of violence as follows: 11/5/95 - Maliciously damage property; 24/8/95 Assault/resist officer (x 3); 15/4/96 - Robbery with corporal violence, Armed robbery; 4/9/97 - Common assault (x 2), Destroy or damage property; 5/12/97 - Assault with intent to rob, Resist officer (x 3); 17/11/05 - Assault officer (x 2); Resist officer; Intimidate officer; 25/1/06 - Destroy or damage property; Assault occasioning bodily harm; 18/2/10 - Common assault.  He also has three convictions (December 1995, June 2001 and 11 March 2004) for offences of possessing prohibited drugs.
10His Honour concluded that the subject offence occurred because the applicant introduced a knife into an already volatile situation.  He regarded the offence as lying in the middle of the range for objective seriousness and toward the middle of that range.  The main reason for making that finding was the seriousness of the injury.  It was a very serious injury, with significant immediate consequences.
11His Honour took into account the applicant's background but considered there should be a limit to the extent to which he did so, having regard to the applicant's age.  He took into account that the applicant had secured very good employment, was obviously a hard and well regarded worker.  However, he considered his prospects of rehabilitation were, at best, guarded.
12His Honour rejected a submission that he should find special circumstances on the basis the applicant would need assistance in dealing with alcohol.  His Honour rejected this submission given the applicant's age and his past attitude.
13His Honour concluded an appropriate overall sentence was four years imprisonment.  He allowed the applicant a discount of 25 percent for a plea entered at the earliest opportunity.  He took into account the matter on the Form 1, the maximum sentence for which was two years.
14Counsel for the applicant submitted that the injury to the victim was unintentional and caused, in part, by her intervention in the altercation and that the offence charged acknowledged there was a lack of intention in the applicant to cause harm.  However, as his Honour observed, it was the applicant who introduced the knife, it was he who wielded the knife in the presence of the ultimate victim and it was he who, by his actions, caused serious injury to the victim.
15It was submitted that the sentencing process had started from a point that was manifestly excessive and was indicative of a sentence commensurate with s 35(2) which carries a maximum penalty of ten years.  There is no substance in this submission.  His Honour clearly stated that he was concerned with the charge under s 35(4) for which the maximum penalty was seven years with a standard non parole period of three years.
16His Honour was not provided with statistics in relation to the offence.  However, the applicant conceded the relevant statistics indicated that the head sentence was within range and that the non parole period was at the higher end of the range.
17The applicant relied on Hyunwook Oh v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 as providing guidance as to the appropriate term.  In that case there was an application for leave to appeal relating to a sentence of one and a half years imprisonment with an additional term of one year.  It was submitted the offence in that case reflected far higher objective criminality than the present.  
18However, as the Crown submitted, a comparison between two unrelated cases does not establish that the sentence in one of them is erroneous.  In any event, the differences between Hyunwook and the applicant's case were notable:  Hyunwook was previously of good character and had no Form 1 matter taken into account.  In this case the applicant had a number of convictions for violence.  The Form 1 matter involved him threatening a juvenile male with the knife he used to wound the victim.  The need for personal deterrence to be reflected in the sentencing process was particularly heightened by the applicant's history of violent offending and his limited insight into its causes.  The Court of Criminal Appeal in Hyunwook noted that the offender had been dealt with leniently in the court below.
19It was also submitted that there was no evidence as to the injury sustained by the victim.  However, the injury was described in what was represented to be the agreed facts and was largely confirmed by the applicant in his evidence at the sentencing hearing.
20In my opinion, the sentence was an appropriate one when regard was had to the circumstances of the offending, the applicable maximum penalty and standard non parole period, the Form 1 offence and the heightened need for specific deterrence.
21This is a court of error.  Its powers in respect of an appeal on sentence are prescribed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  The Court will interfere with the sentence imposed in the court below only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error and then only if it forms the positive opinion that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed - R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79].
22In my opinion, error has not been established nor has it been established that some other sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed.  Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.
23I propose the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal granted;
2. Appeal dismissed.

2708268,R v Birkensleigh [2012] NSWSC 430,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, Jessica Tess Birkensleigh, was found guilty by a jury of an offence of robbery. The Crown case against her was not that she committed a robbery herself; rather that she was an accessory before the fact to a robbery committed by her co-offender, Rodney Boyd White. The maximum penalty that is applicable is imprisonment for 14 years.

Background

2The offender was born in September 1986. She was living with her family on the Gold Coast when she left home at the age of 16. It would seem from the evidence I heard in the sentence proceedings that she was rather headstrong at that time and had a strained relationship with her mother. She moved in to a friend's home. Her family subsequently moved to Victoria. She was in a relationship with a man from the age of 17, but tragically he died in a motorcycle accident just before the offender's 21st birthday in September 2007. 

3The offender was, understandably, grief stricken. Her family were not around to support her. Rodney White had been a friend of her fiancée. He and the offender became closer and commenced a relationship from about January 2008. They moved to Victoria to live with the offender's family at about this time. The family tolerated Mr White but did not approve of him. The offender's mother described him as ""bossy"", ""self-centred"" and a person ""who wouldn't take no for an answer"". In another sentencing judgment I have described White as a most belligerent, arrogant and manipulative person. 

4The offender said in her evidence that she was attracted to Mr White. He always had a lot of drugs and a lot of money and because of this, she believed that he was a drug dealer. There was something about his lifestyle that attracted her. She said she had always smoked cannabis but during the relationship she became addicted to speed. She said that the relationship with Mr White was ""good when it was good"" but they had their ups and downs. He was violent at times, physically and emotionally; usually when he had consumed too much drugs. He gave evidence in the trial that he used half a gram to a gram of methylamphetamine a day (T928.40). He also used cocaine. I do not know how truthful that account is because Mr White's evidence was of very dubious credibility. The offender said that he was very aggressive when he was angry and seemed unable to control himself. Her mother confirmed that he had a tendency to aggression.

5In September 2008, White asked the offender to move to Queensland with him. He told her that he had problems with his liver and needed a transplant. Treatment was available for him in Queensland. He also wished to be closer to his children who lived in that State. The offender agreed. She quit her job and the couple moved to Chinderah, just south of Tweed Heads, where White owned a cabin in a caravan park. Incidentally, White admitted in the trial that his claim that he needed a liver transplant was a lie.

6By December 2008, the offender was using speed and cannabis on a daily basis. It was White who provided her with the drugs.

7The offender knew Mr Saaid (""Sid"") Zaiter as an associate of White's. Mr Zaiter lived at Main Beach on the Gold Coast. She said in her evidence in the sentence proceedings that she thought that he was a drug dealer as well. She thought this because he was involved in the ""drug scene"" and she heard people saying that if ever you needed something you could go to Sid. She heard similar things said about White.

8There was evidence in the trial to the effect that Mr Zaiter was a major participant in the illicit trade in drugs. There were suggestions that he transported drugs from Sydney to the Gold Coast secreted within motor vehicles. 

9White himself admitted in evidence in the trial that he was involved in the supply of drugs but maintained that this had only occurred on a single occasion, in August 2008, when he brokered the sale by Mr Zaiter of a pound of speed for which he, White, received $15,000 from the proceeds.

Facts

10In December 2008, Mr White made various attempts to arrange a meeting with Mr Zaiter, ostensibly to obtain from him three pounds of methylamphetamine.

11At the time these events were occurring, the offender and White were planning to move back to Victoria. They were in the process of packing up their furniture and belongings in the cabin, and placing various items in a storage shed rented for Mr White in Casino.

12The meeting with Mr Zaiter was first scheduled to take place on the evening of 14 December. There was evidence that in anticipation of this meeting, Mr White put out a false story that he and the offender had separated. There was a text message to the offender asking her to repeat this story. The Crown contended that this was an indication that there was a plan to rob Mr Zaiter because anyone who tried to find Mr White after such a robbery might well try to locate him via his girlfriend.

13The meeting did not take place on 14 December. There was also evidence that Ms Birkensleigh had plans to fly to Melbourne on that day but missed her flight.

14The meeting with Mr Zaiter was re-scheduled for the afternoon of 15 December at Mr White's cabin at Chinderah. 

15The offender set herself an alarm/reminder on her mobile phone for the morning of 15 December. The reminder read ""Zip ties tape"". Although she did not give evidence in the trial, her evidence in the sentence proceedings was to the effect that Mr White had asked her to purchase these items for him.

16The offender and White arranged to stay with friends in Casino, Stephen and Sarah Orams. The Orams returned from a holiday at Coffs Harbour around the middle of the day on 15 December and the offender and White turned up at their home a short time later. 

17In the early afternoon, Mr Orams agreed to take the offender to the shops in Casino. She went to a hardware store and purchased a packet of 70 zip ties of varying lengths. It seems highly likely that she also purchased some tape. Later that afternoon, Mr Orams and Mr White went to the cabin at Chinderah. The purpose was to do some more packing but also for Mr White to meet with Mr Zaiter. However, Mr Zaiter did not attend. 

18The meeting was re-scheduled for 16 December. That morning, Mr Orams drove Mr White from Casino to Chinderah. They stopped in Lismore on the way and picked up Mr Ricky Humphries. Mr Humphries understood that Mr White was intending to engage in a drug deal and he was to back him up in the event that there was trouble.

19Mr Zaiter attended the cabin at some stage in the early afternoon. A violent fight took place between Mr White and Mr Zaiter. Humphries assisted White. It culminated in Mr White bashing Mr Zaiter either to death, or into unconsciousness and then suffocating him. 

20The ensuing events are rather complicated but they are in large part irrelevant to Ms Birkensleigh's offence. Suffice to say that Mr Zaiter's body was subsequently found on the floor of the cabin. His hands were bound behind his back with one or more zip ties and there was tape over his mouth and nose, making breathing impossible. The car in which he arrived at the cabin was taken to a remote location where the interior was searched and approximately three pounds of methylamphetamine was discovered and removed. The car was then completely destroyed by fire.

21Soon after the events in the cabin, White sent a text message to the offender, ""Jobs done ok on way back now"". She replied, ""Be safe, I love you oxoxox"".

22In an attempt to prevent detection, or to deflect a police investigation, White asked that the people involved in the events get rid of their mobile phones. At his request, the offender went to a mobile phone store in Casino on the afternoon of 16 December 2008 where she purchased four new phones. Ms Orams accompanied her. On the way to the store, the offender told Ms Orams, ""Something's happened and I think Rob's bashed someone"".

23On the morning of 19 December, Mr Orams took the offender to a travel agency in Casino where she asked to purchase a one-way ticket on the first available flight to Melbourne. The next available flight was the following morning.

24The offender flew to Melbourne from Ballina on the morning of 20 December. White hastily left the area as well and found his way to the home of friends at The Rock, near Wagga Wagga on 21 December. Later that day, Ms Birkensleigh and some members of her family arrived and took White with them to Victoria.

25White and the offender were arrested by police at Kamarooka near Bendigo on 4 September 2009. They were extradited to New South Wales. 

26Victorian police uncovered a considerable amount of expenditure by White and the offender between December 2008 and September 2009. There was evidence in the trial, which was not disputed, that they had bought various items such as accommodation, motor vehicles and a block of land. The total sum expended, all in cash, was in the order of $132,000. To cover their trail, both White and the offender had various identity documents in false names that they used in many of the transactions.

27It was the Crown case that these purchases of goods and services were made with money acquired through the distribution by White of the drugs that he had stolen from the deceased. There was evidence that on the night of 17 December 2008, White had spoken of his proposal to dilute the drugs in such a way that would yield a quantity with an ultimate street value of about half a million dollars.

28In summary, the Crown case, which was obviously accepted by the jury, was that Ms Birkensleigh knew that White was planning to rob the deceased. She assisted him in that endeavour by acquiring and providing him with the zip ties and the tape. Zip ties could really only have had one possible use in a robbery venture of this kind and that would be to bind the wrists or ankles of the victim. Tape could be used for binding, gagging or both. I am satisfied that the offender would have appreciated this. It must, therefore, have been apparent that considerable force and violence was a real prospect if the robbery was to be carried out as planned, or anticipated.

29The offender must have been aware that the object of the robbery was Mr Zaiter's drugs; no other conclusion is realistically open. I am satisfied that something in the order of three pounds of methylamphetamine was in fact taken. To put it into context, that is an amount in excess of the large commercial quantity prescribed in legislation concerned with drug trafficking. Those caught supplying such a quantity face a sentence of up to life imprisonment. The evidence does not establish that the offender was aware, prior to the robbery, that the drugs stolen would be of such a quantity. But she must have been well aware afterwards that White had considerably more money available to him as a result of what she had assisted him to do.

30A countervailing consideration in terms of the objective seriousness of the offence is that I am satisfied that the offender was subject to the domineering and manipulative personality of White. Mr Johnston, counsel for the offender, acknowledged that she must bear responsibility for her own actions, but submitted that this was a relevant consideration and reduced the level of her moral culpability to a degree. I accept that submission.

Subjective features

31The offender was born in September 1986, as I have mentioned, and was aged 22 at the time of the offence and is now 25.

32She has a criminal history that is limited to relatively minor drug possession and related offences in Queensland in December 2006 and March 2007. 

33I have already set out some detail of her background. Her family, with whom she has been living since she was released from custody, comprises her parents, her brother, and her niece who is severely disabled and requires around-the-clock care. She has another brother who resides in Tasmania.

34The offender remained in custody, having been refused bail, following her arrest until she was discharged at the conclusion of the committal proceedings on 16 March 2011. She said that being in gaol was the hardest time of her life. All of her family were in Victoria and they had limited opportunities to visit. She came to realise when she was in custody and away from prohibited drugs that she had become addicted. When her thinking became clearer she realised that she had not been leading the sort of life she wished to lead. She had always had full-time employment but her life of drug use with Rodney White was the antithesis of this and made her realise that she needed to change.

35The offender seems to have enthusiastically sought out and engaged in work in the custodial environment. She was eventually given jobs with greater responsibility. A ""Work Readiness Assessment"" report of 2 February 2010 describes her as a punctual, reliable, compliant worker who interacted well with others. She is also described as being ""well disciplined"", with good manners and attitudes; in short, ""an excellent worker"".

36Ms Anne Maria Folinazzo, the offender's mother, gave evidence that her daughter did not brood while in gaol. She said it was like she had woken up to herself and decided to get on with her life.

37The offender maintained contact with Rodney White by way of letters and telephone calls after going into custody. However, she claimed that after she was provided with the brief of evidence in about April 2010 and read it, she came to realise the detail of what he had been up to and she decided to cease any contact. She initially said that it was only then that she learned that he had killed someone. This is difficult to accept, given that she was arrested on 4 September 2009 and charged with being an accessory after the fact to a murder committed by White. She subsequently sought to explain that she did not recognise the name of the deceased, as she only knew Mr Zaiter as ""Chucky"". Overall, I found the offender's evidence to be credible, but on this aspect it was doubtful. I do, however, accept that she has not had any contact with White for about two years and does not intend to resume contact in the future.

38It appears that the offender now has a solid relationship with her family, including her mother who seems to be particularly supportive of her, notwithstanding the difficulties they have experienced in the past. She has a boyfriend, to whom she is engaged, but she said that she has not moved out to live with him because she wants to be able to play her role in caring for her disabled niece. The boyfriend has been living with the offender's family and Ms Folinazzo spoke favourably of him.

39Almost immediately after being released from custody in March last year the offender obtained employment, both a full-time and a part-time job. Her mother explained that the offender had debts that had accrued on her credit card from the time before she went into custody and she made it a priority to put her financial affairs in order. It would seem that aside from the period of time in which she was with Rodney White, the offender has demonstrated a strong work ethic. An illustration of this was when she was refused legal aid for her trial and people suggested that she should withdraw from employment so as to qualify. She declined to do so.

40The offender currently works for a firm of solicitors in Melbourne, mainly as a receptionist but she also assists with general administrative tasks. A testimonial from one of the senior lawyers at the firm speaks very positively about her worth as an employee. It is said that she has been open and forthright about the events of recent years and, if she obtains her liberty, she has a bright prospect for advancement within the firm.

41Her plans for the future include pursuing an Advanced Diploma of Legal Practice at TAFE. She wishes to obtain employment as a paralegal. She also hopes to marry at some stage and have children.

42I am satisfied that, aside from matters arising from her involvement with Rodney White, the offender has been a person of good character. Her prospects of rehabilitation are strong and there appear to be no reason to think that she will have any further involvement with the criminal justice system. I cannot, however, take into account that she is remorseful. She does not claim to be. She quite candidly said in her evidence that while she accepts the verdict of the jury, she does not agree with it. 

43Another matter for which the offender should get credit is the manner in which the trial was conducted. It was evident that there was a lot of co-operation between her legal representatives and the prosecuting authorities on the question of agreeing to facts, and consenting to statements being read and evidence being led. This obviated the need for the Crown to call a considerable number of witnesses and the associated expense. It also served to substantially shorten the time taken in the presentation of the evidence.

Other considerations

44The offence for which Ms Birkensleigh is to be sentence is somewhat unusual. The Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for the period April 2004 to March 2011 contain only three instances of robbery by way of aiding and abetting, or being an accessory before the fact. Such a small database is of no utility whatsoever. There would undoubtedly be many more instances of accessories before the fact being recorded in the statistics as robbery itself, given that such a person can be, as the offender was, indicted as a principal. In any event, the primary benchmark against which to assess any particular sentence is the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament, not the sentences that have been imposed in other circumstances on other offenders.

45The offence is of quite some seriousness. The additional feature that it involved one drug dealer robbing another drug dealer, adds emphasis to the importance that general deterrence must play in the assessment of the appropriate sentence. Other purposes of sentencing - punishment, denunciation, making the offender accountable for her actions - have a role to play; so too does promoting the rehabilitation of the offender. 

46I am satisfied that no sentence other than one of imprisonment is appropriate. The contrary has not been suggested.

47The offender was in custody, as I have mentioned, from 4 September 2009 until 16 March 2011. I was told that this amounts to a period of 558 days, a little over 18 months.

48Mr Johnston submitted that the time his client had served to date was sufficient punishment. In other words, I should backdate the sentence so as to permit the offender's immediate release to parole. It was then submitted that I should find special circumstances and thereby allow for a longer period on parole. If I was to accede to the latter submission, it would have the result that I would be imposing a longer total term than would otherwise be the case. In any event, I do not believe that the offender requires, or would benefit from, parole supervision.

49The Crown Prosecutor's submission was that the seriousness of the offence warranted there being a further period of custody. 

50Having regard to the seriousness of the offence, as I have found it to be, and the very favourable subjective case presented by the offender, I have concluded that I should impose the following sentence.

Sentence

Convicted.

Sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months. The sentence is to date from 2 November 2010 and expire on 1 May 2012.

I decline to set a non-parole period because there would be no utility in doing so.

2708272,R v HICKEY [2012] NSWDC 103,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On Sunday, 6 November 2011 Ms Victoria McCaffrey won a jackpot on a poker machine. I have got no doubt that she wishes now that she had not been so lucky because it was that short term gain which led to her being subject to a cold and callous crime, a crime which this offender and another man took advantage of both Ms McCaffrey's good luck and also her significant vulnerability. 
 
2Ms McCaffrey's has problems with her eyesight, to the extent that she is legally blind. She wears heavy prescription glasses. It is conceded that her behaviour, as observed by the offender, made him well aware of her problems with her sight. Thus when the offender, together with a co-offender named Stephen Venios, robbed Ms McCaffrey, he knew full well that he was robbing a highly vulnerable person. This itself is enough to demonstrate how objectively serious the offender's conduct was. 

3Ms McCaffrey was playing the poker machines at the Grosvenor Hotel. Present also in the hotel were the offender, his partner and his mother-in-law. Because of Ms McCaffrey's problems with her sight, she was at first unaware that she had won a jackpot. It was not until the offender's mother-in-law told her, that she learned of her then good fortune. She was generous with her winnings, buying drinks for other people in the bar and even buying a carton of beer for the offender's mother-in-law.

4She was given the proceeds in cash, $1,800, less some money that had been spent on alcohol. She put the money in her pocket and then headed home. 

5In the meantime the offender met up with his cooffender. The statement of facts reveals that the offender was seen making a telephone call, shortly after which the cooffender arrived on the scene. The inference, in the absence of any other evidence, that I would draw from that circumstance is that the offender was calling his cooffender probably and most likely in order that they could together commit the crime of robbing Ms McCaffrey, but in evidence today the offender denied that he had called his cooffender on the phone, claiming instead that he had called his mother. 

6The offender's case is that he was the junior partner in the offence which I will shortly describe. Given the state of the evidence that I have, I cannot find to the contrary. I pause in my recitation of the facts to speak about this circumstance. As I have said, I will be sentencing Mr Hickey on the basis that he was led into this offence by his cooffender, Mr Venios. Should Mr Venios ever be sentenced for his part, I have got little doubt that he will claim that he was led into his involvement by Mr Hickey. 

7That raises the very uncomfortable prospect of two offenders being sentenced for an offence, each on the basis that he was less involved than his cooffender. It is for this reason that it is usually better that cooffenders are sentenced together, so that that in this case the evidence of what Mr Hickey said would be admissible against Mr Venios and the evidence of what Mr Venios said, if anything, would be admissible against Mr Hickey. 

8I have got no doubt that the community is concerned, and in particular Ms McCaffrey will be concerned, at Mr Hickey being dealt with today without any evidence from Mr Venios, which perhaps might have contradicted what Mr Hickey said. It might have also been interesting to learn what any telephone records would say as to who the offender called shortly before Mr Venios turned up. 

9I at one stage gave some thought to adjourning this matter until Mr Venios's matter could be dealt with at the same time, however his matter is still in the Local Court and the indications are at this stage that he will be defending the matter and that a trial will be necessary in his case. There will therefore be a substantial delay before Mr Venios could be sentenced, (assuming of course that he is ultimately found guilty or pleads guilty). I appreciate that what I am describing is not a terribly satisfactory state of affairs, but it is the best that can be done in the present circumstances. 

10I want to emphasise that nothing I have said so far has meant that I will sentence Mr Hickey on anything other than the evidence which is presently before me, which I repeat suggests that he was led by Mr Venios, rather than the other way around. 

11Returning to the circumstances of this offence, once Mr Venios and the offender came together they followed Ms McCaffrey to her home. They are captured on CCTV for a large part of the afternoon and evening, so what they did is relatively easy to determine. Once Ms McCaffrey arrived at the building where she lived, the offender and his cooffender hid and watched the indicator on the lift, which Ms McCaffrey entered, in order to work out what floor she lived on. That way they were able to determine that she lived on level 10 and so the two men also went to level 10. 

12By the time they got there, Ms McCaffrey had unlocked her security door and the front door and was heading inside. Both these men approached Ms McCaffrey from behind. She was pushed forward a number of times. She stumbled and fell to the floor. One of them then straddled her legs and pinned her to the floor. She could only see that there were two men there and that they had their faces covered. They began to physically search through her pockets, removing the money which she had won a short time earlier. Once all the money was taken she heard one male say to the other, ""Just do it, just do it."" To add insult to injury, one of the men took off her glasses and threw them away. 

13She was no doubt terrified. She had earlier been the victim of a very serious offence and this circumstance must have clearly effected the way she was feeling that evening. She said, ""Just don't hurt me"". Rather than reassuring her, one of the men replied, ""I know you've got more, where is it?"" This could only have added to the concern that Ms McCaffrey was feeling as to what might happen to her. She repeated, ""Just don't hurt me"" and told the offender that she did not have any more. 

14Finally the two men left the apartment. The offender was arrested a short time later, after the CCTV footage from the hotel and Ms McCaffrey's apartment building were viewed by police. The offender declined to be interviewed when police approached him. He was arrested on 11 November 2011 and has been in custody since then. 

15To say that the offence is objectively serious significantly understates the events that I have just described. To rob a blind woman, especially when you know that the woman is blind, is, as I earlier described, a cold and callous crime. 

16A victim impact statement was read on behalf of Ms McCaffrey which sets out eloquently the harm she has suffered. Part of the harm she did suffer was as a result of the circumstance that she had earlier suffered as a victim of a very serious offence. The offender was not to know that. Whilst the consequences of an offence can be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed upon an offender, the concept of foreseeability limits which consequences can be taken into account. Any woman with visual impairment to the extent that Ms McCaffrey suffers would suffer harm as the result of an offence of this kind. That is the harm that I will take into account when sentencing the offender. 


17I earlier noted that it was an understatement to say that this offence was serious. It is also an understatement to say that the offender had a troubled background. The awful beginnings of this troubled background can be very simply stated. His mother murdered his father. As a result, he went to live with his grandparents. His grandmother died when he was thirteen and his grandfather died a year later. His grandparents were a very positive influence on his life. They did not abuse substances, nor were they violent or aggressive, but their stable support was lost to him at a very early age. His close cousin died in the 2004 Redfern riots in circumstances which are extremely well known. He has therefore lost a lot of people who are close to him. It is obvious that these losses had a significant effect upon him. 

18He moved from the country to the city where, as is distressingly common, he became involved with other young people with little to do apart from drink, take drugs and commit crimes. He adopted that lifestyle. He began to drink. He began to take drugs and he began to commit crimes. 

19He has an extensive criminal record, including priors for robbery offences as a juvenile. This offence, and I have got no doubt others on his record as well, was committed because Mr Hickey wanted to get some money so that he could satisfy his various addictions. He wanted money to buy cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis and cocaine, and he saw an easy way to get it. 

20He has had some success in the past, being able to give up his use of alcohol and drugs at times, but these have been ultimately unsuccessful as his involvement in the present offence demonstrates. He has some plans for the future. He is considering moving back to the country, where he has an aunt and uncle. He is considering completing year ten. He has a partner, and three children. He wishes upon his release from custody to live with them. 

21He expressed his remorse to the psychologist. He was able to empathise with the way Ms McCaffrey must now be feeling. I cannot find that his prospects for rehabilitation are good, as a lot will depend on how he responds to opportunities which are offered to him upon his release from custody. It is to be hoped that he will respond positively to them. If he does not, I have little doubt that he will commit further crimes and become ultimately one of those sad young men who measures out his life in court dates and custodial sentences. He is still a relatively young man. He has the opportunity upon his release from custody to take steps to put his offending ways behind him. Whether he takes those opportunities remains to be seen. 

22The offender says that he committed this offence whilst he was intoxicated. In some cases that can be a mitigating feature, in other cases it is not. The evidence before me establishes that his intoxication reduced his ability to reason about what he was doing and so I will regard it as a mitigating feature in this case, reducing his moral culpability, albeit by a relatively small amount. Even highly intoxicated people know that it is wrong to rob a blind woman who has just had some success on the poker machines. 

23Of course I was referred to the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline judgment in submissions by both sides. Notwithstanding that that guideline was for an offence of armed robbery, it has been held that it is a useful guideline also for the appropriate sentence in cases of this kind, namely robbery in company. Of course there are some differences between the offence postulated in the Henry guideline and this. Working in the offender's favour is that his plea of guilty was not of limited utility, it was an early plea of guilty. I would discount the sentence I would otherwise impose by twentyfive per cent to reflect that circumstance. (To make it clear, I do not mean twentyfive per cent less than the Henry guideline sentence because that itself was postulated on a late plea of guilty).

24Although the maximum penalties are the same, it is a relevant circumstance that the offender has not been dealt with for armed robbery. On the other hand, the offender does not have a limited criminal history and this offence occurred in the victim's own home, a circumstance not at all taken into account by the Court of Criminal Appeal in setting the Henry guideline sentence of four to five years. 

25The Crown opposed any finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. I am going to make a finding in the offender's favour because of his age, and because of, most importantly, the circumstance that if Mr Hickey can deal with his problems, particularly those relating to substance abuse, he will be less likely to commit crimes in the future. Ultimately the purpose of sentencing is to protect the community. In this case, at Mr Hickey's age, that purpose is best achieved by extending him some leniency, which would certainly not be available to him were he to continue committing offences. 

26Another reason that I will make a finding of special circumstances is this. The evidence clearly establishes that the best way that Mr Hickey can be put back on the right path is if he enters a long term residential rehabilitation program. Because of the length of the sentence I am about to announce, it is not me who sets the conditions of parole, but the Parole Board. Nevertheless I make it a very firm recommendation that Mr Hickey is not to be released to parole unless he immediately enters a long term residential rehabilitation program and satisfactorily completes it. It is my recommendation that unless Mr Hickey is willing to do that, parole should not be granted to him immediately at the conclusion of his nonparole period. 

27It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence has to reflect the objective gravity of an offender's conduct. Notwithstanding Mr Hickey's terrible upbringing and the position he found himself at the age of thirteen, a long sentence is required to meet that fundamental rule. 

28The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of three years to date from 11 November 2011. I set a head sentence of six years. The nonparole period will expire on 10 November 2014, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		23 July 2012",2012-05-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708279,O'Brien v Hutchinson [2012] NSWSC 429,"Judgment
1The plaintiff seeks relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 in respect of a refusal by the second defendant, his Honour Magistrate Grogan, to make a costs order against the first defendant under s  213(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
2The first defendant, Senior Constable Wayne Hutchison, charged the plaintiff with an offence under s  33 of the Impounding Act 1993.  On 23  November 2010 his Honour dismissed the charge.  His Honour submits to any order of this Court, save as to costs.
Nature of review
3Sections 212 to 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provide:
""212   When costs may be awarded
(1)  A court may award costs in criminal proceedings only in accordance with this Act.
...
213   When professional costs may be awarded to accused persons
(1)  A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.
...
214   Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity
(1)  Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following:
(a)  that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,
(b)  that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,
(c)  that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,
(d)  that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.
(2)  This section does not apply to the awarding of costs against a prosecutor acting in a private capacity.
(3)  An officer of an approved charitable organisation under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 is taken not to be acting in a private capacity if the officer acts as the prosecutor in any proceedings under that Act or section 9 (1) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2003.""
4There is no express right of appeal conferred from a decision to refuse to make an order under s 213.  Hence the plaintiff invokes s 69 of the Supreme Court Act.  There is no privative or ouster clause in respect of a decision under s 213.  It follows that relief under s  69 is available on the grounds discussed in Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58;  (1995) 184  CLR  163 at pp 175 - 176 including jurisdictional error and error of law on the face of the record.
5The ""record"" is usually confined to any documentation which initiates the application, the pleadings (if any) and the orders made (Craig at 182).  In this state, the definition of the record has been expanded to include the reasons of the inferior court or tribunal (s  69(4) of the Supreme Court Act;  see Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1;  (2010) 239  CLR 531 at [89]).  Where jurisdictional error is alleged the Court can, subject to the applicable procedural and evidentiary rules, take account of any relevant material placed before it (Craig at 176).
6The concept of jurisdictional error on the part of an inferior court was discussed in Craig at 176 to 180 and in Kirk at [71] - [75].  The discussion in Kirk emphasises that it is neither necessary nor possible to mark the boundaries of jurisdictional error.  Care should be taken to avoid ""providing a rigid taxonomy of jurisdictional error"" (Kirk at [73]).  That said, one formulation of jurisdictional error which arises on the plaintiff's case is the statement in Craig at 177 as follows:
""An inferior court falls into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that a jurisdiction does exist.  Such jurisdictional error can infect either a positive act or refusal or failure to act.  Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of the writ where it makes an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits of jurisdiction.""
7The power conferred by s 213(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act cannot be exercised in a case where there is a prosecutor acting in a public capacity unless the Court is ""satisfied"" of any one or more of s 214(1)(a) to (d).  The formation of the opinion in s 214(1) is a ""limit"" on the function or power conferred by s 213(1) as discussed in the above passage from Craig.  It follows that, in a case where a costs order was refused, jurisdictional error will be established if the plaintiff can establish that the Local Court misapprehended the limits placed on it by s 214 (see for example De  Varda v Constable Stengord (NSW Police)  [2011] NSWSC 868 at [32] to [33], per Davies J).  Having stated this, six matters should be kept in mind.
8First, the formulation of jurisdictional error that I have extracted from Craig involves establishing that the inferior court ""misapprehended"" the limits on its power.  Just because the matters listed in s 214(1) have a jurisdictional quality does not mean that the role of this Court is to determine whether any of them were met and, if so, conclude that there was jurisdictional error on the part of the Local Court in failing to act.  The plaintiff must identify a ""misapprehension"" by the Local Court as to the limits on its power, not a mere disagreement with the Local Court's conclusion as to those limits.  Unless the intention is clearly expressed, legislation will not be construed so as to make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts as distinct from the court's opinion or determination that the facts exist (Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7;  (1938) 59 CLR 369 at 391, per Dixon J]).  The deployment by the legislature of the word ""satisfied"" in s 214(1) puts beyond doubt that there is no such contrary intention.
9Second, a number of aspects of s 214(1)(a) to (d) involve the exercise of a normative judgment on the part of the Local Court.  For example, the Local Court must make an assessment as to whether something was ""unreasonable"", ""improper"" or that there were ""exceptional circumstances"".  In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194 the Full Court of the Federal Court noted that conclusions on matters of ""opinion or policy or taste"" may be ""very much a matter of opinion and thus not readily susceptible to review for error of law"" (at 199G).  Similarly, conclusions by the Local Court as to whether or not failure to take some particular step in the investigation process was ""unreasonable"" or not can be very much a matter of opinion.  In such a case, the task of demonstrating a misapprehension in the Craig sense is that much more difficult.
10Third, an erroneous construction of provisions such as ss  214(1)(a) to (d) will sometimes be apparent on the face of the lower court's reasons. If so the existence of both an error of law and a jurisidictional error will be established.  In some cases a misconstruction may only be apparent from an examination of the structure of the lower court's reasons. In other cases a party may point to a disparity between the facts as found and the lower court's conclusion as demonstrative of error. However, it must be remembered that a number of phrases in s 214(1) are not technical legal phrases but words which have a ""common understanding"". To demonstrate legal error in this latter type of case it would have to be demonstrated that, on the facts as found, no other conclusion was reasonably open other than that the criteria was established (Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16;  (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7;  Williams v Bill Williams Pty Ltd [1971] 1 NSWLR 547 at 557;  Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12;  (2001) 202 CLR 439 at [24] to [28], per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ).
11Fourth, a relevant misapprehension is not demonstrated by pointing to a list of matters the court could have, or even should have, taken into account but did not or by pointing to matters the court did take into account, but should not have.  In Craig at 180, the High Court held:
""... a failure by an inferior court to take into account some matter which it was, as a matter of law, required to take into account in determining a question within jurisdiction or reliance by such a court upon some irrelevant matter upon which it was, as a matter of law, not entitled to rely in determining such a question will not ordinarily involve jurisdictional error.""
12It is only if one took the further step of inferring that, because the inferior court took into account some irrelevant matter or failed to take into account some relevant matter, it thereby misconstrued a limit on its power would any contention based on a failure to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant considerations suggest the existence of jurisdictional error.
13Fifth, the failure to take into account a relevant matter or the taking into account of an irrelevant matter by an inferior court might constitute an error of law on the face of the record even if it does not constitute a jurisdictional error.  However, the relevant transgression would have to be apparent on the face of the ""record"".  It could not be demonstrated by pointing to a wider set of materials.  Moreover, the relevant ""matter"" would have to be a factor or consideration that as a ""matter of law"" the lower court was required to consider, or exclude, as the case maybe.  Such matters are ascertained from the legislation governing the case in question (see in the context of an administrative decision:  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30;  (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [73] to [74], per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ).  They are not identified by preparing a list of ""facts"" that it is said should have been considered but were not, or were considered but should not have been.
14Sixth, the material placed before me included the transcript of an ex tempore judgment of the second defendant.  It is well recognised that, given the prodigious workload carried by the Local Court, the transcript of such reasons are not to be construed strictly.  Instead their substance is to be examined to see whether the correct test was applied (Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 478 - 479A, per Kirby P).
Background
15Tendered before me was the transcript of the Local Court hearing of the charge and the application for costs.  Also tendered was the prosecution brief of evidence and certain letters written to the prosecutor by the solicitor for the plaintiff prior to the hearing.  This material was tendered on the hearing of the costs application.  I admitted this material provisionally under s 57 of the Evidence Act 1995.  At the time I admitted it I indicated that I would address its ultimate evidentiary status after I had heard final submissions.  Having heard those submissions, I confirm that I have admitted those exhibits in the proceedings.  While only the transcript of the court's reasons for refusing the costs application and the transcript recording the formal application for costs form part of the ""record"", the balance of the material is relevant to so much of the plaintiff's case that alleges jurisdictional error (see [5]).
16The plaintiff is the owner and operator of two adjacent farming properties in the Lightning Ridge area known as ""Neirbor Plains"".  A Mr Parkins and a Ms Spooner operated neighbouring properties known as ""Wilgo"", ""Gurson"" and ""Wyoming"".  From June 2009 the plaintiff agisted a number of ""Dorper"" sheep on Neirbor Plains.
17Subsection  33(1) of the Impounding Act provides that it is an offence for a person who ""causes or permits an animal under his or her control to trespass in a place (other than a public place)"".  The plaintiff was charged that he did between 9.00am and 11.00am on 22 December 2009 at Lightning Ridge cause or permit Dorper sheep ""under his control"" to trespass on Wyoming, Gurson and Wilgo, which were said not to be public places.
18The proceedings were heard on 22 and 23 November 2010 in the Local Court at Lightning Ridge.  At the close of the prosecution case the plaintiff's solicitor submitted that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case.  His Honour accepted that submission.  His Honour found:
""I am not satisfied that there is evidence that the sheep seen by Mr  Smith on 22 December 2010 were sheep that were under the control of Mr O'Brien on that day.  I am not satisfied because of Mr  Smith's acquiescence and realisation of the different terminology of 'some sheep' to 'those sheep'.""
19Mr Smith was the Rangelands Management Officer for the western region of New South Wales.  His responsibilities included the monitoring of land use by farmers and graziers who own western land leases.  Acting on a complaint from Mr Parkins he had travelled to Wyoming on 15  December  2009.  He inspected parts of Wyoming.  His inspection revealed that there had been an entry onto Wyoming of Dorper sheep.  He returned on 22  December 2009 and performed another inspection with Detective  Hutchinson.  He had observed similar damage to the pasture and internal and boundary fencing on Wyoming.  He observed a number of Dorper sheep on Wyoming on that occasion.  The concession referred to by his Honour involved Mr Smith accepting that the Dorper sheep he saw on 22  December 2009 were not necessarily the sheep he had seen on 15  December 2009.
20The transcript records that following the dismissal of the charge the plaintiff's solicitor made an application for costs under s  213 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  The transcript does not record the submissions that were made, although it is apparent that reliance was placed on each of ss  214(1)(b), (c) and (d).  I will address his Honour's reasons in relation to each of those subparagraphs.  His Honour was not satisfied that any of the grounds were made out.  Accordingly, his Honour did not consider whether to exercise any residual discretion in s  213 that may exist either to grant or refuse a costs application in circumstances where one or more of ss  214(1)(a) to (d) had been established.
Subsection 214(1)(b):  Proceedings initiated without reasonable cause
21In relation to s 214(1)(b) the transcript records his Honour's reasons as follows:
""The application is made with reference to three of the four paragraphs of s 214(1), namely (b), (c) and (d).  214(1)(b) is on the basis that costs should be awarded because the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner.  I am satisfied that there was an extensive investigation in relation to the matter.  That can be borne out by the number of statements that were provided in the brief and also by the statement of exhibit 1 in the hearing and that is of Detective Senior constable Wayne Hutchinson.
Investigation by Detective Hutchinson involved a number of persons and covered as it so happened a number of months of observations of witnesses.  The witnesses provided information concerning sheep on the property known as Wyoming, that is a collective name, from around it would appear July 2009 up till the date of the actual alleged offence and passing that date.
The fact that some people were not interviewed does not of itself indicate that the investigation was initiated without reasonable cause.  There was sufficient evidence of observations made before the date of the alleged offence and the providence of the sheep on these occasions was established by the admissions of the defendant, the actions of the defendant, the observations witnesses and by conversations with other witnesses, including that of Allan Crawford.
These dates however were not the relevant date.  There were dates prior to and inclusive of 15 December.  When I review the evidence I am not satisfied that there is any evidence of that faith and there is no evidence of the investigation being conducted in an improper manner.  There was evidence of control of the sheep, not necessarily the sheep as seen by Peter Smith.  Mr Bendall said he had 4000 to 6000 sheep on agistment with the defendant at 40 cents per head.
When I review the evidence and the submissions I am not satisfied grounds contained in s 214(1)(b) have been satisfied.""
22Although his Honour expressly rejected the contention that the proceedings were initiated in bad faith or conducted in an improper manner, it is not clear that the plaintiff had made any submission to that effect.  However, it is clear that the plaintiff had submitted that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause.
23Mr Steirn SC with whom Mr Denman of counsel appeared on behalf of the plaintiff contended that his Honour failed to apply the proper test.  In particular it was submitted that his Honour had failed to make any examination of the quality, or lack thereof, of the evidence which the police had gathered at the time of laying the charge.  Mr Steirn SC referred to the decision of Hidden J in JD v DPP & 3 Ors [2000] NSWSC 1092.
24I am not satisfied that there was such a failure to apply a proper test in this respect.  His Honour recounted the investigative steps taken by the first defendant.  His Honour noted that there was evidence of the Dorper sheep trespassing onto Wyoming on dates prior to the date of the alleged offence.  The transcript records his Honour referring to the ""providence"" of the sheep being established by ""admissions"" of the plaintiff.  I take this to be a reference to the ""provenance"" of the sheep on those occasions and admissions by the plaintiff that he had an ability to control the sheep that had trespassed on those occasions.
25His Honour accepted that there was a defect in the prosecution case but did not accept that the defect that was identified meant that the proceedings had been initiated without reasonable cause.  Given the history of the trespassing of Dorper sheep onto Wyoming and the admissions by the plaintiff, his Honour considered it was understandable that Mr Smith and the first defendant had proceeded on the basis that the Dorper sheep seen on Wyoming on 22 December 2009 were sheep under the plaintiff's control.  This does not reveal any failure to apply a proper test on the part of his Honour.   His Honour was alive to the potential difference between a case that failed at a prima facie level and a proceeding that could be characterised as having been initiated without reasonable cause.
26As noted, the plaintiff referred to the judgment of Hidden J in JD.  In that case the magistrate stated that he had to be satisfied that the investigation fell ""grossly below optimum standards"" before concluding it was unreasonable.  The plaintiff relied on his Honour's findings at [31] to [32] that the magistrate in that case had thereby applied the wrong test.  Hidden J added, (at [31]):
""The test is purely objective.  To find that the conduct of investigation of a particular case was unreasonable does not necessarily impugn the general competence, far less the integrity, of those responsible for it.""
27This part of JD addressed the test now found in subsection 214(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act which was not relied on in this case.  In any event there is nothing to suggest that the same error was made by his Honour in this case.
28The balance of the submissions in relation to his Honour's findings in relation to subsection 214(1)(b) contend that his Honour took into account certain irrelevant facts or failed to take into account relevant facts in the course of forming an opinion as to whether the subsection was satisfied.  For the reasons I have outline above, these contentions do not allege either an error of law on the face of the record or jurisdictional error.  Nevertheless, I will address them to determine if they support a contention that the second defendant misconstrued subsection 214(1)(b).
29The irrelevant matters that it was said that his Honour took into account in addressing subsection 214(1)(b) were:
""... that there was an ""extensive investigation"" on the basis that a large number of statements had been taken and omitting the fact that the first defendant had failed to gather any direct evidence of existence of the sheep on ""Wyoming"" or the control by the accused of those sheep on 22 December 2009 when considering whether the ground in s 214(1)(b) has been made out.
By taking into account the observations of witnesses and admissions by the defendant in relation to sheep under the control of the defendant in the months before 22 December 2009 when those admissions were totally inadmissible and thus not evidence, having been ruled by the second defendant as being ""too remote in time"" and the ""unfair prejudice was not outweighed by the probative value of this evidence"" ... 
By taking into account the inadmissible observations of Mr Bendall that Mr Bendall had 4000 to 6000 sheep on agistment with the defendant when Mr Bendall neither gave evidence nor was a witness in the prosecution, when considering whether the ground in s 214(1)(b) had been made out.""
30The first and second of these matters are similar to the complaint made that his Honour applied a wrong test in relation to s  214(1)(b).  I have explained his Honour's reasoning process above.  It was not irrelevant to his Honour's assessment of whether he was satisfied that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause to consider the material gathered by the first defendant about events occurring prior to 22  December 2009.  The fact that much of this material was found to be inadmissible at the hearing did not render it irrelevant to the question of whether, at the time of the initiation of the proceedings, there was reasonable cause.  Neither of these contentions rises to the point of demonstrating a misconstruction of s  214(1)(b) by his Honour.
31The same observations apply in relation to the third matter, namely the observations of Mr Bendall that he had 4000 to 6000 sheep on agistment with the plaintiff.  Mr Bendall told this to the first defendant but the latter's recitation of that conversation was ruled inadmissible as hearsay.  Apparently Mr Bendall had advised the first defendant that he did not wish to provide a statement because he did not want to jeopardise his ability to agist his sheep with the plaintiff.  The fact that the first defendant was told by the owner of the sheep that he had 4000 to 6000 Dorper sheep on agistment with the plaintiff was not irrelevant to the question of whether or not the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause.  His Honour's reference to it does not indicate any misconstruction of subsection 214(1)(b).
32The plaintiff also submits that in addressing subsection 214(1)(b) his Honour did not take into account the following:
""There was no evidence from anyone (apart from Smith) that there was any Dorper sheep trespassing on Wyoming on 22 December 2009;  
The evidence of Smith could not prove that the sheep he saw on 22 December 2009 were under the control of O'Brien, and there was no evidence of the origin of the Dorper sheep seen by Smith on 22 December 2009.
There was no evidence of who had control of the sheep on ""Wyoming"" on 22 December 2009 and
Thus there was no evidence that O'Brien had control of those sheep.
There was, even taking the prosecution case at its highest no prima facie case against the plaintiff, neither at the time of charging (11 March 2010) or at the close of the prosecution case.""
33Further, the plaintiff submis that had his Honour taken these matters into account he ""would have granted cost to the plaintiff"".
34Again, as formulated, these complaints do not grapple with the limits on this Court's supervisory jurisdiction.  They travel no higher than a re-statement of that which his Honour had already accepted prior to hearing the costs application, namely that there was no prima facie case against the plaintiff.  However, as I have explained, his Honour considered that the combination of the observations of trespassing Dorper sheep, admissions by the plaintiff on dates prior to the date of the charge and the evidence of Mr Smith was such that he was not satisfied that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause.  His Honour's conclusion does not reveal any misconstruction of subsection 214(1)(b) and was otherwise open (cf Vetter).
35The challenge to so much of his Honour's reasoning that concerned subsection 214(1)(b) is not made out.
Subsection 214(1)(c):  Unreasonable failure to investigate any relevant matter
36Two parts of his Honour's reasons for dismissing the costs application addressed subsection 214(1)(c).  They were as follows:
""I then turn to s 214(1)(c) where that indicates that costs may be awarded when the court is satisfied that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate or to investigate properly any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that for any other reason the proceedings should not have been brought.
It is an interesting section which has not been subject to much judicial review it would appear.  When one reads that section it is an inclusive section.  It states that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate or to investigate properly any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or for any other reason the proceedings should not have been brought.  What is the evidence which suggested that the accused person might not be guilty?  It seems like there must have been an investigation first to find out that that evidence was of such a nature which would suggest the defendant was not guilty.
The evidence of Peter Smith which is exhibit 3 and his oral evidence was that he thought the sheep he saw on 22 December were the sheep that he saw on 15 December.  It is granted that there was no further identification of the sheep on 22 December and that of itself led to no prima facie case being established.  Mr  Smith drew a conclusion and an assumption that was not available at law to the requisite proof.
The prosecutor investigated the matter by obtaining statements from a number of people including Peter Smith.  Much investigation was excluded by the court as being too remote in time and that was done on the basis that there were too many intervening opportunities that could have been present but unknown between early 2009 and the date of the alleged incident, such that the unfair prejudice was not outweighed by the probative value of the evidence.
I will come back to 214(1)(c).
...
I return to s 214(1)(c).  The prosecutor in the form of Detective Senior Constable Hutchinson was entitled in my opinion to rely upon the evidence of Ms Spooner Parkins and Mr Smith when preparing the brief and proceeding to and deciding to proceed with the proceedings.  Certainly as I stated at prima facie level an investigation of the sheep seen on 22 February, 22 December by way of ear tags if they were in existence or other outstanding features may have brought about a different conclusion to the proceedings.  However I am not satisfied that those matters raised in 214(1)(c) have been established.  I am not satisfied that the prosecution unreasonably failed to investigate the matter.""
37The plaintiff contends that his Honour applied the wrong test in addressing subsection 214(1)(c) in that his Honour ""failed to examine the flaws in the investigation ... and consider any further inquiries which should have been undertaken, when exercising his discretion"".  There is no discretion being considered at the point of addressing subsection 214(1)(c).  Otherwise, his Honour did not make the error that is alleged.  His Honour considered whether further inquiries should have been undertaken.  His Honour specifically adverted to whether any investigation of any ""ear tags if they were in existence or other outstanding features"" of the sheep ""may have brought about a different conclusion to the proceedings"".  In dismissing the charge his Honour had noted that there was ""no inspection made of the sheep seen on 22 December to determine whether they were tagged.""  I refer to this further below.
38The plaintiff pointed to a number of facts he claims his Honour should have but failed to take into account when addressing subsection 214(1)(c), namely:
""The first defendant has failed to obtain evidence from any eye witness, including himself, Parkins or Spooner, who might have seen Dorper sheep on ""Wyoming"" on 22 December 2009.
The first defendant failed to take a statement from Smith of the sheep Smith saw on 22 December 2009 which identified those sheep to establish that they were in fact under the control of O'Brien.
The first defendant failed to inspect or cause to be inspected the PITs on the sheep seen by Smith or to take photographs of the sheep, or establish any evidence to prove that those sheep were under the control of O'Brien.
The first defendant failed to obtain evidence that ... O'Brien was in possession of any Dorper sheep at the time of the offence.  
The first defendant failed to take a statement from J Brown to rebut the possibility that any Dorper sheep seen on ""Wyoming"" on 22 December 2009 had come from ""Warrengulla"" and were under the control of O'Brien and not J Brown.
The first defendant failed to take steps to rebut the possibility that any Dorper sheep seen on ""Wyoming"" on 22 December 2009 were from properties other than the plaintiff's property.""
39There are a number of matters to note about these contentions in addition to the points made at [11] to [13] above.
40First, I cannot be satisfied that most of the submissions stated above were ventilated before his Honour.  I have adverted to the difficulty with the transcript of the submissions of the costs application.  The only matter that was not investigated that his Honour referred to was the presence of ear tags.  That is the only alleged failure that I infer that his Honour was asked to address.  Thus the alleged failure of his Honour to address the other matters goes nowhere in terms of establishing any misconstruction of subsection 214(1)(c).
41Second, for the sake of completeness I note that these contentions misstate the evidence of Mr Smith.  Mr Smith was a witness who had seen Dorper sheep on Wyoming on 22 December 2009.  His statement records that after he performed the inspection on 22 December 2009 and saw Dorper sheep he did the following:
""After this inspection I drove to Neirbo Plains where I spoke to Gerard O'Brien.  He gave an undertaking to me that he had contacted the owner of the sheep and told him to move them.  The owner of the sheep had told O'Brien that agistment paddocks were hard to find due to dry weather and it could take some time to accomplish this.""
42This paragraph was objected to on the hearing of the charge and his Honour rejected it.  However, it clearly was material from which it was open to a prosecutor to conclude that as at 22 December 2009 the plaintiff had the ability to control the Dorper sheep on Wyoming, even if it was by giving a direction to the owner.
43The issue of whether the first defendant should have inspected the trespassing sheep for tagging is a matter that has troubled me.  Clause  20 of the Stock Diseases Regulation requires that an owner of, inter alia, sheep must ensure the sheep are identified in accordance with cl  19 before stock leaves property on which it is kept, on their arrival in New South Wales or if directed to do so.  The form of identifier must at least include the ""relevant identification particulars of the stock"" (19(a)) which is defined as the ""property identification code of the property on or in respect of which the sheep"" have been identified (17(1)(b)).
44His Honour accepted that ""if [tags] were in existence"" they ""might have brought about a different conclusion to the proceedings"".  Nevertheless his Honour found that the failure to inspect the ear tags on 22 December 2009 did not constitute an unreasonable failure to investigate any relevant matter on the part of the prosecution.  I construe his Honour's reasons as stating that this failure did not rise to the level of being unreasonable because the first defendant, not unreasonably although wrongly, concluded that he could establish the identify of the trespassing Dorper sheep by reference to events in the past in the circumstance that the two sets of properties adjoined each other.  Consistent with [9] above his Honour has made a normative assessment that the failure to take that step was not ""unreasonable"".  Although this was a matter upon which minds may reasonably differ, it does not reveal any misapprehension of subsection 214 (1)(c), and nor does it mean that the facts as found by his Honour meant that the statutory test was necessarily satisfied (see Vetter).
45Under the heading that this aspect of the decision was ""unreasonable"" or ""unjust"" the plaintiff restates various inquiries that it is said the first defendant should have undertaken and contends that it was unreasonable for the second defendant not to conclude that subsection 214(1)(c) was established.  The difficulty with the contention is that, other than the reference to any tags on the sheep, I cannot be satisfied that the various steps referred to were suggested to his Honour as ones that should have been taken.  I have already addressed the complaint about not inspecting the tags.
46The challenge to his Honour's failure to be satisfied as to s  214(1)(c) is not made out.
Subsection 214(1)(d):  Exceptional circumstances
47The reasons his Honour gave for not being satisfied as to s  214(1)(d) were as follows:
""Letters were written to the New South Wales Police Force seeking withdrawal of the matter and these are relied upon and form exhibit A on the application.  The fact that the matter was resolved in favour of the defendant does not make the matter an exceptional circumstance.  The defendant has to establish something about the conduct of the proceedings being an exceptionable circumstance, other than some matter mentioned in subs (a), (b) or (c) or s 214(1), to make it just and reasonable for the defendant to have his costs.  In that regard the mere face that the proceedings resolved in his favour was not enough.  There has to be something in relation to the manner in which the proceedings were conducted that has led it to be just and reasonable for the costs order to be made.
The fact that Allan Crawford and Mr Bendall did not make statements is not exceptional, that happens quite regularly.  It was not the position that the prosecution was not in possession of any identification evidence.  When the matter was prepared there was a course of conduct that the prosecutor relied upon by which an inference may have been able to be drawn.  However on the application of the defendant and in the exercise of the court's discretion a large amount of that material was excluded as being too remote.
At the end of the day the prosecution failed at prima facie level due to the concessions made by Peter Smith in cross-examination and that concession was in relation to the distinction between ""those sheep"" to '""some sheep"".  He provided evidence to the prosecution and to the prosecutor of what he deemed to be a continuing chain of identification of the sheep, however this failed.
It is not unknown and in fact it is quite regular for representations to be made to the police to have matters withdrawn.  Mr McGirr on behalf of the defendant made a number of representations for proceedings to be withdrawn.  Mr McGirr has said and this certainly is no criticism of Mr McGirr, that the police - this is a letter dated 14 october, ""It appears to us that the police investigation has been scant and one sided and not carried out with any independent attitude toward our client"".  That was not further expanded upon, nor was there any evidence adduced at any stage or put to any witness to reinforce or enforce that allegation.
There were issues such as trespass which were first raised by Mr  McGirr in his correspondence of 1 September 2010, urging the prosecution to withdraw the proceedings.  There were issues about obligations of landowners and fencing which was raised in that letter as well.  There were issues of damages which were raised in that letter as well.  There was no mention of tagging or identification of sheep raised in that letter.  Subsequent correspondence referred to the subpoena and also in relation to the one-sidedness or scant nature of the investigation.""
48In his written submissions the plaintiff contends that his Honour applied the wrong test in addressing subsection 214(1)(d).  The nature of the error was not identified and none is apparent to me.
49The plaintiff further submitted that in addressing subsection 214(1)(d) his Honour took into account extraneous or irrelevant matters, namely:
""... the evidence of Allan Crawford and Mr Bendall ... in deciding whether the ground in s 214(1)(d) has been made out;  when no statement had been obtained on any admissible evidence called from those persons;
By taking into account that the plaintiff's solicitor did not mention ""tagging or identification of sheep"" in his letter to the police dated 1 September 2010.
By taking into account that the ""prosecution failed"" because of Smith's concession is set out above ... There was never any basis on which Smith could identify the sheep he saw at ""Wyoming"" on 22 December 2009 as the same sheep he saw on 15 December 2009.  He did not inspect them and he was relying on what Crawford had told him on 15  December about where Crawford was returning the sheep.  In fact the prosecution failed because of the complete lack of evidence of the identification of the sheep.""
50The first point has no substance.  In addressing the absence of statements from Mr Crawford and Mr Bendall his Honour was responding to a submission that had been made to him on behalf of the plaintiff which suggested that there was something ""exceptional"" arising by reason of the failure of the police to obtain their statements.
51The absence of reference to tagging in the plaintiff's solicitor's letter was not irrelevant.  In making submission in support of the costs application, I infer that the plaintiff's solicitor had relied upon the letters written prior to the hearing of the proceedings seeking the withdrawal of the charge as a matter which, when taken with other matters, might lead his Honour to conclude that there were exceptional circumstances that warranted an award of professional costs.  Presumably the plaintiff had submitted that in circumstances where the case had failed at a prima facie level and the prosecution had been put on notice of the likely failure that might satisfy subsection 214(1)(d).  I infer that his Honour addressed that submission by addressing the particular points that were raised in the correspondence and comparing them with the grounds upon which the prosecution ultimately failed.  His Honour's analysis does not reveal that he considered anything irrelevant or that he misconstrued s  214(1)(d).
52As to the third point in [49], it was not irrelevant for his Honour to describe why the prosecution had failed in circumstances when that reflected his Honour's earlier reasons for dismissing the charge.
53The challenge to his Honour's failure to be satisfied as to s  214(1)(d) is not made out.
Conclusion
54The plaintiff has not made good any of his challenges to his Honour's reasons for not being satisfied of any of the criteria in s  214(1)(b) to (d) of the Criminal Procedure Act.  Accordingly the challenge to his Honour's refusal to make a costs order fails and the summons must be dismissed.
55The orders of the Court are:
(1)The Summons is dismissed.
(2)The Plaintiff is to pay the First Defendant's costs of the proceedings.
(3)The exhibits be returned.

2708280,Baghdadi v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77,"Judgment
1CAMPBELL JA:  The Court delivered a judgment concerning this matter on 26 October 2011:  Baghdadi v R [2011] NSWCCA 234 (""the 2011 Judgment"").  These reasons for judgment presuppose a familiarity with that decision.  However, to make it quite clear what this judgment decides, I repeat that the version of s 98 Evidence Act 1995 to which it relates is s 98 in the form it had before significant amendments came into effect on 1 January 2009.
2Two days after delivery of the 2011 Judgment, the solicitors for the Appellant made a request that the Court reconsider it.  That request was made under Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules, which states:
""(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order. 
(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered. 
(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered. 
(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3). 
(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.""
3The request for the Court to reconsider its judgment was comfortably within the period within which it is possible to make a request for the setting aside or variation of an order.
4The particular reconsideration that was requested was of Order 5, remitting the matter to the District Court for a new trial.  The basis on which the request for reconsideration was made was that the Court had not considered the second ground of appeal.  Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the result of success on the second ground of appeal would be the acquittal of the Appellant of the two charges.  
5I accept that the Court should have given separate consideration to the second ground of appeal:  Jones v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 409 at 411; AK v Western Australia (2008) 232 CLR 438 at 460.  
6At [108] of the 2011 Judgment I set out the questions arising from ss 98 and 101 Evidence Act that the judge should in substance have asked himself. 
7On posing those questions, I have come to the view that the events of the carjacking and the Berala robbery are not substantially and relevantly similar.  That is because the carjacking involved the theft of a car from its owner in a place readily accessible to the public, while the Berala robbery involved an attempted theft of money from a retail establishment after it had closed for the day.
8There are some substantial similarities between the circumstances in which the carjacking and the Berala robbery occurred.  These are the close temporal connection of the events, the involvement of the distinctive BMW, and the use of a gun (though not necessarily the same gun).  There are also some dissimilarities in circumstances - the carjacking occurred at daytime, while the Berala robbery occurred after dark, there was evidence of a tall man (the Appellant) being involved in the carjacking while there was no such evidence concerning the Berala robbery, and there is no evidence of similarity between the clothing worn by the participants in the two events (apart from, possibly, cargo pants).  
9That there are some substantial similarities between the circumstances of the two events might not be enough to show that ""the circumstances"" in which they occurred are substantially similar.  However, it is not necessary to come to a concluded view about that.  That is because s 98(2) requires two or more events to be both substantially and relevantly similar, and also that the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar before those events are taken to be ""related events"".  Thus, my conclusion about the events of the carjacking and the Berala robbery not being substantially and relevantly similar is enough to show that they are not ""related events"" within the meaning of s 98(2).  
10Consequently, there is no question about s 98 applying to the evidence of the carjacking, so far as the charge concerning the Berala robbery is concerned.  In these circumstances, there is no occasion to consider the questions that would have arisen under s 101, if s 98 were triggered.  
11For the same reason as applies concerning the carjacking and the Berala robbery, the event of the carjacking is not substantially and relevantly similar to the event of the robbery at the Fresh Fruit Palace.  Thus, I conclude that s 98 does not apply concerning the admissibility of the evidence of the carjacking to the charge relating to the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery.  
12The inapplicability of s 98 to the evidence of the carjacking might possibly be a consequence of the deficiencies in drafting of s 98 in the form it had before 1 January 2009.  However, that is not necessarily so.  The sort of circumstance in which s 98 is designed to control the admission of evidence is when someone is accused of doing action A, and the opposite party wants to submit: ""He did actions B, C, D and E, and they are all so similar to action A that it would be a big coincidence if he had not done action A too"".  This is the sort of argument that is most familiarly found concerning crimes that are unusual, or where a distinctive modus operandi has been used.  An argument of that type would not be available in the present case, because the carjacking is not similar to the two thefts. Whatever the explanation for s 98 not applying concerning the evidence of the carjacking, the words of the former s 98 are intractable - it applies only concerning ""related events"", as defined in s 98(2).
13That s 98 does not apply to the evidence of the carjacking, on either charge, does not mean that the evidence is not admissible on each charge.  The evidence fits within the definition of relevance in s 55 because ""if it were accepted, [it] could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding"" for each charge.  It is relevant because it provides a link between the BMW, which it was open to the jury to find was used in both robberies, and the Appellant.  In other words, it is a piece of circumstantial evidence concerning each charge.  It is evidence that could be of preparation (obtaining the getaway car for the robberies) and opportunity (through the possibility of having access to the car after it was stolen). 
14At any trial of these charges a judge may well have had to consider whether, despite its relevance, the evidence should be excluded under ss 135 or 137.  In light of the conclusion to which I have otherwise come, I will not consider those matters. 
15The test by reference to which an appeal court decides whether a verdict was open on the evidence has been stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.  Their Honours said, at 493: 
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.  But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" (citations omitted)
16At 494 their Honours referred to previous cases that had discussed whether the appropriate test for setting aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory is whether there is reasonable doubt in the mind of the court, or whether it is for the court to decide whether there is a doubt that a reasonable jury ought to entertain.  Their Honours said: 
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.  It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.  That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced.  If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence."" (citations omitted)
17That test has been reiterated and held to be applicable in applying the relevant NSW statutory standard laid down by s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912:  MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ, and at [59] per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 [11]-[14] per French CJ Gummow and Kiefel JJ, [80] per Crennan J. 
18In the present case a jury would have no advantage over this court in forming a view about the persuasive force of the evidence concerning the carjacking for the purpose of deciding whether it is shown beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant is guilty of either of the charges. 
19I set out, at [119] and [120] of the 2011 Judgment, the items of evidence that tended in favour of the Appellant being guilty of the two robberies, and other evidence that raised doubts about his guilt.  For convenience I set out most of those paragraphs again here:
""... the Appellant had committed the carjacking, and there was evidence from which a jury could comfortably conclude that the same BMW had been involved in the carjacking and each robbery (notwithstanding the evidence about the yellow car, and Ms Vranic's evidence about the car she saw seeming darkish).  Further, the Appellant's possession of the BMW key after both robberies had occurred is significant evidence against him.  However, as the Appellant was the passenger in the car at the time of the carjacking, rather than the driver, the very act of stealing the car would not itself put the key into his possession.  It is not shown when, between the carjacking and his being picked up by the police, he obtained possession of the key.  Further, Ms Wilmen's evidence of seeing someone, apparently not the Appellant, with the silver BMW on 11 April 2006 has some tendency to weaken any inference that might otherwise be available that the Appellant had had a continuous connection with the car from the time it was stolen until the time the key was recovered from him.  
Against that, evidence other than the carjacking connecting the Appellant with the robberies was far from strong.  There was no evidence of identification of the Appellant by an eyewitness, from CCTV footage, or by forensic testing.  The evidence about the height of the men who actually entered premises to carry out the robberies does not appear consistent with the striking and unusual height of the Appellant.  The description and images of the clothing worn by the robbers at Berala does not match that worn by the Appellant at the time of the carjacking (apart perhaps from cargo pants, which are far from a distinctive item of clothing).  When it was not the Crown case that the same gun had been used in the carjacking as in either of the robberies, evidence about the similarity of appearance of the various guns (itself not particularly precise) becomes considerably less powerful.  ...""
20The evidence of lack of identification of the Appellant to which I referred included the failure of all of the moderately large number of eyewitnesses to the robberies to identify the Appellant in the photographs, the lack of fingerprint evidence and DNA evidence that connected the Appellant with the clothing, and the lack of DNA and fingerprint evidence that connected the Appellant with the silver BMW.  As well, there is another omission or failure of proof in the evidence that would need to be taken into account.  It concerns Ms Wilmen's evidence that the man she saw with the silver BMW on the first occasion on which she saw it was of a height considerably less than that of the Appellant, and was someone who she recalled ""being around the units quite a lot"", and that there was no evidence that linked the Appellant with that block of units.  When the evidence against an accused is not strong, instances in which the Crown has tried and failed to demonstrate a link between the accused and the crime can themselves be relevant, though often of considerably less persuasive force than a positively demonstrated link.  
21On all this evidence, in my view it would not have been open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had committed either robbery.
22Thus, in my view, Order 5 in the 2011 Judgment should be revoked, and replaced with an order that, in lieu of the conviction in the court below, a verdict of acquittal be entered on each charge.
23In the 2011 judgment, the Court also made an Order 6, namely:
""Direct the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions to notify the Registrar of this Court, and my Associate, in writing, promptly after the new trial has concluded.""
24That order was made because the 2011 Judgment was not published on Caselaw while the new trial was pending.  The order aimed to put the Court in possession of information that would enable the 2011 Judgment to be published on Caselaw as soon as the new trial had concluded.  Now that there is not to be a new trial, the purpose of Order 6 has disappeared.  Accordingly, it should be revoked.
Orders
25The orders I propose are:
(1) Set aside Orders 5 and 6 made by the Court in this matter on 26 October 2011.
(2) Enter a verdict of acquittal on each charge.
26RS HULME J:  I agree with Campbell JA.
27HOEBEN J:  I agree with Campbell JA and the orders which he proposes.

2708281,R v Grahovac [2012] NSWDC 299,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Edward Grahovac appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. Because of his early plea of guilty and the associated utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system that that plea of guilty brings, he will receive a sentence of 25% less than it would otherwise have been. The offence of aggravated break, enter and steal carries with it a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. It also carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in deciding the appropriate sentence in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

2Before I get to the particular facts in this case, it is to be noted that the offence of break, enter and steal in the circumstance of aggravation being that he knew that there were people inside, is the particular offence that the offender has pleaded guilty to. I have said in other judgments and I do not need to repeat myself, that many more serious offences are covered by s 112(2) which equally have the standard non-parole period of five years. Nothing that the High Court said in the recent decision of Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 , 244 CLR 120 has affected what I have said earlier about the seriousness of an offence of break, enter and steal and aggravated in the present circumstances, when compared with other offences which carry standard non-parole periods of five years. To make matters clear the particular form of offence committed by this offender is of less seriousness than many other offences under s 112(2) which also carry the standard non-parole period of five years.

3I turn to the circumstances of this offence. The offender was serving a sentence for a similar offence. He was released two days before committing the offence for which he must now be sentenced. He broke into premises in Erskineville knowing that there were people inside. There were four people inside, all asleep, at about 7 o'clock on a Sunday morning. The offender, probably using a screwdriver that he had in his possession, forced his way through the front door. He then entered the bedroom of one of the residents, her boyfriend was staying with her and he chased the offender outside. He was stopped, police were flagged down and he was searched. He was found to have in his possession two computers, a blackberry phone, personal digital assistant and some cash. They had all been taken from the premises.

4Further searching revealed a digital camera and a jewellery bag containing some silver coins and more cash. All of these items had been taken from the premises that the offender had just broken into. He was arrested and taken back to the police station where he has remained in custody ever since.

5As well as the offence for which he must be sentenced, he asked me to take into account an offence of possessing a housebreaking implement. That was a green handled screwdriver found in his possession when he was arrested. Quite why that appears on a form 1, I do not understand. I want to make it quite clear he will not get anything extra because of that matter being on the form 1, it is so closely associated with the substantive offence that it would be quite unfair to increase his sentence because of the matter on the form 1. I encourage the Crown in future not to bother doing the unnecessary.

6The offender has a very dysfunctional background. It is set out in a psychological report, prepared not for this matter but for the earlier matter which saw the offender sent to gaol. It reveals that he received little support from his parents as he grew up. He was mostly free to do whatever he wanted with one qualification that he was belted by his father if his father learnt of any wrongdoing. Domestic violence appears to have been commonplace in the family to the extent that his mother finally left his father when the offender was 13 due to his constant physical abuse of her. Following this he was expelled from school and began to use drugs. He was only 14 years of age when he was convicted of his first criminal offence and by the age of 16 had begun to establish a criminal career.

7He is now 40 years of age and has spent half his life in gaol. His criminal history is lengthy and comprehensive. He is of course by now institutionalised. He told the psychologist who prepared the report for the earlier matter that he was anxious and that these feelings were more severe when he was out of gaol. He clearly has limited ability to conduct himself appropriately whilst out of gaol because of the lengthy time he has spent in gaol. That is a terribly sad circumstance to relate.

8His physical health is not good. He has had his spleen removed as well as his gallbladder and he has been diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependant. A motor vehicle accident left him with significant injuries including the amputation of one of his toes and injuries to his genital area. The earlier report says that he continues to experience pain. There is no suggestion in that report that there is anything likely to change in the future. It is probable therefore that he continues to experience pain as a result of the injuries he received in the motor vehicle accident to this day.

9The circumstances of his release and offending on this occasion are worthy of mention. He was due to get out on parole on 1 November 2011. It was anticipated that that would happen and so arrangements were made for him to go to a methadone clinic shortly upon his release from custody. However, his actual release was delayed by some 12 days and by the time he got to the methadone clinic his admission had been cancelled. I expect that those who run the clinic just formed a view that he was not going to turn up. Of course he was not able to turn up because he was still in custody. In those circumstances he decided to medicate himself and in those circumstances he committed the offence for which he must now be sentenced.

10He is not the sort of person that became addicted to drugs as an adult. Such a person can clearly only have himself or herself to blame if their use of drugs turns into an addiction. Adults know full well the risks that drug use carries with it but the offender was not an adult when he commenced to take drugs. His moral culpability is therefore significantly diminished. It is much less his fault that he has been addicted to drugs and has found that addiction difficult to overcome.

11The ultimate purpose of sentencing is to protect the community. In this case there are three particular areas which I look at in attempting to achieve that objective. The first is general deterrence. These sorts of offences are committed regularly by drug addicts who need to obtain money to satisfy their expensive addictions. The second aspect concerns preventative detention. The offender has been involved in on going regular offending such that there is a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. Within the constraints mentioned by the High Court in both of the decisions (Veen v R (No1) 1979 143 CLR 458, Veen v R (No2) 1988 164 CLR 465 )the need to protect the community through imposing a preventative sentence which carries with it a component of preventative detention is appropriate in this case. 

12But working in exactly the opposite way is the third aspect of protecting the community which I take into account and that is the need to rehabilitate the offender. It is doing nothing to protect the community to release the offender without substantial lengthy and ongoing support. Without that I am confident that the offender would simply re-offend quickly as he did on this occasion and harm further members of the community and see himself back in gaol soon after release. 

13Many people have spoken about the way in which the various ways in which judges seek to protect the community and work in opposite directions. General deterrence and preventative detention work one way but rehabilitation in this case works the other. The offender does need close, indeed extremely close support upon his release. He needs, prior to his release on parole, experience in the community through programs such as work release. He needs, whilst in custody, intensive drug rehabilitation programs such as the Ngara Nura program, a program I understand that he has been accepted into.

14Without corrective services spending more time with this offender than most others in the criminal justice system, I can guarantee the community will be further harmed. Because of the offender's need for rehabilitation there is obviously a need for an extended period of supervision on parole. The further matter justifying the finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour is that this sentence is virtually wholly cumulative on the sentence the offender was serving when he was released from custody in November last year.

15Ultimately, however, a lengthy sentence must be imposed upon the offender. His offence was serious, involving entry into the bedroom of one of the victims of the offence. It comes as the culmination of a long period of similar criminal activity and the offender needs to be made aware, as much as anyone else, that his conduct simply cannot continue to be tolerated. 

16Some comparison was made in the course of submissions both from Mr Cruikshank and the Crown with the sentence imposed upon the offender, on an earlier occasion, for an offence which is said to be more serious. That is not the right approach to be taken to sentencing an offender. A judge does not look at earlier sentences imposed upon a particular person and decide whether the offence with which the judge is dealing is more or less serious and go up and down using other sentences imposed upon that person as a starting point. I will not do what I was implicitly invited to do in this case.

17The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years to date from 13 November 2011 and a head sentence of seven years. The offender will thus be eligible to be released to parole on 12 November 2015.

		22 November 2013",2012-05-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708282,Duncan v R [2012] NSWCCA 78,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: In the early hours of the morning, on 7 October 2009, there was an horrific motor vehicle accident when a car driven by the applicant left the road at high speed while taking a bend on Duffie Drive, near Cessnock. The applicant survived, with relatively minor injuries. Of the other five young people in the car, two were killed and three others suffered serious injury.

2In respect of the two deaths, the applicant was charged with manslaughter under s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In respect of the three injured passengers, she was charged with dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, in circumstances of aggravation, namely driving at a speed which exceeded the applicable speed limit by more than 45 kilometres per hour. 

3The applicant pleaded guilty to each offence and appeared before North DCJ for sentence on 11 February 2011. She was taken into custody, bail refused, at the termination of the hearing; judgment was delivered a week later on 18 February 2011.

4On each of the three counts of dangerous driving, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment, the first term commencing on 11 February 2011. Each of the subsequent sentences was accumulated by a period of six months on the previous sentence.

5In respect of the two offences of manslaughter, the applicant was sentenced on each to a non-parole period of five years imprisonment with a further term of fours years and six months, giving a total sentence on each count of nine years six months. The first such term was accumulated on the third sentence for dangerous driving by a period of 12 months. The effect of that accumulation, together with the accumulations of six months on each of the earlier counts, resulted in a period of two years imprisonment attributable solely to the three counts of dangerous driving. The second manslaughter sentence was also accumulated by a period of 12 months on the first. Accordingly, it commenced three years after the commencement of custody, on 11 February 2014. The total period of mandatory custody, prior to eligibility for parole was thus eight years. The effective balance of term was the additional four years six months in respect of the second manslaughter sentence, giving a total period of 12 years six months imprisonment. An automatic disqualification from holding a driver's licence for a period of three years operated and was not extended.

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences on three grounds, namely:
(1) failing to give effect to findings of contrition and remorse;
(2) failing to take account of 'extra-curial punishment', and
(3) imposing a manifestly excessive sentence.

7For the reasons given below, there should be a grant of leave to appeal, but the appeal must be dismissed.

Background to offences
8A detailed statement of facts was tendered at the hearing on sentence. Included with the tendered material was a signed statement of the applicant dated 22 December 2009. In it she asserted that the accident was caused by a mob of kangaroo on the side of the road, one of which she swerved to avoid. Much of the statement was untruthful.

9The motor vehicle involved in the accident was owned by the applicant but was unregistered and uninsured. The vehicle was a silver-coloured Mitsubishi Verada sedan with a large pink sticker along the top of the rear window reading ""Crazy"". The car had a sports exhaust which made a distinctive, loud noise.

10Of the six persons in the car at the time of the accident, the oldest was the applicant, being 36 years of age. The only other adult was Jake Wyborn who was 21 years of age. There appears to have been a party at the applicant's home on the evening before the accident. He lived at Aberdare and, on the evening in question, was collected by the applicant in her car in order to assist in dealing with some angry teenagers. Other residents in the area called the police, two of whom attended at the applicant's house, including Senior Constable Heymans, who was later to attend at the scene of the accident.

11Although the applicant and others had been drinking during the evening, the evidence of the clinical forensic pharmacologist who analysed the blood sample taken from the applicant, was unable to conclude that her capacity to drive would have been impaired by the drugs detected.

12According to the statement of facts, at about 3am Mr Wyborn realised that he had left his mobile telephone and wallet at his home and the applicant proposed that they go and get them. The statement continued (par 24):

""The offender and Jake Wyborn went out to the offender's car. Although Jake Wyborn's driving licence had been previously suspended, he got into the driver's seat. The offender was heard by [KD] to comment to Jake Wyborn about the fact that he did not have a licence. Notwithstanding, the offender took the front passenger seat.""

13Four young persons also got into the car, two, KD, who was the applicant's step-daughter, and BP, a friend of one of the applicant's children, were both aged 16. The others were younger. Cassandra Ford was aged 15. She had left her parents' home three months earlier following a family conflict, the applicant having taken her into her home and offered her a room, assuring her parents that she (the applicant) would look after their daughter: statement, par 10. She was killed in the crash.

14The youngest person in the car was Jayde Duncan, aged 13 years, a nephew of the applicant by marriage. He had been dropped at the applicant's home on the previous evening and had intended to stay the night. He was killed in the crash. Why any of the young people were in the car in the early hours of the morning is unclear. No explanation was given by the applicant at any stage.

15The story of the events of the fateful drive were set out in the statement of facts in the following passages:

""26. During the drive to his Aberdare home, Jake Wyborn was driving at high speeds. On the stretch of road after turning onto rural Duffie Drive, Mr Wyborn accelerated. The offender commented on his driving, taunting him, 'You can't get to two hundred', and, 'You ain't got no balls [...] you won't get there'. Mr Wyborn responded, 'You watch'.

27. Sitting in the back seat, [BP] could see the car's speedometer, and saw that the needle moved just past the indicator for 200 kilometres per hour, to about 205 kilometres per hour.

28. As the car approached the Aberdare town ship, and before it reached the bend at which the fatal crash was soon to occur, Mr Wyborn slowed down. He arrived at his house, and went to get his things. Being unable to gain access to the house, which had been locked up for the night by his parents, who were asleep, Mr Wyborn returned to the car.

29. The offender, who had moved into the driver's seat, suggested that he return to her house and stay for the remainder of the night. Jake Wyborn then got into the front passenger seat. The offender drove off, heading in a northerly direction out of the town and back onto Duffie Drive.

30. Duffie Drive is in a rural area, and carries a single lane for traffic travelling in each direction, being northbound and southbound. The edge of the road is bitumen, which gives way to dirt, vegetation, and then bushland. The speed limit for the relevant section of Duffie Drive is 100 kilometres per hour.

31. At this time, the weather was fine and the road way was dry, there having been no rain. It was fully dark, with the sunrise not due until 6.24am in the vicinity of Duffie Drive.

32. The offender was driving at a very fast pace. [BP] heard her tell Jake Wyborn, 'I'm gunna beat your speed', or something similar. He watched the speedometer from the rear seat as the indicator needle moved past 195 on the dial, and advanced towards the marker for 210 kilometres per hour.

33. The car was moving so fast as it entered Duffie Drive, [KD] took hold of a handle above a rear passenger door to steady herself. She was frightened. [BP] also reached up to the handle and grabbed it. Like [BP], [KD] could see the vehicle's speedometer from where she sat in the back seat. She looked at the dash as the car sped along the roadway, and saw that the speedometer was showing a speed of 190 or 195 kilometres per hour, with the needle continuing to climb. The offender told those in the car to be quiet so that she could concentrate. [KD] noticed a look of concentration on the offender's face as the speed of the vehicle increased.

34. As the car approached a sweeping left hand bend on Duffie Drive, [BP] realised that the offender would not be able to negotiate the curve in the road at the speed at which she was travelling. He called out to her to slow down, and to stop. He heard others in the car call similar warnings.

35. Seconds later the car entered the bend at high speed. At the time, there were no other cars on the road, and no other objects or animals in the area. Neither [BP] nor [KD] saw kangaroos in the vicinity, and kangaroos are not known to frequent the area.

36. [BP] observed that the offender did not reduce speed or apply the car's brakes as she approached and entered the bend. On entering the curve, the offender could not negotiate the curve and the vehicle left the roadway at high speed. It initially passed over onto the wrong side of the road, leaving the single carriageway on the eastern side of the road. The vehicle travelled some 40 to 50 metres into the adjacent bushland, where it was involved in a series of impacts with a number of trees, causing the sedan to shear in half. The occupants of the rear seat were ejected. Both Jake Wyborn and the offender, in the front of the vehicle, remained in their seats and were able to extract themselves from the wreckage.""

Ground 1: finding - remorse
16The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge in which she acknowledged the truth of the factual accounts set out in the statement, the fact that she faced a lengthy gaol sentence and her belief that she deserved severe punishment. She read a prepared statement to the Court addressed to the Court and to the families and friends of the persons who died or were injured in the crash. She sought to express ""the amount of remorse and sorrow that I am feeling for all of you"" and her ""sincere condolences and apologies to all those lives who have been affected by my driving"". She was not cross-examined.

17After setting out in full the short statement the applicant had read to the Court, his Honour stated that he was ""prepared to accept that the offender is now truly remorseful"", with emphasis on the present tense, noting that she had in the statement sent to the police on 4 January 2010 attempted to minimise her role in the accident. The sentencing judge also acknowledged that it must have been ""very difficult to immediately acknowledge the stark nature of her true criminality"". He concluded, at pp 25-26:

""Therefore, although it has taken sometime for her to fully accept the enormity of her conduct she has clearly faced up to this by the way in which she gave her evidence and also by the fact that she was willing to plead guilty to two counts of manslaughter, as well as three counts of aggravated driving causing grievous bodily harm.""

18After recounting the background, the trial judge noted, at p 29:

""In this matter the offender was quite close to each of the victims. From her evidence before me and the statement she read out to Court ... I accept that she has a real sense of self-inflicted shame and guilt and this is probably exacerbated by her previous relationship with each of the young people in the car. I note that the facts here reveal gross moral culpability on behalf of the offender and therefore I am unable to attach too much weight to considerations of self punishment.""

19The sentencing judge then referred to a passage in a judgment of this Court, which he attributed to Regina v Dhanhoa [2000] NSWCCA 257 but which was in fact extracted from the judgment of Smart AJ (Wood CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing) in Regina v Koosmen [2004] NSWCCA 359; 42 MVR 123 at [32]. The sentencing judge cited the last sentence, but it is convenient to set out the whole of the paragraph:

""Dhanhoa is authority for the proposition that the effect of the death in the accident on the offender and self punishment (the self inflicted sense of shame and guilt) were often highly relevant factors, that the weight to be given to these depended on the circumstances and that different judges may give different weight to those factors. Where the facts reveal gross moral culpability judges should be wary of attaching too much weight to considerations of self-punishment. Genuine remorse and self punishment do not compensate for or balance out gross moral culpability.""

20The sentencing judge then noted that counsel had not submitted that treatment received since the accident amounted to ""extra-curial punishment"" but that such treatment, including publications on the internet and in the local newspapers, had helped to demonstrate to the applicant how serious the matters were. His Honour continued:

""I do accept that she is now genuinely remorseful. Her counsel said that the Court should humanise, rather than demonise her, for the way that she reacted at first and for some time following the accident. The Crown did not oppose this and having heard her give evidence I do accept that she is now genuinely remorseful.""

21His Honour further found that she was unlikely to re-offend and had excellent prospects of rehabilitation. He also recognised the difficulty which would be caused by her separation from her children whilst in custody. He stated that he had had regard to general and specific deterrence: p 30.

22The precise nature of the complaint in respect of how the sentencing judge dealt with the question of remorse was somewhat obscure. In written submissions, counsel for the applicant stated that the sentencing judge had ""failed to bring these findings into account in the sentencing exercise"": paragraph 3.4. However, as the submissions acknowledged, giving little weight to such elements in a case involving the consequences identified above, properly characterised as one of ""gross moral culpability"" was consistent with the principle stated in Koosmen. That statement was, in effect, challenged as being inconsistent with the principle acknowledged by the High Court in Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55; 149 CLR 305 at 315 that ""[c]ontrition, repentance and remorse after the offence are mitigating factors, leading in a proper place to some, perhaps considerable, reduction of the normal sentence"". Three responses are available in respect of this submission. 

23First, the statement relied upon by the applicant was not that of the High Court but of one member of the Court, Murphy J. It was stated in broad terms and was not echoed by other members of the Court. Secondly, the offence in question was not one of gross moral culpability. Mr Neal was the Chairman of the Yarrabah Council. The victim of the offence was a white store manager living on the reserve. The offence was a common assault, involving spitting at the store manager. Comments made by a judge as to the significance of an apology to the store manager and his wife have no direct application in the present circumstances. Thirdly, the suggestion that this was a statement of general application is contradicted by the important qualification that it should ""in a proper case"" lead to a reduction in sentence. There is no inconsistency between those remarks and the approach adopted by this Court in relation to motor vehicle accidents causing death in Dhanhoa and Koosmen.

24Comments are required in respect of the submissions in support of ground 1. First, remorse and contrition, at least in so far as they affected the applicant's legal responsibility, were delayed. That led to a lengthy investigation before charges were laid. In effect, the police were required to reconstruct the circumstances of the crash in order to demonstrate that her first statement, made three months after the crash, with the assistance of solicitors, was untruthful. 

25Secondly, it would have been almost inconceivable that a person of normal sensibility would not have felt remorse and contrition immediately and in a high degree. Absence of such a response would depend upon the person persuading herself of her own lies or having such gross insensitivity as to be, in effect, mentally unhinged. That was clearly not the case of the applicant in either respect.

26Thirdly, her role as the instigator of the high speed driving, not only by herself but by Mr Wyborn, her responsibility as an adult in charge of two children and two other young people, together with the blind stupidity of the driving itself, fully warrant the label of gross moral culpability. There were other incidental elements which supported that conclusion, including the fact that she knew the car was unregistered and uninsured, that Mr Wyborn had no driving licence and that others in the car had pleaded with her to slow down.

27Fourthly, there was a tendency in the submissions put on behalf of the applicant to gloss over the fact that her statement of remorse was belated. The first evidence of remorse appears to have been her pleas and acceptance of the statement of facts. There was no evidence to suggest that the applicant had previously attempted any form of apology or statement of remorse to the injured survivors or to the families of those who had died or been seriously injured. Her evidence gave no assistance in that regard.

Ground 2: extra-curial punishment
28The concept of extra-curial punishment as a mitigating factor in respect of a serious offence has been discussed in a number of decisions in this Court including, most recently, Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [85]-[97]. The cases appear to distinguish what may truly be described as extra-curial punishment which, as the sentencing judge noted, was not a concept relied upon in the present case by counsel for the applicant, and public humiliation and vilification, which the Court has held may be relevant, at least where it reaches such proportion as to have a physical or psychological effect on the offender: Kenny v R [2010] NSWCCA 6 at [49] (Howie J), discussed in a somewhat different context from the present in Einfeld at [98]-[101].

29This was not a case in which the applicant suffered public humiliation or vilification as a person having a high profile in the community, but rather because of the enormity of her conduct and the fact that it had a wide impact within a small community. The fact of such a public response is less important for itself, rather than for its effect on the applicant. The sentencing judge took account of the psychologist's report prepared by Dr Katie Seidler, a clinical and forensic psychologist. Dr Seidler noted that she had symptoms of depressed mood, but also noted that she had been on an anti-depressant drug since mid-adolescence: paragraphs 44 and 45. She reported having attempted to take her life on four occasions, two preceding the crash and two thereafter. There were no symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder: paragraph 47. The applicant was described as ""tearful and upset in describing how she does not believe she will cope in prison and how she is scared of being the victim of assault in custody"": paragraph 49. Reference was made in the same passage to her degree of upset at being separated from her children. Although noting that the applicant was suffering from ""considerable emotional distress and psychological disturbance across almost all domains of functioning"" there was no clear identification of a psychological disorder of a moderate to severe kind, or of one which could readily be traced to the crash itself.

30It is also important, if significant weight were to be given to the public humiliation of the applicant, that the response of the community be understood in context. The sentencing judge accepted that, over the 14 months since the accident, she had been subjected to ""vitriolic attacks, verbally and on Facebook and a wealth of adverse material in print, on radio and TV"": p 25. So much may be accepted, although the content of the material is not before this Court. To evaluate the attacks and her response, content and context would be important. For example, little weight might be given to such material if it were a response to her own unwillingness to accept full moral and legal responsibility for her conduct, as appears to have been the case, at least in her dealings with the police, for several months after the crash. As neither content nor context are known to this Court, no further analysis is possible.

31The personal circumstances of the applicant were considered in detail by the sentencing judge. There could be no complaint that they were not taken into account, as their careful recitation demonstrates that they were. There is no demonstration of any specific error on the part of the sentencing judge in this regard.

Ground 3: manifestly excessive sentence
32Ultimately, the gravamen of the applicant's challenge to her ""sentence"" was based on the suggestion of manifest excess. The written submissions referred on a number of occasions to ""the sentence imposed"" or words to that effect suggesting that it was not the individual sentences which were challenged, but the degree of accumulation, by reference to the principle of totality. Reference was made, for example, to a ""total sentence"" of 12 years and six months which, after allowance for a 25% discount for the plea of guilty, meant that ""the notional starting point is close to 17 years"" and that the notional starting point for the total non-parole period was close to 11 years: submissions, par 6.3. However, that approach is misconceived: either there is a challenge to the length of the individual sentences or to the degree of accumulation.

33In R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 this Court, constituted by Spigelman CJ, Mason P, Barr, Bell and McClellan JJ, concluded that in a typical case of an offence under s 52A(1) and (3), ""[w]here the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than ... two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate"": at [229]. The offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm under s 52A(3) carried a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The offence with which the applicant was charged, being aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 52A(4), carries a maximum penalty of 11 years. As the Court noted in Whyte, an appropriate increment is required to reflect the higher penalty in respect of the aggravated version of the offence: at [231].

34The sentencing judge, correctly, made reference to the guideline judgment and the need for an appropriate increment: reasons at p 20. There can be no criticism of the three year fixed term sentences imposed in respect of each offence under s 52A.

35Senior counsel for the applicant did, however, challenge the severity of the sentences for the two manslaughter charges. In fixing the sentences, the judge referred to the decision of this Court in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 52 MVR 528. That case involved three vehicles racing in traffic along the Great Western Highway at St Marys. The car driven by Mr Borkowski collided with another vehicle, killing both occupants. The offender was charged with manslaughter and sentenced to a minimum period of mandatory custody of six years with a balance of term of three years. In respect of one offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of four years was imposed, the sentence in respect of the other death involving a similar non-parole period with a balance of term of three years; the second sentence commenced two years into the fixed term of the first sentence. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence.

36For reasons which are not presently relevant, the appeal was dismissed. However, in considering the adequacy of the sentences, Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) stated:

""[65] Each of the sentences imposed upon the respondent was itself manifestly inadequate. A sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for the offence of manslaughter relating to either one of the two victims reveals that the Judge's assessment of the criminality of the respondent must have fallen well short of what it should have been. The inadequacy of the sentences was compounded by an accumulation between the two sentences of only 2 years.

[66] The very least sentence that could have been imposed upon the respondent was, in my opinion, a total sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. Had I been the sentencing judge, I would have imposed a greater sentence.""

37There are two factors which were operating in Borkowski which do not arise in the present case. First, although the Court declined to interfere on this basis, it did hold that the late guilty plea entitled the offender to a discount of no more than 15%, rather than the 25% allowed: at [36]. While not a basis for intervention, that factor may have affected the finding as to an appropriate sentence. Secondly, Howie J noted that the case was ""more serious than other motor manslaughter cases to which the Court's attention was taken because it involved three vehicles all being driven dangerously in a joint enterprise and, hence, the potential dangerousness to others in the vicinity was increased dramatically from a case involving the dangerous driving of a single vehicle"": at [59]. His Honour suggested that in the case of a single vehicle, more appropriate assistance might be found in the judgment of R v Cameron [2005] NSWCCA 359; 157 A Crim R 70. Accordingly, it is appropriate to have regard to the latter case. 

38Mr Cameron was 21 years of age at the time of his offence. Sometime after the collision his blood alcohol reading was 0.114mgs per 100mls: at [13]. He lost control of the vehicle at a speed ""considerably in excess of 100kph, in a 50kph speed zone within a town area: at [8]. Three of the four passengers were killed in a destructive collision with a power pole. On each of the three counts of manslaughter, the offender was sentenced to a non-parole period of two years with an additional term of fours years imprisonment. Each of the second and third sentences was accumulated by 12 months on the previous one. A fixed three year term in respect of an offence under s 52A was wholly concurrent with the minimum terms in respect of the second and third manslaughter counts: at [4]. The minimum term of mandatory custody was thus four years with a balance of a further four years. The offender was disqualified from holding a driving licence for 10 years. In resentencing, this Court imposed, in respect of each count of manslaughter, a non-parole period of four years with a balance of term of three years. The scheme of accumulation was maintained, giving a minimum custodial period of six years. Hislop J agreed with Grove J; McClellan CJ at CL also agreed with Grove J, but expressed the view that the sentences imposed were ""at the lowest end of the available range"" and that ""a significantly greater sentence may have been appropriate"", were it not a prosecution appeal: at [3].

39The appropriate range for a particular offence will depend upon the circumstances of the offending and of the offender. It will also take account of such guideposts as the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, if any. Further guidance is obtainable from sentences imposed by other courts for similar offending. Taking all those considerations into account, it is not possible to say that the sentences imposed by North DCJ in the present case were outside the relevant range. This ground of challenge must be rejected.

40To the extent that the ground sought to challenge the overall minimum period of mandatory custody, in a case where the respective sentences were themselves beyond challenge, the applicant sought to invoke the principle of totality. That principle has particular significance in respect of multiple offences resulting from a single incident or course of conduct, in circumstances where the sentences are imposed consecutively or are partly accumulated one on another. 

41In this case it was appropriate that there should be a degree of accumulation, a view with which counsel for the applicant did not cavil. Nor could it be said that the period of two years imprisonment, solely referable to the three dangerous driving offences, was inappropriate. Further, the accumulation of the second manslaughter sentence on one year of the first offence did not, of itself, suggest any inappropriate accumulation.

42The total period of mandatory custody imposed in respect of all five offences was 19 years, of which the applicant is required to serve eight years. That is undoubtedly a lengthy sentence, but the degree of accumulation is moderate and the resulting aggregate sentence is not demonstrably outside the proper range of what is just and appropriate in respect of the gross moral culpability of the applicant.

43In fairness to counsel, it may be noted that little weight was placed on the submission that there was an inappropriate degree of accumulation.

Conclusion
44Each of the proposed grounds of appeal must be rejected. Taken individually, there might be a real issue as to whether this was a case in which a grant of leave to appeal would be appropriate. The sentencing judge provided a carefully reasoned judgment, containing a comprehensive analysis of the matters which needed to be considered in imposing sentence. No fault having been identified in his analysis, despite the careful attention of two senior counsel (different counsel being responsible for the written submissions and the oral argument), it might be thought that leave to appeal should be refused. On the other hand, the seriousness of the offending and the need to consider five significant separate sentences, provide a basis for such a grant.

45In all the circumstances, there should be a grant of leave to appeal, but the appeal should be dismissed.

46BLANCH J: I agree with Basten JA.

47HALL J: I respectfully agree with Basten JA and the order proposed by his Honour.

2708289,R v Coffey [2012] NSWDC 282,"sentence

1This is the sentence of Leo Coffey. Starting in late December 1995 Leo Coffey has been before the Local Court on twenty-three occasions for breach of an AVO or offences of physical violence. On three of those occasions police officers appear to have been his victim. On nineteen occasions it is likely his partner was the victim. 

2The facts and circumstances are all too familiar. Coffey has a long history of abusing alcohol and cannabis. He drinks and smokes daily, usually until he blacks out. 

3On 21 April 2011, he and his partner were both drinking heavily. He began to argue with her; he cannot even remember what started it. His predisposition to generalised violence is exacerbated when he is intoxicated. His violence in the early hours of 22 April 2011 was unremitting and brutal. He does not remember assaulting his partner Annette. When aroused by police later that morning, he saw the bedroom walls and floor were blood splattered. He remembers thinking ""I hope I haven't done something stupid."" 

4Not only was his conduct stupid, it was seriously criminal. Today he is to be held accountable for recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Annette. 

5As sentencing judge it falls to me to determine a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court, committed by this offender, harming this victim in the community of Brewarrina, see Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender; that is called subjective matters. The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his fact finding task, it simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered that a court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it. 

6Before any sentence that can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to general deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether the offence attracts a standard non parole period and if so the length of the parole period, and finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment to be imposed. None of those can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.

AGREED FACTS

7The victim Annette was aged thirty-eight years at the material time. She was involved in a personal relationship with the offender; he was then forty-six years of age. He lived at Bathurst Street, Brewarrina. She lived both at that house, at his house and at her sister's home in Cato Street, Brewarrina. 

8On the afternoon of Thursday 21 April 2011 she was at the Bathurst Street residence, as was the offender, John Scott a brother of the victim, Marie Murphy a sister of the offender and Wayne Gordon AKA McHughes. Some alcoholic drinks were taken by the offender, the complainant and other adults. At about 6.30pm all five left the house for a hotel in Brewarrina. Upon arrival at the hotel Coffey began to argue with the complainant. His grief was that she had ""slept with"" her nephews. Scott stayed at the hotel for a short time and then left alone. After about ten minutes at the hotel the offender and complainant returned to the Bathurst Street house. She was affected by alcohol at that point saying later that she was ""pretty drunk"". 

9After they went inside he maintained his complaint about her nephews. She was fully clothed. He punched her in the face and kicked her. When they were in a bedroom she noted blood coming from her face. He gave her ""a good hit to (her) head"". She lost consciousness and ultimately woke up in the bedroom ""in a pile of blood"". About 1am Wayne McHughes, who also lived in the house, heard her call ""help me"". He got out of bed and went to the door of the room occupied by Coffey and the complainant. McHughes knocked on the door. He said, ""Stop hitting her."" He heard the offender say, ""Yeah I'll stop hitting her."" Someone in the room turned on some music. I am satisfied it was not the complainant. McHughes said, ""Stop it or you'll get locked up by the coppers."" McHughes went back to bed; he did not see the complainant. 

10Marie Murphy, who was sleeping with McHughes, also heard the complainant call for help. Murphy stated that she and McHughes went to the door of the room containing the offender and complainant four times. Murphy pushed on the bedroom door but was unable to open it. She could see through a slight opening that a mattress was pushed against the door. When the complainant woke she noticed the clothing on the lower part of her body had been removed. She went to the toilet. About 5am it was still dark. The offender's sister, Mayanne Coffey came to the front door of the house. She spoke to the complainant and told her to ""Go straight to the police."" 

11I pause here to say how impressed I am at Aboriginal women who know that the remedy for violence to them and to their sisters is intervention by the police. The certainty of detection is the best deterrence for domestic violence.

12I continue with the agreed facts. The complainant spoke to Marie Murphy, who noticed that the complainant was injured and told her to go to the hospital. The complainant left the house, walked to the police station. There she pressed the emergency alert to summon a police officer. She sat down to wait. William Trapman walked by the station between 5.30am and 6am. He saw her. She was, to him, obviously significantly injured. She complained that she had been kicked and said, ""He jumped all over me."" She identified her assailant. 

13Trapman waited with her until Constable Schofield arrived at the police station, some time after 5.30am. He saw her sitting on the step of the police station. He saw she was suffering a serious laceration to her right temple near the eye. Her right eye was swollen, the right side of her face badly swollen. She was whimpering and crying; an ambulance was summoned. Constable Schofield took three photographs. They have been exhibited before me.

14The ambulance officers took her to the hospital where she was examined by Dr Hameed at about 11am. He recorded the complainant suffered the following:




a four centimetre deep laceration involving the superficial and deep skin in the lateral angle of the right eye. This laceration was about half a centimetre wide;



a black eye on the right eye, her eyeball was undamaged and vision intact;



minor abrasions on both upper eyelids and at the root of the nose;



minor contusions in the left upper chest, right arm, upper abdomen and both shoulder blades;



fractures in the right sixth, seventh and twelfth ribs; and



fractures of the left sixth and tenth ribs. The latter fractures were revealed by x-ray examination.

15Further photographs were taken at the hospital. They show that the left eye has redness close to the iris and bruising on the upper zygoma from the nose through to the outer aspect of that cheekbone. 

16At 6.30am police attended the Bathurst Street residence. They went to the bedroom occupied by the offender and complainant. There were bloodstains on two walls of the room and on two mattresses in the room. The offender was present. He ""smelt strongly of alcohol and appeared to be intoxicated"". There were, what appeared to be blood stains on his hands. He declined, as was his right, to be interviewed.

17Dr Dalgetty, a female, made an intimate examination of the complainant later in the afternoon. She recorded the complainant suffering from the following:




bilateral periorbital bruising with the right eye closed by swelling and a left subconjunctival haemorrhage;



bruising and swelling to the upper lip and gum;



four areas of bruising, approximately three by four centimetres around the jaw;



a full thickness laceration to the right temporal area, bruising and swelling over the dorsum of both hands;



on the upper arms and shoulders, ten bruises, the longest of which was eight by ten centimetres and which had a central abrasion;



on the anterior chest an area of bruising, fifteen centimetres by ten centimetres;



over the umbilicus an area of bruising eight centimetres by eight centimetres with overlying abrasions;



three abrasions over the legs posteriorly - that is the back of the legs;



a red raised semi circular area on the right side of the mons pubis;



redness and swelling to the clitoral and periurethral area and to the left labia - that is around the vagina area;



extreme tenderness at the introitus; that also is around the genital area.

18Dr Dalgetty opined that the facial laceration would leave permanent scarring. See the attached photograph which I have before me. 

19Dr R A North, a medical practitioner and formally a general surgeon with more than fifty years post graduation medical experience, was engaged by the prosecution to offer an opinion about the magnitude of the injuries suffered by the complainant. After considering all of the material Dr North opined that:

""Her rib injuries evidence severe trauma having been inflicted. As the victim is thirty-nine years of age and her rib density and strength would still be that of a young person, quite severe force would be required to cause fracture...I consider severe trauma to have been inflicted causing a deep facial laceration and fracture of five ribs. This would require considerable force such as that sustained in a motor vehicle accident.""
 
That is, to spend a night with her boyfriend was as damaging to her as a motor vehicle accident. 

20The offender has been in custody on this matter only since he was arrested on 21 April 2011. The offender was committed for trial on the present count on 15 August. The case was listed for trial on 12 December 2011, however the offender was arraigned before Acting Judge Lerve on 9 December 2011 when he entered a plea of guilty.

OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY

21From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences, an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the case before the Court with criminality of offences of a similar kind, including a notional worse case, bearing in mind the maximum penalty. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.

22Any assault of the kind I am dealing with here constitutes what is called a trespass against the person, that is an injury committed with violence. All persons have a right to the physical integrity of their person and body. This trespass or wrongdoing was physical violence of a disinhibited and sustained kind. On four occasions during its occurrence McHughes and his partner went to the door of the bedroom where the merciless beating was ongoing. The offender was told to stop. I am satisfied he understood and said he would stop hitting her, but turned the radio up or the music up so that the music would drown out his continued assault upon her. 

23Annette was drunk. In the bedroom she was hit in the face and became unconscious, whether as a result of a blow or a combination of the blow and the affects of alcohol I am unable to say. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she lost consciousness shortly after calling for help. During her period of unconsciousness the offender must have continued to strike her, although for how long I am unable to say.

24I note there are injuries to her ribs, no doubt caused by blows of some kind from the offender. There is evidence before me, agreed evidence, that he kicked her. He could not on one kick have broken all of those ribs there must have been repeated kicking. The complainant must have been unconscious at that time, because she makes no complaint as to how these rib injuries occurred. 

25The clothing on the lower part of her body was removed and further injuries sustained to her genital area. She has no idea how those injuries occurred. Those injuries must have been not only painful, but deeply humiliating for her after the event, and deeply worrying for her after the event. 

26I have reviewed the injury tally. It is extensive, by which I mean at many sites over her body. Frequently grievous bodily is confined to one or two sites this is not this case. From head to torso and stomach and the back of the legs, the arms and the vaginal area were all substantially injured.

27The level of recklessness was high. That is to say this was not a case where there could have been any possibility the victim was consenting to any of this brutal conduct.

28Notwithstanding his level of intoxication he must have turned his mind to the real likelihood that the injuries being occasioned by him as he continuously physically pummelled the complainant, torso and head would, if he continued amount to really serious injuries to her, but even so he persevered with his aggressive and hostile conduct towards her. That constitutes a high level of recklessness.

29This violence occurred in a domestic setting in circumstances where she had every right to look to him for care and protection. That situation adds to his criminality. That this offence was against a woman, who, as nature would have it, was less powerful than he, marks this offence as a significant abuse of his physical power over her.

VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT

30I have received a Victim Impact Statement. The material contained in the Victim Impact Statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that any opinions may be expressed in it I recognise they are not the opinions of an expert.

31The Victim Impact Statement coming as it does from the primary victim may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their affect upon her. 

32The function of statements such as this one is firstly to give victims an opportunity of being heard in the sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of the offender. 

33Secondly, it enables sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender.

34Thirdly, the Victim Impact Statement contributes to an offender at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining some insight into the impact his offending conduct has had upon his victim.

35Finally, of course, Victim Impact Statements, as they are read by judges in sentencing proceedings remind judges of the impact crimes such as this one have upon the ordinary men and women who are the victims of that crime.

36Annette says this:

""Since being assaulted by Leo Coffey I have not been able to sleep properly as every time I close my eyes I see him (I think it might be) poking me.

I have nightmares about it. My head"" - I think it might be - ""aches regularly. I regularly get headaches which my ribs ache regularly. I regularly get headaches which I have to treat with Panadols. Since then"" - that is since the assault - ""I drink alcohol a lot more, because that's the only way I can a sleep. 

If and when Leo Coffey gets released from gaol I don't want him back in Brewarrina as I am frightened he will come back and get me.""

So here is a woman well after the assault living in fear of the offender.

SUBJECTIVE MATTERS - PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, BACKGROUND, RELATIONSHIP AND FAMILY

37Leo Coffey was born forty-seven years ago in Brewarrina. He was one of nine children, four of whom have now passed. His parents are also deceased.

38He is an Aborigine who has lost contact with his tribal identity and apparently regards Brewarrina as his country. Some of his sisters are still resident there.

39He was raised in a children's home from the age of three or four, although I note he told Dr Christopher Bench he began in that home when he was seven. He went there with three of his seven sister. He and they were sexually abused. The sexual abuse for him may well be underreported, but he says it was incident confined to genital folding by a seventeen or eighteen year old. The physical abuse on that score seems much more serious. It involved being hit with implements, such as a switch, meaning a thin piece of branch, wire, strap, jug cord, throughout his time in foster care.

40Since 1986 Coffey, then aged twenty-one, has had four significant relationships with female Aboriginal partners. I say Aboriginal, because I think they all were. There was no physical violence in the first relationship, but it was a feature of the three others. The first two relationships survived for five years each. The more recent two relationships have been much shorter, two years and another for six months respectively.

41He is the father of six children, coming from the first three relationships. Their ages range from twenty-three years to two years. 

42Anna Robilliard, a clinical psychologist retained by the defence, noted ""He did not appear to have any significant emotional attachments or sense of parental responsibility for his children.""

43It would appear his only source of familiar support upon release may be one or more of his sisters.

EDUCATION, SKILLS, EMPLOYMENT

44Coffey attended primary and high school in Brewarrina. He left school in Year 7. 

45He obtained employment at the Brewarrina Meat Works for a short period. Did some farming work and occasional seasonal work on the cotton paddocks. 

46However, he has been largely unemployed for most of his adult life. He notes that he has spent a fair portion of his life since 1988 in prison.

47Whilst in custody he has done a number of courses, including a current course in Aboriginal Arts.

GENERAL HEALTH

48Ms Robilliard described Coffey as ""stocky"". My sense of him, based only on court appearances, is that he is overweight. He has early signs of diabetes and requires daily monitoring of sugar levels. He has chronic renal impairment, a condition that claimed his mother. It is likely this condition is alcohol related, as was his mother's. There is scarring on his arm or arms from past self-harm. He suffers from hepatitis B. 

MENTAL HEALTH

49He was first diagnosed with depression in 1993 after the break up with his first partner.

50He has engaged in self-harm in the past and it would seem in the present. There has been at least one past attempt at suicide by hanging. His current practice of self-harm is head butting against a wall.

51Testing by Anna Robilliard indicated severe depression. 

52Importantly, it is Dr Bench's opinion, also retained by the defence, that his current medication regime for depression is sub-therapeutic. Dr Bench urged his anti-depression medication dosages be reviewed. Dr Bench opined he met the diagnosis of schizophrenia and has done so for the past five or six years.

53Regrettably in the community he is not medication compliant, but he does find it easier to comply in custody. 

54Dr Bench said he also meets the diagnosis of polysubstance abuse.

55I shall review his drug and alcohol history shortly.

56Although not a mental health issue, testing by Ms Robilliard achieved an IQ score of seventy-eight putting Coffey in the below average range with a percentile rank of seven.

57As to his personality profile Ms Robilliard observed:

""...[Coffey]...appears to have a well entrenched and generalised violent disposition... [his] violent interpersonal behaviour is exacerbated when he is intoxicated and this has been a long time and well entrenched feature of his behaviour.""

58In respect of the interaction of these last two features, together with gross alcohol consumption, she makes a general observation from research and studies, suggesting

""That low IQ mitigates against effective problem solving and increases the likelihood of consequent interpersonal misunderstanding making these individuals more vulnerable to the negative consequences of alcohol. While IQ cannot be altered controlling the use of alcohol maximises the individual's cognitive capacity for rational thinking and behavioural control.""

59Dr Bench reported the offender denies experiencing any psychotic symptoms around the time of his offending. Dr Bench opined

""No direct conclusions can be drawn as to any links between his mental health and offending behaviours.""

60Dr Bench did note, however, that:

""As a consequence of intoxication Coffey's judgment would be grossly impaired, he would have lacked all impulse control - or ability to reason as to the seriousness and consequence of his actions.""

61It will be seen that as a consequence of the guilty plea and my view of the level of recklessness, earlier stated, I have rejected the doctor's opinion that the offender ""lacked all ability to reason as to the seriousness and consequence of his actions."" I accept, as does the charge, he may have some level of impairment to his capacity to reason.

DRUGS, ALCOHOL AND OTHER FORMS OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES 

62Coffey reported a significant gambling problem of longstanding. He will put up to $300 through the poker machines in a day. He is usually able to maintain his rent but falls behind on other bills. The $300 a figure must be measured against his income stream of less than $400 weekly. 

63However the gambling problem pales against his alcohol and drug abuse issues. He started drinking at the age of sixteen. He told Dr Bench he consumed approximately one carton of beer daily which would be supplemented by wine and spirits. In another portion of his interview he told Dr Bench he drank three to four cartons of beer daily and smoked three to four sticks of cannabis daily. One of those might be incorrect, but on either view his drinking is substantial. On the day of the offence he claimed to have drunk in the vicinity of three to four casks of wine (nine to twelve litres). He told Ms Robilliard that he drank and smoked every day until he blacks out. By any measure then, his drinking is a major problem.

64Coffey reports being a heavy abuser of cannabis. He told Ms Robilliard he had never attended rehabilitation. However he told Dr Bench he had engaged in two rehabilitation programs, both in Brewarrina, which may well be the Orana Haven I think. Be that as it may, both professionals recommend further rehabilitation. 

CHARACTER AND CRIMINAL ANTECEDENTS

65I have noted Ms Robilliard's observation as to Coffey's predisposition to violent behaviour. The most striking emerging from his criminal antecedents is the preponderance of offences of the physical violence I mentioned at the outset, among which I have included breaches of AVOs.

66This offence shows a greater intensity of violence and injury than any other before it. This offence is the third occasion the offender has been dealt at first instance by the District Court. In 2000 he was before this Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2005 for a detain with intent offence. This offender has been sentenced to custodial terms for his violent conduct on eight prior occasions. There have been a further four occasions where he has received terms of suspended imprisonment.

REHABILITATION PROSPECTS

67There are a number of factors suggesting rehabilitation will be difficult to extremely difficult to achieve in this case, namely:




An entrenched history of domestic violence since late 1995(?).



An entrenched history of alcohol and drug abuse in the community, which exacerbates mental health issues.



Modest intellectual capacity resulting in modest to ineffective problem-solving skills, a situation exacerbated when consuming large quantities of drugs and alcohol. 



Past failures to comply with depression medication and present medication inadequacy.



Poor work ethic and general absence of vocational skills.



Familiar support limited to two sisters whose attitude to supporting the offender is unclear. Note for example his sister's recommendation to the complainant to go straight to the police. In those circumstances I can't be satisfied she wants anything to do with him.

68I note Coffey's chances may be improved if he were to commit to the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program based at the Parklea Correctional Centre, and then on release, to the Probation and Parole twenty week Domestic Abuse Program. 

69Further, his chances of rehabilitation would improve if, as a condition of his parole, he was required to attend Roy Thorne Rehabilitation Centre, or some other culturally sensitive centre, for a period of six months or so to address drug and alcohol issues and ensure a gradual transition into community living. 

70Yet further rehabilitation may be achieved should his alcohol and drug consumption be closely monitored upon his release into the community by random testing with appropriate parole sanctions in the event of illicit drug use.

71Finally he should be subject to mental health reviews during the parole period to ensure cooperation with community based mental health teams and medication compliance in respect of anti-psychotic and anti-depression medication requirements.

CONTRITION AND GUILTY PLEA

72The guilty plea was entered on 9 December 2011, that is, three days before the trial was set down, I think it was on a Friday. Thus the complainant was not required for court, although she, no doubt, was on notice until the plea was entered. Nor was any jury required for this trial and it was possible by the availability of phone recording for potential jurors to inform themselves whether their attendance was or was not required. In those circumstances there was utilitarian value in the plea. 

73The offender's contrition was addressed by Ms Robilliard in these terms. The offender:

""maintained he felt sorry for injuring Anita...his paucity of emotional language made it difficult for him to express his feelings other than to state he felt 'no good'. He also said he felt 'down for doing this'.""

74It was Ms Robilliard's opinion that the offender ""appeared appropriately remorseful, although his emphasis was on the consequences for himself rather than the victim"". 

75A discount for the utilitarian value of the plea and the offender's contrition, such that it is, shall be one of 17.5 per cent. 

CUSTODY

76As earlier stated, Coffey was arrested on the day following the offence. He has been bail refused since 22 April. His sentence will be backdated to that time.

77I have noted elsewhere the courses done by him whilst in custody, suggesting cooperation with authorities and seeking to use his time in custody usefully through self-improvement.

DETERRENCE

78Domestic violence is rampant within the Aboriginal communities. At first flush such a fact may suggest general deterrence would be effective and useful. In principle (D) in Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, Wood J recognised: 

""an absence of any real body of evidence demonstrating that the imposition of imprisonment provides any effective deterrent in either discouraging abuse of alcohol by members of the Aboriginal society, or their resort to violence when heavily affected by it.""


79There is now a body of research seriously challenging the effectiveness of general deterrence in the broader criminal community. See (Marginal) General Deterrence Does not Work and what it means for Sentencing, Mirko Bagaric and Theodore Alexander (2011) 35 Crim Law 269 and authorities there-in cited. 

80Justice Wood appears to observe that principle (D) that notwithstanding the absence of such evidence: 

""A belief cannot be allowed to go about that serious violence by drunken persons within the Aboriginal community will be treated by the courts as occurrences of little moment."" 

81Those comments made in respect of the ineffectiveness of general deterrence may equally apply to the question of changing or forming such a belief. Even so I think a sentence of full time incarceration, as will happen in this case, ensures that this offender and others would not come to a view that domestic violence when drunk is ""an occurrence of little moment"".

SETTING THE SENTENCE

82The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years. It has a standard non-parole period of four years for an offence falling in the mid range of seriousness. Bearing in mind the objective criminality as I have described it and the subjective circumstances as I have found them to be, but for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of four and a half years imprisonment. That is to be discounted by 17.5 per cent which amounts on my calculations to nine and a half months. The effect of that discount then is to reduce the penalty I would have imposed from one of four and a half years to one of three years, seven and one half months. 

83This is a case in which special circumstances should be found. My finding is predicated upon my recommendations to the Parole Board set out under the heading of Rehabilitation Prospects, and in particular, one suggesting at least six months in full time rehabilitation and twenty weeks of the Probation and Parole Domestic Abuse program.

84Leo James Coffey, you are convicted that you on or about 21 April 2011 at Brewarrina in the State of New South Wales did recklessly cause grievous bodily harm to Anita, whose last name is known to you. For that offence you are sentenced to a non-parole period of two years to date from 22 April 2011 and to expire on 21 April next year. The balance of term will be one year seven months, which on my calculation will expire on 6 December 2014.

85Mr Coffey, can I tell you this, that in the normal course of events, if I set a sentence of three years or less I can order your release to parole. When I set a sentence, as I have here, that is more than three years, namely three years and seven months, even though I have fixed a non-parole period of two years, I cannot order you released to parole. You must satisfy the Parole Board that you are eligible for parole. Do you understand me so far?

86OFFENDER: Sort of, sir.

87HIS HONOUR: Right. Your earliest release date is on 21 April next year. Do you understand that much?

88OFFENDER: Yeah.

89HIS HONOUR: All right. I cannot release you, you have to persuade the State Parole authority to release you. Do you know who they are?

90OFFENDER: Yeah.

91HIS HONOUR: All right. So they will be the people who will make a decision to release you. There are two things they are interested in Mr Coffey. The first is, will you be a danger to yourself? What will inform their decision as to whether you will be a danger to yourself, in your case, is the likelihood of resuming alcohol consumption, or the likelihood of resuming drug consumption. Right?

92OFFENDER: Yeah.

93HIS HONOUR: The second that they are concerned about is, will you be a danger to somebody else? What is likely to inform their decision about that is the likelihood of you resuming alcohol, the likelihood of you resuming drugs, and whether you have done anything while you were in custody to address domestic violence abuse. Your best bet to persuade them that you should be eligible for release - that is, that you would not be a danger to someone such as your partner - is to do the domestic violence programs that I have made reference to in my remarks on sentence.

94OFFENDER: Yeah.

95HIS HONOUR: To do something about drugs and alcohol and attending drugs and alcohol programs while you are in custody. All right?

96OFFENDER: Yeah.

97HIS HONOUR: I just tell you that if they do not release you on the first time you go before them you will have to wait another twelve months, another year, before they will review your case. So it is important that you get yourself ready to persuade them that you are eligible for release and to get yourself ready by 21 April next year. Okay?

98OFFENDER: Yeah, I feel certain.

99HIS HONOUR: No doubt your solicitor might talk to you later when I am finished. 

100Is there any other matter Madam Crown?

101BARNES: No your Honour.

102HIS HONOUR: Mr Styles?

103STYLES: No your Honour.

104HIS HONOUR: That completes the sentencing and you may return to custody. Any other matter?

105BARNES: Your Honour I was asked to provide two clean copies of the defence reports.

106HIS HONOUR: In what matter?

107BARNES: In this matter.

108STYLES: In the matter of Coffey. I don't know the reason, but--

109HIS HONOUR: I can tell you the reason. The reason was I used the ones I had as working copies and then when I finished using them, because I was reading them I began to mark them, forgetting that they were marked as exhibits.

110STYLES: Of course your Honour, those are the copies, there's no objection to those going with the Court papers.

111HIS HONOUR: Thank you, I've got them from both sources, but that's all right.

		15 April 2013",2012-05-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708292,Markou v R [2012] NSWCCA 64,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  The appellant was charged with the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mathew Cunneen Wyllie (the ""complainant"") whilst in company, contrary to s 35(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, and in the alternative with assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the complainant whilst in company, contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act.  The appellant elected to be tried by a judge alone, pursuant to ss 132 - 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
2Upon arraignment before Finnane DCJ, the appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded.  By a judgment dated 7 April 2011 his Honour found the appellant not guilty of the first charge but guilty of the alternative charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in company. 
3On 22 July 2011 his Honour sentenced the appellant to nine months imprisonment to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order commencing on 29 July 2011 and concluding on 28 April 2012.  The appellant served about four months of his sentence before being granted bail by Schmidt J on 6 December 2011.
4The charges against the appellant arose out of an incident that occurred in the early hours of Sunday 9 August 2009 at a nightclub in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst.  The appellant, who was then aged 24, was present with a group of friends to celebrate a 21st birthday.  The complainant, who was then aged 19, was also present at the nightclub with a group of friends to celebrate a 21st birthday.  The appellant and the complainant were not known to each other.  A scuffle occurred, as a result of which the appellant punched the complainant.  The appellant made a formal admission for the purposes of his trial that he assaulted the complainant ""by punching him to the left side of the jaw in the lounge bar area"" of the nightclub.  
5The trial judge made the following observations concerning what appeared on CCTV footage of the incident:
""The accused then comes into view accompanied by another man.  He came into view with this man, he advances towards the complainant with this man and I am of the opinion that at all relevant times he was accompanied by this man who I think was a man called Lillas.  Again, he was identified as such by the accused.  Had the accused not said who he was I would not have known who he was.
The complainant is shown on the CCTV footage as standing there with his hands out on each side of his body pointing to the ground at about forty-five degrees.  His left appears to be partly covering the body of his friend who appears to be a little shorter than him but that could be wrong because it could be some error obtained by the way in which [the] camera is situated.  All I can say is that appears to be the position.  The accused is then seen on the film.  He advances towards the complainant and strikes at him.  He has admitted striking on the left of the jaw.  The admission was made in writing on the advice of counsel"" (Judgment p 3).
6The trial judge said later in his judgment that the complainant could be seen on the film ""to reel back after he was hit by the accused, to put his left hand up and then to come round the corner and at the same time that he came round the corner, he was then pursued by someone who attacked him by throwing a punch aimed at his head"" (Judgment p 5).  It is clear from the film that it was not the appellant who committed the second assault.  
7As a result of one or both of these assaults the left side of the complainant's lip was lacerated, one tooth was lost, one tooth became loose and the complainant's jaw was broken.  Whilst the trial judge found that the complainant suffered grievous bodily harm, he was unable to attribute the infliction of that harm to the punch thrown by the appellant rather than that thrown by the second assailant.
8His Honour accordingly found the appellant not guilty of the first charge, which involved the infliction of grievous bodily harm.  He concluded however for the purposes of the alternative count that the punch delivered by the appellant did cause the complainant ""some actual bodily harm"" (Judgment p 18).  
9The trial judge concluded as follows in relation to the ""in company"" element of the offences with which the appellant was charged:
""In my opinion there is evidence that at relevant times he was accompanied by persons. They may not have been known to the Crown but certainly they were known to the accused, and one of them was a person he nominated.  At the time he struck at the complainant he was accompanied by that person"" (Judgment pp 17 - 18).
10In light of these conclusions the trial judge found the appellant guilty, whilst ""in the company of unknown persons"", of assaulting the complainant, thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm (Judgment p 19; s 59(2) of the Crimes Act). 
11In considering sentence, the trial judge expressed the view that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""significant"" even though it had not been proved that the appellant had caused the complainant's grievous bodily harm.  His Honour went on to say:
""I can be sure of the fact that he did strike him either on the jaw or near the jaw and he struck him sufficiently hard enough for Mr Wyllie to turn and disappear.  He did it deliberately.  He has advanced no reason for doing it.  It was not done to defend himself.  He was not at the time under any attack and I think the conduct itself is serious"" (Judgment dated 20 May 2011, p 2).
12His Honour noted that the appellant had previous convictions which indicated ""that he was engaged in deliberate violent conduct on a number of earlier occasions"" (ibid p 2) and that the appellant is a ""very large"", ""very powerfully built"" man (ibid p 2).  
13The trial judge considered that the seriousness of the offence could not be adequately dealt with by giving the appellant a recognizance or imposing a fine (ibid p 3).  He considered that a sentence of imprisonment was warranted (Remarks on Sentence dated 22 July 2011, p 1).  Having received a report assessing the suitability of the appellant for an Intensive Correction Order, the trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment of nine months to be served by way of such an order.
14I now turn to consider the appellant's grounds of appeal in relation to his conviction and sentence:
GROUND 1:  ""THE TRIAL JUDGE'S VERDICT OF 'GUILTY' OF ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM IN COMPANY WAS CONTRARY TO LAW BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A FINDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANDATED REQUIREMENTS OF S 133(2) OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT 1986 (NSW).  THEREFORE THERE HAS BEEN A WRONG DECISION ON A QUESTION OF LAW WITHIN THE MEANING OF S 6(1) OF THE CRIMINAL APPEAL ACT 1912 (NSW)""
ADDITIONAL GROUND 1:  ""THE TRIAL JUDGE'S VERDICT OF 'GUILTY' AND CONVICTION FOR ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM IN COMPANY WAS UNREASONABLE WITHIN THE MEANING OF S 6(1) OF THE CRIMINAL APPEAL ACT 1912 (NSW) BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL BODILY HARM OCCASIONED TO THE VICTIM""
15The appellant submitted that the trial judge did not comply with the requirement applicable in a judge-alone trial that the Court's judgment ""include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied"" (s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act).  The appellant relied upon the following observations of the High Court in Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 concerning an earlier statutory provision relevantly in the same terms as s 133(2):
""[28] ... while s 33(2), when specifying that which a 'judgment' must include, does not use the expression 'reasons for judgment', it should not be taken as intending that the requirements of s 33(2) be satisfied merely by a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact that the judge has made. Rather, there must be exposed the reasoning process linking them and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict that is reached"" (see also AK v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438).
16The appellant argued that the trial judge erroneously failed to identify what in law amounts to ""actual bodily harm"" and the evidence justifying his conclusion that the appellant inflicted such harm upon the complainant.  The appellant argued that there was in fact no evidence capable of justifying his Honour's conclusion.
17The expression ""actual bodily harm"" is not defined in the Crimes Act.  The generally accepted judicial explanation of the meaning of the expression ""bodily harm"" is that given in R v Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498:
""... we think that 'bodily harm' has its ordinary meaning and includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor.  Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling"" (at 509); see also for example Overall v R (1993) 71 A Crim R 170 at 178 and R v Tamcelik, ex parte Ozcan [1998] 1 Qd R 330 at 332.
18A judge sitting alone may derive some assistance from reference to this statement.  However as Donovan itself confirmed, ""bodily harm"" (and hence I consider ""actual bodily harm"") ""has its ordinary meaning"".  A judge does not in my view breach the requirements of s 133 by failing to refer to judicial expositions of such an expression which is used in the relevant statute with its ordinary English meaning.  
19A judge sitting alone is not required to ""express all of the matters which necessarily have to be stated to a jury unfamiliar with even the basic principles of the law"" (R v Winner (1995) 79 A Crim R 528 at 531).  There are natural ""differences between the instruction which would be expected of a judge to a jury and the elaboration of reasons for the judge's own decision"" (ibid at 531).  Kirby ACJ said in R v Winner that he was ""far from convinced that the absence from such reasons of express references to judicial instruction which might be required for a jury trial will necessarily ... authorise the intervention of a Court of Criminal Appeal.  One of the obvious advantages intended by Parliament in the procedure of trial before a judge sitting alone is the saving of time, the consideration of the case by a trained and experienced decision-maker and the provision of reasons for the decision which may be reviewed on appeal"" (ibid at 531).  
20In these circumstances I do not consider that the trial judge infringed s 133(2) by not elaborating upon the meaning of the ordinary English expression ""actual bodily harm"".
21Further, contrary to the appellant's submissions, there was in my opinion evidence that supported the trial judge's conclusion that the appellant's blow caused the complainant some actual bodily harm.  Understandably, his Honour could not conclude that the serious injuries suffered by the complainant were caused by the first assault (by the appellant) rather than by the second assault (by the unknown assailant).  However, the inference that the complainant suffered some not insignificant physical harm as a result of the appellant's assault can be drawn from a number of matters.  
22First, the appellant admitted assaulting the complainant by punching him on the left side of the jaw.  Secondly, it is apparent from the CCTV footage that the punch was swung with significant vigour by a man who is undoubtedly large and well-built.  Although it is possible that the punch was to some extent deflected by the complainant's arm, the appellant's admission indicates that it did land.  Thirdly, it is apparent from the CCTV footage that the force of the blow was sufficient to send the complainant reeling or staggering back.  His Honour's finding to this effect accorded with what is apparent on the film.  Fourthly, the result of the punch, also evident on the film, was that the complainant immediately brought his left hand up to his face in a manner suggesting he had been hit there.
23These matters are in my view sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant suffered some actual bodily harm as a result of the first assault, at least by way of the bruising which would inevitably flow from the receipt of a forceful blow to the face.  There can be no doubt that the complainant suffered an injury that resulted in significant interference with his comfort (see the passage from Donovan quoted in [18] above; Cramer v R [1998] WASCA 300 and compare Smejlis v Matthews [2004] WASCA 158 at [54] - [55]).
GROUND 1:  [AS ABOVE] INSOFAR AS IT RELATES TO THE ""IN COMPANY"" ELEMENT OF THE OFFENCE 
ADDITIONAL GROUND 2:  ""THE TRIAL JUDGE'S VERDICT OF GUILTY AND CONVICTION FOR ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM IN COMPANY WAS UNREASONABLE WITHIN THE MEANING OF S 6(1) OF THE CRIMINAL APPEAL ACT 1912 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE ASSAULT WAS COMMITTED IN COMPANY AS REQUIRED BY S 59(2) OF THE CRIMES ACT 1900 (NSW)""
24The meaning of the expression ""in company"" was explained as follows by von Doussa J in the context of a charge of assault with intent to rob:
""The true meaning of the provision emerges from the authorities just cited.  A person commits a robbery, or an assault with intent, in company where that person participates in the robbery or assault together with another or others in the sense that the victim is confronted by the combined force or strength of two or more persons or that the forces of two or more persons are deployed against the victim.  It is not necessary that more than one participant actually strike or rob the victim; it is sufficient that the accused and one or more other participants be physically present for the common purpose of robbing, or assaulting with intent, and of physically participating if required"" (R v Brougham (1986) 43 SASR 187 at 191).
25After referring to Brougham and other cases, Kirby J in R v Button [2002] NSWCCA 159; 54 NSWLR 455 summarised the law in this area as follows:
""[120] What emerges from these cases? A number of propositions can be stated: 
First, the statutory definition (s 61J(2)(c)) requires that the offender be 'in the company of another person or persons'. Secondly, the accused and such person, or persons, must share a common purpose (either to rob, or as here, sexually assault). Thirdly, the cases appear to assume that each participant is physically present. Fourthly, participation in the common purpose without being physically present (for example, as a look-out or as an accessory before the fact) is not enough. Fifthly, the perspective of the victim (being confronted by the combined force or strength or two or more persons) is relevant, although not determinative. If two or more persons are present, and share the same purpose, they will be 'in company', even if the victim was unaware of the other person.""
26It is apparent from these statements that the accused and the person or persons with whom the accused is alleged to have been in company must have shared a relevant common purpose.  In this case the Crown needed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant and the man whom the judge referred to as 'Lillas' and whom he concluded was ""in company"" with the appellant shared a common purpose that embraced the assault of the complainant.  
27His Honour referred to the appellant advancing towards the complainant and being ""at all relevant times ... accompanied"" by Lillas (see [5] and [9] above) but his Honour did not expressly refer to the need for the Crown to prove that those persons had a common purpose.  His Honour may have had this requirement in mind, however the words used in his judgment suggest a view on his part that it was sufficient for the Crown to establish that the persons were present together and appeared to be seeking the same end, namely, to assault some or all of the persons in the group of which the complainant formed part.  
28In my view however, persons are not acting ""in company"", with a common purpose, unless there is some express or implied arrangement or understanding between them to act together to achieve an agreed end.  Proof of a nod or even a look acknowledging that they will act together may suffice, but a mere coincidence of purpose not resulting from an arrangement or understanding will not be enough.  As observed by McPherson J in Adsteam Building Industries Pty Ltd & Anor v The Queensland Cement and Lime Co Ltd & Ors [1985] 1 Qd R 127; (1984) 14 ACLR 456 in a civil context ""I cannot see that it is possible for persons to 'act in concert' towards an end or object, or even simply to act in concert, unless there is at least an understanding between them as to their common purpose or object ... A mere coincidence of separate acts is insufficient"" (at 459).  His Honour's remarks are, in my view, equally applicable to the criminal concept of acting ""in company"".  For persons to act ""in company"" there must at least be an understanding between them as to their common purpose or object.
29The trial judge's judgment does not recognise that a finding of common purpose was necessary to justify a conclusion that the appellant acted ""in company"" with others when he assaulted the complainant.  Whilst the judgment contains, as required by s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, ""the principles of law applied by the Judge"", it reveals that the trial judge did not apply the correct principles.
30The further question raised by these grounds of appeal is whether there was any evidence that could have supported a finding that the appellant and the person by whom he was accompanied had a requisite common purpose, permitting the conclusion that the appellant acted ""in company"".
31There was no evidence of any relevant express communication between the appellant and Lillas.  The only possible evidence that they shared a common purpose was their conduct in the moments before the appellant assaulted the complainant.
32The trial judge referred to the CCTV film as showing that the appellant ""advances towards the complainant with [Lillas]"" (see [5] above).  This accords with my observation of the film.  The appellant and Lillas step towards the complainant and others standing near him.  The appellant hit the complainant and Lillas appeared to hit a man next to him.  However the advance together amounts to no more than about two or three steps.  
33This material is not, in my view, sufficient to permit the inference that there was a relevant arrangement or understanding between the appellant and Lillas.  It is true that, from the complainant's point of view, he was being ""confronted by the combined force or strength of two of more persons"" (see the passage from Brougham quoted in [24] above) but that is not sufficient.  If the psychological impact on the victim of the presence of more than one individual was the only relevant factor in determining whether an offence was committed ""in company"", an innocent bystander could be put at risk of involvement in an offence (see Western Australia v Maria Mona Dick [2006] WASC 81; 161 A Crim R 271 per Johnson J at [18]).  Rather, the critical element is the existence of an arrangement or understanding between the accused and another (or others) to act in a certain way.
34In the present case, the appellant and Lillas may have independently decided, on the spur of the moment, to approach and assault those in the complainant's group.  The film of the moment in which they both appeared to advance to do that did not in my view establish beyond reasonable doubt that they implicitly agreed or had an understanding between themselves to do so.  
35In these circumstances I would uphold Additional Ground 2 as there was no evidence upon the basis of which the trial judge could have found that the appellant acted ""in company"" with another person or persons.  The appellant's conviction of an offence under s 59(2) should therefore be quashed.  However unless the appellant succeeds on one of the further grounds of appeal with which I have yet to deal, he should be convicted of an offence under s 59(1) as this replicates the offence created by sub-section (2) save for the ""in company"" element. 
36I note in conclusion in relation to these grounds of appeal that counsel for the appellant did not contend at the trial that the ""in company"" element of the offence had not been established.  Nevertheless leave to raise the point on appeal (see r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules) should in my view be granted as it concerns an essential element of the offence of which the appellant was convicted and my conclusion on this point indicates that there was a miscarriage of justice so far as that conviction was concerned (see R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; 125 A Crim R 505 at [63]; Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51; 86 ALJR 145 at [3]).
GROUND 2:  ""THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN LAW BY FAILING TO CONSIDER THE DEFENCE OF SELF-DEFENCE WITHIN THE MEANING OF S 418 OF THE CRIMES ACT 1900 (NSW) ('THE ACT')""
37This also was an issue that the appellant's counsel did not raise at the trial.  On appeal the appellant contended that the omission was not significant as ""the defence cannot effectively disclaim a defence open to the accused upon the evidence"" (Pemble v R [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 at 133).  The Crown responded by relying upon the decision of this Court in R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 holding that the principle in Pemble does not apply to judge-alone trials.  In turn the appellant responded by submitting that Ion was incorrect and should not be followed.
38This possible application of Pemble in the present case need not be resolved as, for reasons given below, there was not in my view any evidence that provided a proper foundation for a defence of self-defence.  Counsel for the appellant therefore had good reason for not raising the defence at the trial.  In these circumstances, leave to raise this ground of appeal should be refused.
39Section 418 of the Crimes Act provides for a defence of self-defence when two conditions are satisfied.  First, the accused must have believed the conduct to be necessary (so far as is relevant to this case) ""to defend himself or herself or another person"".  Secondly, the accused's conduct must have been ""a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceive[d] them"".  The first condition is concerned with the subjective state of mind of the accused and the second condition concerns the objective reasonableness of the conduct.
40The appellant gave evidence in chief that he saw two people confronting his friend Blake Colombo and that he ""walked around the back of Blake, because he is only a little guy, for his protection"" (Transcript p 274).  He said that Mr Colombo was head-butted and then ""everybody jumped in.  There was a lot of pushing and shoving"" (ibid).  He went on to say:
""I remember people getting pulled out, people that were in the fight getting pulled out, by who I am not sure.  And I remember I took two or three steps and I jabbed out with my right hand ... I have taken two or three steps forward and jabbed out with my right hand [hitting the complainant] ... I knew Blake was behind me.  I knew he was with the other group.  I was more or less protecting my friends ... it wasn't a punch that had any intent to it, it was more or less a 'back off' kind of, 'get away from my friends' (Transcript pp 274 - 6). 
41The appellant also gave the following evidence in cross-examination:
""Q. At the time you approached Mr Wyllie, there was no threat coming from Mr Wyllie or Mr Coleman, was there?A. To my opinion, yes, there was.
Q. What was that threat?A. Mr Wyllie I knew was involved and I knew Mr Coleman was involved.  I didn't know what they were going to do next.  Mr Wyllie, I remember, was looking straight at me and I, my first instinct was, I wanted to protect my friend Blake who was behind me.
Q. Mr Wyllie was standing with his hands by his side, wasn't he?A. Yes.
Q. He was standing in a type of posture suggesting 'there is no threat here', 'there is no drama here'?A. In my opinion or my recollection, no he wasn't.
Q. How do you describe the stance that he was projecting?A. It was more a - how do you describe it?  A stance - he had his hands to his side but he was certainly looking straight at me and it was more of a, you know, kind of a--
Q. What?  'Come and hit'?A. Kind of, yeah.  That's what I would describe it.
Q. Standing there in a 'come and hit me' kind of stance?A. He was looking straight at me, so he certainly didn't appear to me as if he was scared or he was cowering away or anything like that.  It was straight up, looking straight at me.
Q. What, daring you to hit him?A. I wouldn't say daring me to hit him but he certainly wasn't running away"" (Transcript pp 293 - 294).
...
""Q. His hands were out extended as you have indicated, palms facing you in the gesture not of defiance or aggression but of submission or non-aggression?A. Well no, being there it certainly wasn't submission.  He would have been more aggressive or more aggressive than submission if you like, to put it that way.
Q. You agreed before I think with the suggestion that he was virtually saying [well come] and hit me or that was the impression you got?A. That was the impression I got when I was there, yes"" (Transcript p 307, 30 March 2011).
...
""Q. And you told us just then the extent you paid attention to Mr Wyllie on this night.  Tell us about this aggressive look that he was portraying to you, what made this look aggressive?A. Given the fact that I originally knew he was involved because he was one of the people that walked up and confronted Blake Colombo, so I knew he was in the fight in a sense there and when he got pulled back I remember him looking at me like that so as to say come on.  It certainly wasn't a don't come near me look.  It was more of a what have you got kind of look"" (Transcript p 309).
...
""Q. You were the peace maker protecting your friend, weren't you?A. I was protecting my friend, yes"" (Transcript p 312).
42None of this material constituted evidence of an imminent threat of physical harm to Mr Colombo or to the appellant which the appellant asserted justified immediate action on his part to defend himself or Mr Colombo by hitting the complainant.  Certainly the appellant regarded the complainant's attitude as defiant but the appellant did not say that he thought that the complainant was about to hit him or Mr Colombo and that the appellant therefore needed to get his punch in first.  Accordingly, there was no evidence that the first, subjective element of self-defence was satisfied.  In any event, the second, objective element of a proportionate response to a perceived threat was also plainly not satisfied.
GROUND 3:  ""THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN LAW BY MISDIRECTING HIMSELF ON THE STANDARD OF PROOF CONCERNING THE ELEMENT OF ACTUAL BODILY HARM IN THE OFFENCE OF ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM IN COMPANY""
43This ground relates to a statement made by the trial judge near the end of his judgment that the actual bodily harm that he found the appellant to have caused ""together with the harm caused by the man around the corner [in the second assault] is probably what caused the complainant to be in the state that he is currently in"" (Judgment p 18, 7 April 2011).  The appellant submits that this statement indicated that his Honour did not regard it as necessary for him to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant caused actual bodily harm to the complainant.
44I make the following observations in response to that submission.
45First, the trial judge's conclusion was an understatement.  It was clear, not merely ""probable"", that one or other, or both, of the two assaults caused the complainant's injuries.  No other conclusion was available on the evidence.
46Secondly, the statement did not represent a step in the trial judge's reasoning that led to his conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the relevant offence.  It was merely a supplementary remark about the totality of the injuries suffered by the complainant.  Once his Honour had concluded, in the absence of proof of grievous bodily harm, that the appellant had at least caused the complainant some actual bodily harm, it was not strictly relevant for his Honour to express a view as to how the totality of the injuries was occasioned.  However his Honour apparently did so for the sake of completeness.
47Thirdly, there is nothing in the passage relied upon to suggest that when considering whether the elements of the relevant offence were established, the trial judge considered that the Crown was not bound to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.  Indeed at two points not much earlier in his judgment, his Honour specifically stated that the Crown had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt (Judgment pp 16 and 17).
48This ground of appeal should accordingly be rejected.
CONCLUSION ON CONVICTION APPEAL
49The remaining grounds of appeal relate to the sentence that his Honour imposed.  As the appellant has succeeded in respect of Additional Ground 2 of his appeal, his conviction of an offence under s 59(2) of the Crimes Act should be quashed.  However as that is the only ground upon which he succeeds, he should, for the reasons that I have given above (see [32]), be convicted of an offence under s 59(1) of the Crimes Act in exercise of the power conferred on this Court by s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act (see Spies v R [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603).
50It is accordingly necessary to re-sentence the appellant.  However before doing so I should deal with the appellant's grounds 4, 5 and 6 as they may be relevant to the re-sentencing (I shall continue to refer to the appellant as such notwithstanding that in respect of his sentence he needs leave to appeal).  It is unnecessary to deal with Ground 7 (contending that the sentence is manifestly excessive) as the impugned sentence is nullified as a result of the appellant's conviction being quashed.  
GROUND 4:  ""THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED BY FINDING THAT 'AT NO POINT HAS HE EXPLAINED IN ANY SATISFACTORY WAY WHY HE STRUCK AT THE VICTIM' AND 'IT IS HARD TO KNOW PRECISELY WHY HE HIT HIM ...' AND 'CAUSING HIM SOME HARM FOR NO APPARENT REASON ... '""
51The appellant submitted that these remarks of the sentencing judge indicated that he had not considered the appellant's evidence ""as to why he struck the victim"".
52I consider that the sentencing judge was well justified in making the remarks that he did.  The appellant's description of the circumstances leading to his assault of the complainant did not in my view satisfactorily explain his behaviour.  Certainly he asserted in general terms that he was defending his friend but the evidence that he gave did not reveal why he thought it necessary to punch the complainant when he did (see [40] above).
GROUND 5:  ""THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED BY NOT IDENTIFYING WITH PARTICULARITY THE EXTENT OF THE ACTUAL BODILY HARM INFLICTED BY THE APPLICANT UPON THE VICTIM""
53The evidence did not in my view enable his Honour to identify with any particularity the extent of the actual bodily harm inflicted by the appellant upon the complainant.  His Honour was not able to conclude that the complainant's grievous bodily harm resulted from the punch thrown by the appellant.  The precise extent to which each assault contributed to the totality of the complainant's injuries could not be ascertained.  It remained a ""reasonable possibility that the grievous bodily harm was caused by the man who struck the complainant around the corner or by a combination of that man and the accused"" (Judgment 7 April 2011, p 18).  In these circumstances the only conclusion open to his Honour was that the complainant suffered at least actual (though not grievous) bodily harm as a result of the appellant's punch.  An inability to identify with precision the extent of harm inflicted did not preclude the finding that actual bodily harm was undoubtedly inflicted by the appellant.
54This ground of appeal should be rejected.  
GROUND 6:  ""THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED BY FINDING 'VERY MANY ASSAULTS DO NOT WARRANT SENTENCES OF IMPRISONMENT AT ALL BUT WHERE A PERSON OF LARGE BUILD STRIKES ANOTHER CAUSING HIM SOME HARM FOR NO APPARENT REASON WITH NO JUSTIFICATION OFFERED THEN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IN MY OPINION WARRANTS A SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT'""
55The appellant's submission in relation to this ground was similar to that made in relation to ground 4, that is, that the statement that the appellant acted ""for no apparent reason"" ignored the reasons that the appellant gave for striking the complainant.
56For the same reasons that I gave in connection with ground 4 (see [50] - [51] above), I would reject this ground of appeal.
RESENTENCING
57The appellant is to be sentenced for an offence under s 59(1) of the Crimes Act.  As pointed out earlier, it is not an element of this offence that the offender acted ""in the company of another person or persons"".  The difference between the offences created by s 59(1) and (2) is significant as the maximum penalty for an offence under s 59(1) is imprisonment for 5 years compared to 7 years for an offence under s 59(2).  The significance is also illustrated by the terms of the then Attorney-General's Second Reading Speech in relation to the Act (Crimes Amendment (Gang and Vehicle Related Offences) Act No 84 of 2001) that introduced sub-section 2 into the Act.  The Honourable Mr Debus referred to the bill he presented as ""a multifaceted approach to the issue of gang related activity"" and said that ""[t]he criminal law recognises that a crime committed by two or more persons together is more serious than when an offender acts alone"".
58Relevant to the objective seriousness of the appellant's offence is that he must be sentenced upon the basis that the Crown did not prove that his punch caused anything greater than some unidentified actual bodily harm.  This harm, although not trivial, nevertheless cannot be taken to have been of any particular seriousness.  Of significance is the fact that the blow constituted aggressive, potentially dangerous, conduct, engaged in without justification.  
59The appellant's criminal record included various driving offences in 2002 and 2003 including one ""Drive vehicle in manner that menaces other with intent to menace"" (Criminal history, NSW Police Force, 18 February 2011, p 3).  The appellant was also convicted in 2003 of ""Resist officer in execution of duty"" (ibid p 3) and in 2007 of ""Affray"" (ibid p 3), for each of which offences he received a 12 month bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
60So far as the appellant's personal circumstances are concerned, his Honour observed that the appellant is a powerfully built man who has ambitions to join the Australian Army.  At the time of sentencing by his Honour the appellant lived at home with his parents and had a lawful occupation that was interrupted by his involvement in these proceedings (Probation and Parole Service Pre-Sentence Report, 20 May 2011, p 1).  He resumed full-time employment whilst subject to the Intensive Correction Order which commenced on 29 July 2011.  He was supported by references that described him, in one case, as ""caring and kind ... devoted and compassionate"" (Letter dated 10 May 2011) and in another as ""an honest, genuine and a kind natured individual"" (Letter dated 17 May 2011, p 1).  As noted by Dr Gregory Levenston, the appellant ""stands on the threshold of his adult life"" (Bronte Medical Centre Report, 13 May 2011) and the decision of this Court has the potential to steer its commencement in a propitious direction.  Accordingly, the views of the appellant's referees that he is a ""man of honesty and integrity"" who ""will contribute to society in a positive and productive manner"" (Letter dated 10 May 2011) assume importance in the sentencing process and suggest that the appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation (see s 21A(3)(h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).
61In my view a sentence of imprisonment is not warranted in respect of this isolated act of aggression that was not proved to have caused significant harm.  Whilst the conduct of the appellant is to be condemned, I consider that it would sufficiently satisfy the purposes of sentencing identified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, including punishment, deterrence and protection of the community, for the appellant to be ordered to undertake 150 hours of community service work.  The appellant has been assessed as suitable for a community service order and has signed an undertaking to this effect pursuant to s 86 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
62As it appears that in his partial performance of the Intensive Correction Order made on 22 July 2011, the appellant should have undertaken community service for almost half of this period, I would limit the order now made to 75 hours of community service work.
63For the reasons that I have given, I propose that the following orders be made:
(1) Leave granted under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise Additional Ground of Appeal 2.
(2) Appeal allowed.
(3) The appellant's conviction on 7 April 2011 of an offence under s 59(2) of the Crimes Act is quashed.
(4) The appellant is convicted of an offence under s 59(1) of the Crimes Act that he did on 9 August 2009 at Surry Hills in the State of New South Wales assault Mathew Cunneen Wyllie thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm.
(5) The appellant is directed to perform 75 hours of community service work.  The appellant is to attend the City District Office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days of the date of this judgment.
64RS HULME J:  I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Macfarlan JA.  I agree with his Honour that, for the reasons his Honour gives, the appeal against conviction should be allowed.
65I disagree with his Honour as to the sentence which should be imposed upon the Appellant for the offence of assault.  While I accept that the Appellant's offence was an isolated act of aggression that was not proved to have caused significant harm, there are limits to the weight to be given to this latter circumstance.  Certainly, the injury inflicted could have been greater, but if too much greater, it was liable to amount to grievous bodily harm and the character of the offence substantially more serious.  Furthermore, the seriousness with which the legislature views conduct such as the Appellants must also be borne in mind.  His offence, of inflicting actual but not grievous bodily harm, rendered him liable to imprisonment for 5 years - Crimes Act 1900, s 59.  Mere common assault, ie, without occasioning any bodily harm, renders an offender liable to imprisonment for 2 years - s 61.  
66The fact that the Appellant's action was an ""isolated act of aggression"" must also be judged in light of his not insubstantial record.  
67He has previously been convicted:-
(i) In 2002, of, inter alia, on two occasions driving a vehicle recklessly, furiously or in a speed or manner dangerous to the public for which offences two Community Service Orders were imposed;
(ii) in 2002, resisting or hindering a police officer in the execution of his duty for which he was given a 6 month bond;
(iii) in 2003, of driving a vehicle in a manner that menaces with intent to menace and also of assault for which offences another two Community Service Orders were imposed;
(iv) in 2003, of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty for which a 12 month bond was imposed;  and
(v) in 2007, of affray for which he received a third bond.
68Given this prolonged history of antisocial behaviour, I would regard it as quite inappropriate that the Appellant receive yet more leniency by way of a Community Service Order.  He is a thug who has not learnt, from prior chances he has been given, as to how to behave in a civilised society.
69That conclusion is reinforced by evidence which was provided to the Court after the hearing of the appeal pursuant to orders then made and with a view to the Court being able to re-sentence should that be necessary.  That evidence consisted, in part, of an affidavit of the solicitor for the Appellant which was received on 1 March 2012 which indicated, inter alia, that the Appellant had undertaken some short term but later full time employment and, apart from four days when he provided medical certificates, had performed community work duties each Sunday during August to December 2011.  (I infer the reference to December was intended to encompass only that part of December prior to the Appellant being given bail.)  
70In response, the Crown provided an affidavit from a Ms Rottenberg, solicitor in the employ of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which annexed a report from a Compliance and Monitoring Officer of the Department of Corrective Services.  That report records that the Appellant had been significantly non-compliant with the requirements of the Department, had failed to attend 11 of 20 compulsory work component days, providing medical certificates for only four of these days and had failed to attend induction programmes on two occasions.  However, no breach action had been initiated.
71The Court orders provided for the Appellant to file further material if there remained any issue consequent on any affidavit filed by the Crown.  No further material was received.
72I appreciate that he has already served something over four months under the Intensive Correction Order imposed by Finnane DCJ, but it seems to me that form of penalty is one which should remain notwithstanding the fact that the offence for which the Appellant is now to be sentenced is assault occasioning actual bodily harm, not the more serious offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company for which he was sentenced by Finnane DCJ.
73Given the reduction in the gravity of the offence, it is appropriate to reduce the length of the Appellant's sentence from that imposed by his Honour.  Subject to the Appellant being given credit for time served, he should be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 6 months to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order.  The time served pursuant to the orders of Finnane DCJ prior to being granted bail amounted to 4 months and 1 week.  Accordingly, I would impose a further sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order for a period of 1 month and 3 weeks.  However, in light of the fact that mine is a minority view, it is unnecessary for me to formulate precise orders.
74RA HULME J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

I also granted leave to the second defendant/first cross-defendant to file in court a defence to the first cross-claim (T 1-3).

The plaintiff's accident

7The circumstances in which the plaintiff came to suffer injuries are as follows. About two weeks before the accident, the plaintiff took up duties at Gate Gourmet by arrangement with his employer, Blue Collar. On 2 April 2007, while carrying out his work duties, the plaintiff was required to enter the cool room in order to fill an order for butter products. When he went into the cool room, a trolley which was loaded with containers of orange juice blocked his way. The plaintiff needed to move the trolley in order to get to the dairy products. These were stacked in boxes against the wall behind the trolley. When the plaintiff tried to move the trolley, it began toppling towards him. He attempted to push the wire frame at the back of the trolley to stop it from falling, but was unsuccessful. In the course of attempting to push the wire frame at the back of the trolley, he grabbed the back through the mesh with his hands and, as a result, his left hand suffered injury. 

8The trolley initially came to rest on the plaintiff's knees and then fell completely to the ground. The plaintiff called out for help and his supervisor, a man known to him only as ""Sonny"", and the leading hand, a man called ""Parnell"", came running in. He told them both what had happened. At Sonny's request, he completed an entry in a registry of injury form which he and Sonny both signed. He was told by Sonny to go straight to the company doctor, a Dr Kyriazis, at Green Square, which he did. Dr Kyriazis put his hand in a splint, and he was issued with a WorkCover certificate. That WorkCover certificate, which is contained in Exhibit A, states that the injury occurred when the trolley fell onto his hands, identifies the plaintiff's employer, and certifies him as being unfit for work.

9Dr Kyriazis also referred him to Dr Myers, a hand specialist. Dr Myers similarly records the injury to the left finger at work, the trolley falling on his hand, and the development of immediate pain at swelling. He recommended surgery. 

10The circumstances of the plaintiff's accident and injuries are dealt with in more detail below.

The issues for determination

11The issues for determination are as follows:

(a)The nature and extent of injuries suffered by the plaintiff;

(b)Whether the plaintiff can establish that the accident occurred as a result of the negligence of one or both of the defendants;

(c)Apportionment of liability between the defendants; and

(d)Quantum.

The plaintiff's evidence

12The plaintiff, who is now 48 years of age, attended school to year 9 and did not obtain his school certificate. He obtained a forklift driver's licence and a heavy vehicle driver's licence, and carried out manual labouring work for most of his working life. He became interested in traffic control and obtained a traffic control certificate from WorkCover so that he could work in a business set up by a friend, which consisted of monitoring and supervising road closures. After about three years, as this business was not a success, he returned to manual work, registering with Blue Collar at the beginning of 2007. Blue Collar sent him to work at the airport and, about two weeks prior to the accident, to Gate Gourmet, where he was required to pick up orders, drive a forklift, unload trucks and generally assist in the assembling of food products for Gate Gourmet for use in relation to airport food orders. 

13When the plaintiff first went to the premises of Gate Gourmet, no one from Blue Collar accompanied him. He was shown around the premises by two Gate Gourmet employees, Sonny and the leading hand, Parnell. Once he had been shown the premises by them, he was left to do whatever he thought was right in relation to filling the orders he had to fill (T 28).

14The premises at Gate Gourmet contained a cool room for products which had to be kept under refrigeration. These products, as well as the other products which were being assembled in accordance with the orders, and were moved around the premises on trolleys. The plaintiff was asked at T 30:

""Q. Did you on any of those occasions experience any difficulties with the movement of any trolleys?
A. Yes.

Q. What did you notice in that respect?
A. They were all off balance, wonky, half of them were caved in, just the back of them was all caved in and bent, and when you pushed them like they'd wobble like that, and

Q. Well, you're meaning they wobbled laterally? Is that what you're trying to describe?
A. Seven out of ten were bad, yeah, yeah."" (T 30)

15The plaintiff said that many of these trolleys were ""just rubbish"" (T 30), but that it was no use complaining about their conduction:

""Q. When you noticed that some of these trolley were in the shape that you've described, did you do anything about it?
A. You just - you were just told to use it or find a good one. If you couldn't find a good one, deal with it. So you just dealt with it."" (T 31)

16Part of the premises were set aside for maintenance and repairs. This was a section of Gate Gourmet about 20 metres on the left of the storeroom. Prior to his accident, the plaintiff had taken several trolleys there because they were ""just no good"" (T 31). He said that the maintenance yard was simply a big yard full of broken trolleys and shelving (T 32).

17On the day in question, the plaintiff was told by Parnell to start filling orders, as there were no trucks to be unloaded. The plaintiff took one of the order forms, which required him to fetch dairy products, and went into the cool room. At the time, Sonny was in his office and Parnell was picking up another order. 

18When he arrived, the plaintiff was unable to get to the dairy product section because there was a trolley loaded with orange juice in front of him. He described the trolley and its location on T 36 as follows:

""Q. The box, the size of the box, did it - were they to the back of the trolley, to the forward of the trolley, in the centre or sort of all over the place or can't you remember?
A. They were just stuck to the - all I saw was the back of them. They were two stacks high at the top and the bottom was all stacked up.

Q. So was it fully laden or were there gaps on it?
A. Fully laden, yeah.

Q. Fully laden?
A. Yeah, yeah.

Q. Was there one trolley or more than one trolley that was like this?
A. There was a couple of trolleys in there. There was.

Q. In relation to the dairy products that you were after, where were the trolleys?
A. In front of it.

Q. So that to get to the dairy products, did you have to do something to at least one of the trolleys?
A. Had to move - had to move it.

Q. Move it in which way?
A. To the left.

Q. So you mean sideways?
A. I just grabbed it. Yes. Just touched it to the left to move it.

Q. So was the trolley positioned so that it appears in the photograph in front of you length to length, parallel with the wall with the dairy products?
A. Parallel to the - yes, yes, yes."" (T 36)

19As it was necessary to move the trolley in order to get to the dairy products which were necessary to fill his order, the plaintiff had needed to move the trolley, which he commenced to do:

""Q. You've told us that the dairy products were on the shelving behind the trolley.
A. Yeah.

Q. How far from the shelf was the trolley positioned?
A. About half a metre. 

Q. When you came into the cool room, what did you do?
A. Moved the trolley to the left to get behind it and it just fell on me.

Q. Well, what physically did you do to try and move the trolley to the left?
A. I just touched it. I didn't move the trolley, I just--

Q. Did you apply some force to try and move it?
A. Just a bit, yeah. Just to the left, yeah, just walked in and grabbed it - moved it to the left. 

Q. When you tried to move it to the left, did it move, or not?
A. It just fell straight on me."" (T 37)

20The plaintiff explained what happened in more detail at T 37 line 42:

""A. Tried to push it back up, because of the weight of it, it was pushing me backwards. So I leant it on me shoulders to get me hands under it, because I knew I couldn't get it back up. So I got it from here and me hands behind the mesh and it dropped and it just took me hands with it. Then it fell on it to me knees to like this and then I had to try and let it go and just back, and that's what I did, because otherwise it would've got me head as well. So this is on me knees, then I just moved me hands and just back and it's dropped to the ground."" (T 37)

21The plaintiff was able to jump back so that the trolley could drop to the ground but his hand had been caught in the mesh. There was a ""big bang"" (T 39) and Sonny and Parnell came running into the room. Sonny said, ""What happened?"" and the plaintiff replied, ""The trolley just fell on me"". Parnell said, ""Who loaded that trolley?"" and Sonny said, ""The trolley's faulty, it should never ever [sic] been loaded.""

22Sonny said to Parnell, ""Can you go in and take the boxes off it?"" and then asked the plaintiff to go out, get into the forklift truck and take the faulty trolley down to the maintenance section. Parnell, however, put the trolley onto the forklift, which was parked outside the dock about 15 metres away, as the plaintiff's hand was ""killing me"" (T 41). He did not have a chance to look at the trolley when it was loaded onto the forklift. He managed to drive the forklift as far as the maintenance section, where he left it against the wall, along with all the other broken trolleys.

23The plaintiff then went back to the storeroom, where he spoke to Sonny, who said, ""You'll be off to go the doctors [sic]"" (T 42). Sonny also said, ""Your hand looks bad. You'll have to go and get it looked at"" (T 43). The plaintiff said, ""Where do I go?"" and Sonny replied, ""Green Square"" (T 43). Sonny gave the plaintiff the address of the company doctor by writing it down and also gave him an accident report. He asked the plaintiff to tell him what had happened and he saw Sonny writing on a piece of paper which appeared to be a notepad or pad. The plaintiff repeated what he had earlier said in the cool room and after Sonny had written it down, the plaintiff signed it. He then went to the nominated doctor at Green Square. He had been there once before, for a physical assessment, when he was first employed by Blue Collar, but otherwise had not previously attended this doctor's surgery.

24The plaintiff saw Dr Kyriazis, who examined his hand, put a splint in place, wrote a prescription for Panadol Forte and gave him a medical certificate, which the plaintiff took back to Gate Gourmet. The medical certificate gave the plaintiff five days off work. This was effectively a week, as the day of the accident had been Monday, so this meant that he needed to take the rest of the week off work. 

25The plaintiff's hand was still ""killing"" (T 47) him, but he managed to drive to and from the doctor, and then to drive home. He was told to return to the doctor later that week. The doctor sent him for an x-ray and as soon as the doctor had seen the x-ray, he telephoned Dr Myers and arranged for the plaintiff to see him immediately (T 48). The plaintiff then went to see Dr Myers at Prince of Wales Hospital who said that the hand ""needed operating on straightaway"" (T 49) and arranged for the operation to take place the following Tuesday. Dr Myers considered it so urgent who tried to get him in earlier, but he was unable to cancel any prior surgery (T 49). 

26The plaintiff was suffering from what he called ""shocking pain"" (T 49) until the day of the surgery. He was unable to sleep or indeed to do anything. He could not drive his car, although on one occasion he did manage to drive back to Dr Myers because his wife was unavailable to drive him. He filled out a workers compensation form in order to advise Blue Collar that he had suffered an injury (T 50-51). He was admitted to hospital and underwent surgery. The plaintiff's surgery and medical condition are described in more detail in the section of this judgment concerning quantum.

27The plaintiff continued to receive worker's compensation payments. He underwent physiotherapy (T 54), took Mersyndol Forte (T 55), which cut the pain out ""for a little while"" (T 55), and remained at home. He was ""no good"" (T 56) emotionally at this time. He had nothing to do apart from looking for employment; his spent 12 months at the CRS trying to find employment.

28The plaintiff was anxious about money, as he had a wife to support. His wife was working, and an son just out of his teens also lived at home with them. The worker's compensation payments were less than his salary. On or about 20 September 2007, about five months after his accident, the plaintiff was caught by police carrying a substantial amount of drugs and money in his car. On 2 February 2009, the plaintiff was sentenced to imprisonment for two years commencing 20 September 2007. There is little information about the circumstances in which the crime was committed, save that when he was apprehended, there was $26,000 in his car, $11,000 of which he claimed to police was his, although he told the court in these proceedings that in fact he was only going to be paid $1,000 for delivering both this money and the substantial amount of drugs also found in his vehicle. I note, in relation to this sentence, that the plaintiff had a juvenile conviction, and in 1993 received a fine for possessing and self-administering a prohibited drug, but he was otherwise unknown to police. The circumstances in which he was arrested for this offence are of relevance in relation to his future economic loss and create problems for his claim for past domestic care. 

29The plaintiff received some treatment while in jail, although this was limited, and this has impacted upon his condition, in that he was unable to obtain physiotherapy or take the medication he had taken before his incarceration (T 58).

30Following his release, the plaintiff endeavoured to obtain employment and completed the 12 months CRS course, but developed regional pain syndrome, which is discussed in more detail in the section of this judgment on quantum below.

The plaintiff's other witnesses

31The plaintiff's wife was called. Her evidence is discussed in more detail in the section of this judgment on home care below.

32The plaintiff tendered expert reports from HL Burn & Associates dated 16 November 2010 and 2 December 2011. The plaintiff also relied upon the Employers Mutual Indemnity - Initial Notification of Injury Form of 2 April 2007 and the Workers Compensation Claim Form of 15 June 2007.

The evidence of the defendants

33The first defendant, during the plaintiff's evidence in chief, raised an objection to hearsay evidence from the plaintiff concerning statements made by its employees ""Sonny"" and ""Parnell"". I deferred ruling upon this until the evidence from the defendant was led. The defendant did not call either of these witnesses, or indeed any witness, and I was not asked to rule upon the exclusion of the plaintiff's evidence of what they said. No objection was taken pursuant to s 69 Civil Liability Act to the plaintiff's evidence of admissions by Sonny as to knowledge of the faulty trolley.

34In addition to calling no evidence from Sonny or Parnell (or any other employee), the first defendant failed to answer two subpoenae (9-10, 14-15, 70-74). The first of these was issued by the plaintiff on 9 July 2010 (Exhibit D1) and sought the following documentation:

(1)All plans, sketches, diagrams, photographs, reports, service books, brochures, instruction manuals, publications and films in relation to the process the Applicant was engaged in at the time of the accident.

(2)All plans, sketches, diagrams, photographs, reports, service books, brochures, instruction manuals, publications and films in relation to any machine the Applicant was working on or with at the time of the accident.

(3)All instructions, memoranda, books, publications, notices, notes, reports, documents, films and correspondence relating in any way, wholly or partly, to safety aspects of the process the Applicant was engaged in at the time of the accident.

(4)All memoranda, notes, reports, correspondence and other documents in relation to any visit by any representative of the Department of Industrial Relations and Technology in respect of the accident to the Applicant.

(5)All memoranda, notes, reports, correspondence and other documents relating to any alterations, after the accident to the Applicant, of the manner in which the process in which the Applicant was engaged at the time of the accident operated or was carried out.

(6)All memoranda, notes, reports, correspondence and other documents in relation to any prosecution by the Department of Industrial Relations and Technology in respect of either the accident to the Applicant or the manner in which the Applicant was engaged at the time of the accident operated or was carried out.

(7)All memoranda, notes, reports, correspondence and other documents in relation to any other accidents occurring:

(i)in a similar manner to that in which the Applicant was injured; and

(ii)on the same work process as the Applicant was engaged upon at the time of the accident.

(8)All reports of injury, claims for compensation, statements by the Applicant, statements by witnesses, other statements, investigative or other reports, films, plans, sketches, diagrams, photographs, accident report books, notes, memoranda, correspondence, medical certificates, medical reports and all other documents in relation to the Applicant's accident, disabilities and employment.

(9)All memoranda, notes, reports, correspondence and other documents in relation to the Applicant's employment and any terminating of, or resignation by, the Applicant from that employment.

(10)All copies and drafts of any of the documents referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above.

(11)All correspondence or copy correspondence between you and your workers compensation insurer or any other person or company in relation to the Applicant's accident, injuries, disabilities, employment or fitness for work.

(12)Details of weekly earnings of the Applicant (including ordinary wages, overtime, bonuses, penalty rates and all other allowances and payments) and of all deductions.

(13)Details of weekly earnings of three (3) employees engaged in similar wage terms, in similar categories and positions of employment, and undertaking similar duties to the Applicant (including ordinary wages, payments for overtime, bonuses, penalty rates and all other allowances and payments) and of all deductions.

(14)Details of all absences from work of the including particulars of reasons, if any, ascribed therefrom by the Applicant, or any one on his behalf, and of all certificates or other documents relating thereof furnished by or on behalf of the Applicant or any one on his behalf.

(15)All books, cards, files and other records of First Aid attendance upon and medical reports relating to the Applicant while in your employ.

(16)Your entire personnel file in relation to the Applicant.

(17)The register of injuries required to be kept under Section 90 of the Workers Compensation Act, 1987.

35This subpoena was served on Gate Gourmet Property Pty Ltd. That was in fact another company in the group, and not the defendant. However, the same solicitors acted for both companies, and responded to this subpoena, stating that no documents were produced. The documents sought included records the first defendant was required to keep, such as the register of injuries required to be kept under s 90 Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) and the form signed both by the plaintiff and Sonny on the day of the accident.

36A second subpoena for these documents was issued on 17 January 2012. This time, it was addressed to the correct company, namely the first defendant. It sought the following documents:

(1)All reports, records, files, documents, invoices etc; in relation to the repair, maintenance, replacement of trolleys at the defendants premises at 263 King Street, Mascot NSW 2020.

(2)Any documents in relation to the system of repair and recording of any defects of the trolleys.

(3)Staff roster for the date of the Plaintiff's accident and duties allocated to each member of staff and their job description.

37Apart from some pro forma signs for faulty trolleys, none of these documents were produced.

38A notice to produce was called upon during the trial (T 72). It was mentioned on a number of occasions. At the opening of Mr Kettle's closing submissions (T 177), he produced documents he said were provided in response to the call, but those documents were conceded to be of no relevance to the categories of documents sought by the plaintiff or to the issues in these proceedings.

39Mr Kettle said (T 178) that he was ""not going to dwell on liability"" but that he still made a substantive case on the evidence (T 178).

40The first defendant also tendered a report of Dr Nathan Kinkaid (Exhibit 1). Dr Kinkaid's report is, however, limited to the mechanics of the accident, namely the force needed to move a trolley, and differing scenarios of a trolley toppling with one locked wheel, one broken wheel, two locked wheels, locked wheels where it is pushed to the side, locked wheels being pushed directly to the left and misaligned force and the location of the overturned trolley.

41The second defendant called no oral evidence.

42The first and second defendant also tendered medical and other reports concerning the plaintiff's injuries which are discussed in more detail below. The second defendant called no oral evidence. 

43I also note that the defendants relied upon evidence in the proceedings generally in support of the issues relevant to the cross-claim.

The liability of the defendants

44The second defendant made concessions as to the non-delegable duty of care (T 200) and drew my attention to labour-hire cases such as Maricic v Dalma Formwork (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 174 in relation to the liability of the first defendant. Mr Campbell, for the plaintiff, and Mr Robertson, for the second defendant, submitted that the first defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff analogous to that of an employer, which duty included the obligation to provide a safe system of work and safe plant and equipment in accordance with s 5B Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). In the course of discharge of that duty, a reasonable person in the position of the first defendant would have foreseen a risk of injury likely to result from the failure to maintain that equipment, given the necessity to use the trolleys for persons working at the premises, whose job it was to collect goods to fill orders by using these trolleys. A reasonable person would, for the purposes of s 5B(2), respond by implementing an appropriate system of detection of trolleys with problems and maintenance with respect to defects, visible problems and problems reported by staff. 

45In relation to the failure of the first defendant to lead any evidence at all concerning any system of maintenance, inspection or the like, and where documents in relation to this were not produced under subpoena, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the evidentiary burden was far lighter than in Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5. He submitted that the total absence of evidence from the first defendant was significant. As the High Court in Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks (1957) 97 CLR 367 noted, information such as (in the present case) the poor state of maintenance of the trolleys is a fact peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, whose responsibility it was to maintain control of the premises. In such circumstances, ""slight evidence may be enough"", as Dixon CJ noted in Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks at 371:

""[A] plaintiff is not relieved of the necessity of offering some evidence of negligence by the fact that the material circumstances are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant; all that it means is that slight evidence may be enough unless explained away by the defendant and that the evidence should be weighted according to the power of the party to produce it, in accordance with the often repeated observation of Lord Mansfield in Blatch v. Archer [1774] Eng R 2; (1774) 1 Cowp 63, at p 65 [1774] Eng R 2; (98 ER 969, at p 970) : cf. Parker v. Paton (1941) 41 SR (NSW) 237; 58 WN 189 ; Ex parte Ferguson; Re Alexander (1944) 45 SR (NSW) 64; 62 WN 15 . (at p372)""

46The absence of the first defendant's records for the accident is surprising. Section 90 Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) requires the keeping of a register of injuries, and it should have been produced whether the plaintiff's name was there or not. No documents were produced relating to the plaintiff, or any injuries suffered by him, or any circumstances concerning his injury, yet the plaintiff, in unchallenged evidence (other than in relation to the hearsay component) stated that not only did he report that injury to the two men he named, but that when he went back to the office he saw one of those men filling out a form in a notebook, which was then signed. Counsel for the plaintiff invited me to infer that not only did the first defendant have a haphazard system for the recording of injury, but also for the carrying out of maintenance, and that the plaintiff's description of what was said, namely to just get on and use the equipment and stop complaining, was an accurate description of the lack of system of the first defendant.

47What inferences, if any, should be drawn from failure to produce documents in answer to subpoena or discovery? In LJP Investments Pty Ltd v Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd (1989) 24 NSWLR 490 at 508, Hodgson JA stated that the court should adopt a ""robust"" approach to proof where the actions of a party ""whose actions have made an accurate determination so problematic"", citing Armory v Delamirie (1722) 1 Stra 505; 93 ER 664. 

48Where the party who does not produce the documents is asserted to be a wrongdoer, the inference may be more readily drawn. In Houghton v Immer (No 155) Pty Ltd (1997) 44 NSWLR 46 at 59 Handley JA founded the ""robust"" assessment on the defendants' wrongdoing, as well as on their failure to keep records:

""The defendants, having improved common property without lawful authority, and attempted to effect a fraud on the minority, are wrongdoers, and their failure to keep and produce proper accounts of their actual expenditure on the common property has made it difficult to assess the compensation due to the plaintiff: compare Armory v Delamirie (1722) 1 Stra 505; 93 ER 664. In my judgment the Court should assess the compensation in a robust manner, relying on the presumption against wrongdoers, the onus of proof, and resolving doubtful questions against the party ""whose actions have made an accurate determination so problematic"": see LJP Investments Pty Ltd v Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd.""

49These principles were restated in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Optus Networks Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 333 at [246] per Giles JA. The High Court, in Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd (2004) 216 CLR 388 at [74], footnoted these decisions for the proposition that the trial judge ""may think it proper to draw inferences in favour of [the plaintiffs] if it is concluded that the respondent's wrong itself made quantification difficult"", as Giles JA noted in McCartney v Orica Investments Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 337 at [156].

50It is not clear whether there is one rule for omission (failing to produce the documents without offering any explanation) and another for commission (admitting to having destroyed a document). In the above cases, the wrongdoings included fraud and failure to keep (and produce) proper accounts, which appear to blur the line between commission and omission. In all these cases, the compulsory process of discovery and interrogatories was also available, rather than the uncertainties of documents produced in answer to subpoenae, a significant feature of personal injury litigation, where discovery is not available and the party issuing the subpoena or notice to produce is dependent upon the honesty and competence of the party answering the call.

51McCartney was handed down shortly after the Court of Appeal's dismissal of an appeal in a case raising the same problem, namely Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2010] NSWDC 332, where a partial failure to comply with a request for further and better discovery (as opposed to total failure to produce documents) had more drastic results. These were defamation proceedings where discovery and interrogatories had already been used by both parties, who were about to go to trial. Shortly before the trial, the defendants sought additional discovery of the plaintiff's ""mobile phone and/or Facebook and/or Myspace pages"" (at [8]). The plaintiff produced Facebook and Myspace pages but only discovered one of the five mobile phones she had owned, and then only in Part 2 of the relevant list. One of the mobile phones clearly contained evidence relevant to the case (at [20]). The trial judge was satisfied that the plaintiff had deliberately disposed of two mobile phones for the purposes of evading her discovery obligations (at [67]), and struck out part of her claim. This decision was affirmed on appeal: Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 264. Another action brought by the same plaintiff was dismissed (as an abuse of process) in its entirety on this basis: Palavi v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 274. 

52Another, although less extreme, step, is the stay of proceedings where a party refuses to cooperate in the production of relevant records: Merkuloff v Yalisheff [2003] NSWSC 1183. A stay was ordered in those proceedings even though discovery and interrogatories were (as Young CJ in Eq noted) also available as a means of compelling production. Such a remedy would have particular force in personal injury actions, where discovery is not available, but stays have rarely been sought, and generally only in the case of plaintiffs who withhold pension entitlement details: Attard v Hore [2002] QSC 437; El-Helou v Smith [2009] NSWSC 741. In El-Helou, Harrison J ordered a plaintiff to provide authority to a defendant in relation to Centrelink claims made both by herself and by her husband, on the basis that they were relevant to claims for economic loss and home care claims. Harrison J noted specific references to s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) by Gzell J in Wray v Wray [2007] NSWSC 164 (at [12]) and by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd v Cassar [2009] NSWCA 230 at [36]. In particular, her Honour noted the statement of Young CJ in Eq in Merkuloff v Yalisheff at [17]:

""[17] When a person does bring proceedings in this Court, he or she is under an obligation to assist the court in coming to a fair conclusion. If a person deliberately says to their opponent and to the court ""I will not co-operate"" then the usual consequence is that their action is stayed until they do co-operate.""

53This suggests that plaintiffs, rather than defendants, are most at risk from such orders, which may have been a factor in Palavi. However, the more significant difference ought to be that in all these non-personal injury cases, both plaintiff and defendant had other remedies for failure by an opponent to produce documents, including, as Young CJ in Eq noted in Merkuloff v Yalisheff, discovery and interrogatories. In none of these cases was there total failure to provide documents by a defendant who was a large corporate entity with statutory record keeping obligations, as is the case here. 

54In the present circumstances, there has been failure to answer a subpoena on at least one occasion before the trial, and to provide the relevant documents pursuant to a notice to produce during the trial, even though the solicitors for the first defendant were aware (in that they responded in relation to the first subpoena to the wrongly named company) that these documents had long been sought, and were relevant to the claim. Those documents, if obtained, could have enabled the plaintiff to:

(a)Identify who ""Sonny"" and ""Parnell"" were, so that they could be interviewed and, if necessary, called to give evidence;

(b)Assist the experts in the case to analyse the mechanics of the collapse of the trolley;

(c)Provide information about the system of maintenance of the trolleys, any prior complaints or injuries and any steps taken following the plaintiff's accident.

55These documents may also have been significant to the issue of causation. In considering the provisions of s 5D, the High Court in Strong v Woolworths Ltd stated at [20]:

""Under the statute, factual causation requires proof that the defendant's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the particular harm. A necessary condition is a condition that must be present for the occurrence of the harm. However, there may be more than one set of conditions necessary for the occurrence of particular harm and it follows that a defendant's negligent act or omission which is necessary to complete a set of conditions that are jointly sufficient to account for the occurrence of the harm will meet the test of factual causation within s 5D(1)(a). In such a case, the defendant's conduct may be described as contributing to the occurrence of the harm. This is pertinent to the appellant's attack on the Court of Appeal's reasons, which is directed to par 48 of the judgment: 
""Now, apart from the 'exceptional case' that section 5D(2) recognises, section 5D(1) sets out what must be established to conclude that negligence caused particular harm. That emerges from the words 'comprises the following elements' in the chapeau to section 5D(1). 'Material contribution', and notions of increase in risk, have no role to play in section 5D(1). It well may be that many actions or omissions that the common law would have recognised as making a material contribution to the harm that a plaintiff suffered will fall within section 5D(1), but that does not alter the fact that the concepts of material contribution and increase in risk have no role to play in deciding whether section 5D(1) is satisfied in any particular case."" (emphasis in original)""

56The court further noted at [32]:

""The appellant was required to prove on the balance of probabilities that Woolworths' negligence was a necessary condition of her harm. Woolworths' negligence lay in its failure to employ a system for the periodic inspection and cleaning of the sidewalk sales area. Proof of the causal link between an omission and an occurrence requires consideration of the probable course of events had the omission not occurred. Here, the appellant was required to prove that, had a system of periodic inspection and cleaning of the sidewalk sales area been employed on the day of her fall, it is likely that the chip would have been detected and removed before she approached the entrance to Big W.""

57In the present case, the failure to produce documents, which includes the failure to produce records required by statute to be kept, is a total failure. It remains to be seen whether the principles discussed in Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd will be applied beyond the facts of that particular case. Since Palavi was not even cited in McCartney, this seems unlikely. Plaintiffs in personal injury litigation will have to content themselves with reliance upon Dixon CJ's observations in Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks. On that basis, having regard to the facts in this case, the plaintiff has no difficulty in establishing liability. 

58I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established that the accident occurred in the manner described, and that the accident occurred because of defective equipment, an unsafe system of work requiring faulty equipment to be used, and an unsafe and unsatisfactory system of failure to repair faculty equipment. 

59This brings me to the questions of contributory negligence, quantum, and to the apportionment of liability between the defendants.

Contributory negligence

60I note in addition that while a claim of contributory negligence was pleaded, no evidence was led by way of cross-examination and no submission was made (see T 208-209).

Quantum

Non-economic loss

61The plaintiff claims that economic loss for an injury of this kind falls within the margin 37.5 - 42.5% and claims 40%, which represents $208,000. The first defendant submits that 15 - 20% of the most extreme case would be the appropriate sum. The second defendant submits that 25% of the most extreme case would be the appropriate sum.

62This requires a careful analysis of the medical evidence. 

Dr Stuart Myers

63As the plaintiff's treating doctor, Dr Myers is best placed to comment on the plaintiff's injuries. In his report of 15 May 2007, he states:

""I agree he has some signs of a very mild complex regional pain syndrome effecting his left hand.In particular he has palmar fascial thickening. Purplish discolouration in the hand. Swelling. Significant stiffness and mild pain.He needs to aggressively increase his activity level. I will check him in two weeks time to see whether he requires formal review in a pain management setting but I doubt this will be the case. He remains unfit for work at this time.X-rays today reveal anatomical alignment of the fracture which has now united."" (Report of 15 May 2007, Exhibit A)

64Dr Myers expended on this report two weeks later as follows:

""I reviewed Harry KEMBLE on 28 May.He has a much more obvious complex regional pain syndrome affecting his left hand. He has burning pain over the dorsum of the index MCP joint and a cold sensation in the hand. He has diffusely altered sensation in the hand and significant colour change today. There is marked stiffness of all the fingers, but particularly the index finger.Harry's progress has been extremely slow. I think the time has come to organise formal pain management and I will ask him to see a Dr Khor in the Pain Clinic at Prince of Wales as soon as possible. I have reassured him that by using his hand he is not doing any damage. The fracture has united. I explained to him that the complex regional pain syndrome will triple or quadruple the time it takes to recover from his injury. He needs to continue with hand therapy and may need prolonged hand therapy."" (Report of 28 May 2007, Exhibit A)

65Dr Myers repeated in a report of 25 June 2007 that the plaintiff was ""frustrated"" and ""significantly distressed"" by the ongoing dysfunction on his left hand, which was ""obvious"", and added in a further report of 6 August 2007 that his position had not changed.

66After the plaintiff's release from jail, Dr Myers provided a report dated 14 July 2010 in which he stated as follows:

""Mr Kemble has ongoing signs of a complex regional pain syndrome in his left hand. He desperately needs to return to some form of employment as soon as possible.I wonder about his suitability for doing a counselling course. He is presently only taking 6 Mersyndol Forte a day. I wonder whether there is still a role for some Gabapentin but will leave this up to the Pain Clinic."" (Report of 14 July 2010, Exhibit A)

67There are reports from the Hand Injury Trauma Service - Physiotherapy (Exhibit A, pages 22-27). It is clear that the plaintiff is continuing to suffer as late as July 2010 from high levels of pain in his hand and swelling with activity. He was able to manage up to three kilograms with his left hand and could manage up to six kilograms in a two-handed lift. He was undergoing hand-strengthening exercises (Exhibit A, page 27).

68Dr Myers and the Hand Injury Trauma Service confirmed the degree of severity of the plaintiff's injury.

Dr Robert Adler

69Dr Adler provided two medico-legal reports dated 15 November 2009 and 25 June 2010. His opinion is as follows:

""DiagnosisMr Kemble has undergone left index finger internal fixation of a proximal phalanx fracture, with articular extension at the base. This was internally fixated surgically. This was complicated by Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type 1, resulting in hand swelling, severe pain and intolerance of even light touch. The hand remains stiffened, with inability to use the all important pinch grip between thumb and index finger, as the index finger is too sensitive to tolerate opposition with the thumb. The hand is clumsy and poorly functional."" (Report of 15 November 2009, Exhibit A)

70Dr Adler adds that this condition unfortunately often has a poor prognosis, resulting in permanent stiffening of the fingers and hand and long-term pain disorder, as well as later potential arthritis problems. He notes the problem caused by the plaintiff not having been able to obtain pain specialist therapy while he was in jail. In an updated report of 15 November, he notes that the condition has still not stablised.

71In his 25 June 2010 report, Dr Adler noted that the plaintiff continued to have the same symptoms of left hand pain that were unchanged. The index finger remained very sensitive and had difficulty tolerating any pressure. He suffered from excessive hand sweating, hot and cold discolouration, intermittent pins and needles and aching which was ""particularly distressing at times"". He had difficulty using his hand grasp objects and it remained clumsy. The condition remained similar to that observed in October 2009.

72He goes on to add:

""The Complex Regional Pain Syndrome should remain under the care of a Pain Specialist. He has trialled a number of treatments which have unfortunately not been successful. There is a limited role for physiotherapy treatment. Psychological counselling will be required, at times, to assist Mr Kemble in adjusting to this severe hand disability. He would require six hours a week domestic assistance and two hours a fortnight home maintenance assistance."" (Report of 25 June 2010, Exhibit A)

73Dr Alder has provided a short additional report setting out the eight criteria for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome to be diagnosed, noting that seven criteria were met so Complex Regional Pain Syndrome was not fulfilled as eight criteria are needed (Exhibit A, pages 83-84).

74Dr Adler has confirmed the ongoing nature and poor prognosis for the plaintiff's condition. He has made additional comments about need for assistance in home duties, which are the subject of additional comment in the section of this judgment relating to past and future domestic care.

Dr Henry Lam

75Dr Lam is pain medicine specialist. He has provided a report dated 25 March 2010 and a follow up report dated 7 May 2010. He describes the plaintiff's chronic persistent pain condition as follows:

""The pain is described as a constant pain with paroxysmal attacks as well as increase in intensity associated with activity. The characteristics of the pain are described as dull, aching, sharp, stabbing, hot, burning, throbbing, pulsing, paraesthesia and numbness. He describes allodynia, hyperalgesia and dysaesthesia. Mr Kemble reports his hand being hot and cold at times, sweaty and clammy. Pain radiates from the hand up the arm.Pain seems to be better with medication, getting up, moving and trying to take his mind off things, hot water [sic]. Pain seems to be exacerbated by using her [sic] hand, sneezing, using knife and fork."" (Exhibit A, page 86)

76Dr Lam, whose report was prepared for the assistance of Employers Mutual, the worker's compensation insurer, makes a series of recommendations for treatment of the plaintiff. 

77Dr Lam's follow up report describes the plaintiff as presenting in a state of considerable distress as his stepfather had just committed suicide. He said his pain had flared up and Dr Lam noted with concern that the plaintiff had still not received approval from WorkCover in relation to the Multidisciplinary Pain Management Plan. He noted that as Mr Kemble's Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire score was 132, he was at risk of developing a long term problem, as any score greater than 105 was indicative of this problem and one study had found that workers with a score higher than 130 failed to return to work (Exhibit A, page 91).

78In a subsequent report of 9 July 2010, Dr Lam noted with concern that the plaintiff had still not received approval to commence the Multidisciplinary Pain Management Plan, noting that it was important to consolidate the gains achieved by having him undergo this plan. The plaintiff was eventually given permission to commence the course on 7 February 2011. It was a course of 8 weeks. Dr Lam commented also commented on the importance of the plaintiff using his hand, in order to ensure his condition did not worsen.

79Dr Lam's reports substantially corroborate the opinion of the plaintiff's treating specialist, Dr Myers.

Associated Professor David Champion

80Associated Professor Champion is the Conjoint Associated Professor of Medicine at the University of New South Wales. He is a psychiatrist. He carefully sets out the plaintiff's medical history in a medico-legal report sought by the plaintiff's representatives.

81Associated Professor Champion notes that the injury not only affected his hand and his mood, but his general health, in that he had gained about 15 kilograms since the accident due to ""depressed eating"". He described this as a ""concerning post-accident feature"" (Exhibit A, page 98). These are of significance when assessing the plaintiff's non-economic loss in relation to matters other than the injury to his hand. 

Defendants' medical evidence

82The defendants relied upon the following reports.

Dr Neill McGill

83Dr Neil McGill, a rheumatologist, provided reports dated 13 October 2010 and 26 July 2011. Dr McGill confirms that the plaintiff did experience Complex Regional Pain Syndrome in the months following his injury but considers that, while he has some restriction of left index finger movement, he has largely recovered. He describes a lack of objective change (Exhibit 1, page 24), which he considers is suggestive of the plaintiff using his left hand in a regular fashion. He considers that the plaintiff can use his left hand normally without fear.

84In a further report of 26 July 2011, Dr McGill had the following to say:

""I refer to my report on Mr Kemble dated 13 October 2010. When I saw him he reported that he was using Mersyndol Forte about 6 daily and that he had been using a patch on the dorsum of his left hand although he was not wearing any patch when I saw him. He provided a history consistent with complex regional pain syndrome in the left hand following the avulsion fracture of the base of the left index proximal phalanx on 2 April 2007. The letters by Dr Myers supported the conclusion that Mr Kemble had suffered complex regional pain syndrome. When I saw him however there was no objective evidence of complex regional pain syndrome. Specifically there was no wasting, temperature alteration, sweating alteration, skin or hair change, nail change or x-ray [sic] evidence of osteoporosis. Thus I concluded that his complex regional pain syndrome had recovered. He demonstrated restricted flexion of the left index finger but that was the only abnormality.With respect to the claims that have been made on his behalf in regard to future medical expenses, the use of 28 Panadol tablets per week would represent reasonable simple analgesia if he felt the need.42 Nurofen (Ibuprofen 200mg) tablets per week I think would not be appropriate although that represents relatively low dose anti-inflammatory medication. Mr Kemble has hypertension (which anti-inflammatory mediation often aggravates) and the evidence does not suggest that he would expect to require that therapy. He was not using anti-inflammatory medication, based on the history he provided to me.I do not think there is indication for any of the other expenses listed in your letter in relation to his left hand. Thus he does not require four consultations per year with a general practitioner; twelve pain specialist consultations per year for two years; Stellate ganglion blocks; or physiotherapy treatments.He could benefit from assistance regaining employment from a case manager or similar person.With respect to whether he requires consultations with a psychologist, I did not detect anything that indicated such a need. I will leave it to those with expertise in psychological problems to comment further on that suggestion.With respect to his work capacity, he may have some difficulty performing actions that require fine movements with the left index finger. I think he would be fit to work as a machine operator, operate a fork lift, load and unload goods, perform storeman duties, traffic control and work as a baggage handler. Thus he is currently fit for types of work that he reported he had performed in the past."" (Report of 26 July 2011, Exhibit 1)

Dr Con Kafataris

85Dr Kafataris provided reports (Exhibit 2) dated 16 November 2010, 6 December 2010 and 25 October 2011. These reports were provided to WorkCover. 

86In his first report, Dr Kafataris notes the plaintiff's rehabilitation of the period of incarceration for drug related offences. He noted what he called a ""mild yet definite difference in colour for the left hand"", that it was visibly sweatier, swollen and shiny and generally indicated as diagnosis of Complex Region Pain Syndrome type 1. Range of motion for the thumb and second to fifth fingers was relatively well preserved. There was a difference of grip strength between the left and right hand in that the left hand could only grip seven kilograms whereas the right hand could grip 28 kilograms.

87Dr Kafataris comments:

""This worker's presentation is consistent with complex regional pain syndrome of the left hand. Whilst this is a condition that is over-diagnosed in my opinion in the workers compensation arena, there is consistency in this worker between the history and the physical findings. Essentially this condition is a long term problem characterised by persistent and recurrent pain often associated with abnormal autonomic phenomena such as colour changes, sweating, etc. The mainstay of treatment is functional restoration i.e. to improve functional capacity whilst assisting the worker to manage pain using CBT principles.A return to pre-injury duties is not the usual outcome for this condition."" (Report of 16 November 2010, page 3, Exhibit 2)

88Dr Kafataris concludes his report of 16 November 2010 by stating that these restrictions are likely to be long term and that it is unlikely that the plaintiff could return to his pre-injury duties. The work goal should be permanently modified duties.

89In his report of 6 December 2010, Dr Kafataris considered four potential forms of employment, noting that traffic control duties would be appropriate.

90Dr Kafataris' report of 25 October 2011 is a report in reply to the report of Dr Lam, together with the updated opinion that the plaintiff's condition is ""largely unchanged"" (page 3). He does, however, consider that the plaintiff is capable of working full time hours and he notes that he is attempting home duties such as trying to vacuum, wash and ""clean up"".

Other reports

91I note an occupational therapy assessment and a report of a labour market analyst have also been tendered. These are dealt with elsewhere in this judgment. I also note that a report of Dr J D G Watson commissioned by Norton White (see Exhibit C) was not served. 

Conclusions concerning non-economic loss

92The first defendant submits that the evidence concerning the plaintiff's treatment is in conflict in that Dr McGill in his report of 13 October 2010 says that the plaintiff no longer has any objective symptoms, and that I should accept the latter.

93I do not accept this submission. While the medico-legal reports appear to take differing views as to the extent of the plaintiff's condition, the reports of the plaintiff's treating surgeon, Dr Myers, are quite unambiguous. Dr Myers was still observing purplish discolouration, palmar fascial thickening, limited index finger range of motion and pain, which he considered to be ongoing signs of a Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, as late as 14 July 2010. This is only three months before he saw Dr McGill. His condition is unlikely to have vanished overnight and I do not see how Dr McGill could have failed to observe this or, if the hand appears normal, why he did not explain how his observations were so different to those observed by the other medical practitioners.

94Reports of treating doctors have the advantage of being prepared by the doctor who has case managed and treated the injury concerned over a long period. Dr McGill saw the plaintiff only briefly, for the purpose of a medico-legal report.

95I prefer the carefully explained series of reports of Dr Myers to the opinion of Dr McGill and I am satisfied the plaintiff's hand problems are both ongoing and significant. 

96This brings me to the issue of what is an appropriate range for damages for non-economic loss for an injury to the plaintiff's non-dominant hand. In Clarence Valley Council v MacPherson (District Court of New South Wales, Flannery DCJ, 16 March 2011), the trial judge described an injury to the plaintiff's dominant right hand as ""catastrophic"", and assessed his non-economic loss at 30%, rejecting a submission by the plaintiff for 35%. The Court of Appeal (Clarence Valley Council v MacPherson [2011] NSWCA 422 at [82]) found that although the plaintiff had suffered a serious injury to his right wrist, he was ""generally pain free unless he lifts a heavy object or jars his wrist or otherwise subjects it to some form of trauma"" (at [82]). The Court considered the appropriate percentage was 25%. Accordingly, non-economic loss for the respondent was reduced to $33,800, representing 25%. In doing so, the Court also acknowledged the plaintiff suffered depression and a reduction in his ability to interact with his children, as well as difficulty to return to sports and to perform some tasks around the home. 

97The plaintiff's evidence is that he is still in pain and, as noted by Dr Myers, that he continued to suffer Complex Regional Pain. It is a condition for which the prognosis is poor. While the injury is not to the plaintiff's dominant right hand, the result is that he continues to be in pain and to take medication for this pain, as well as suffering from significant problems such as depression and mood swings. As Associated Professor Champion notes in his long and insightful report, these additional problems also include his becoming reliant upon Mersyndol Forte. In addition (and I note no objection was taken to this evidence), the plaintiff has gained approximately 15 kilograms, which has resulted in hypertension and a potential for type 2 diabetes, for which he is at high risk, as his mother suffered from that condition. This in turn places him at cardiovascular risk. These features appear not to have been present in Clarence Valley Council v MacPherson.

98I note reliance by the first defendant on comments about non-economic loss in Owners - Strata Plan 156 v Gray [2004] NSWCA 304, in relation to an ankle injury. This case is also referred to in Clarence Valley Council v MacPherson but, as their Honours point out at [73]-[74], this was an injury to which the plaintiff had significantly adjusted, in that she only had a short time off work.

99Taking all of the above into account, the more realistic assessment of non-economic loss is that proposed by the second defendant, who puts non-economic loss at 25%. Accordingly an allowance of $33,800 for non-economic loss is made.

Past and future out-of-pocket expenses

100Past out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed at $47,972.70 (T 213). There is an additional account from Dr Dara Chung for $858. The total of past out-of-pocket is therefore $48,830.70.

101The plaintiff claims future out-of-pocket expenses as follows:





Future Out-of-Pocket Expenses


(a) General Practitioner52 consultations per year at $66.00 per consultation




(b) Pharmaceutical at $35.00 per week




(c) Other at $10.00 per week




Total: $111.00 per week x 893.6 (multiplier)

$99,189.60

102The estimate I was provided with by the counsel for the second defendant set out the following for future out-of-pocket expenses:





Future Out-of-Pocket Expenses


Pharmaceuticals at $35 pw for (say) 10 years




Consultation rates at $66 for (say) 10 years




Or ($101 per week) (Multiplier 412.9)




Total

$41,702.90

103While the plaintiff's medical problems will require ongoing supervision, the likelihood that he will continue to attend the doctor weekly, or to spend $35 per week on pharmaceuticals in circumstances where his doctors want him to cut down on Mersyndol Forte seems unlikely. The estimate of $41,702.90 is a more realistic figure in that it takes into account the fact that the plaintiff's condition has largely stabilised, his medication will hopefully decrease, and his overall health issues can be supervised by his general practitioner rather than the specialist.

105The fact that the plaintiff has spent nearly half of the period of past economic loss in gaol creates some real difficulties, both for economic loss and past home assistance.

106In relation to past economic loss, the plaintiff claims that if he had stayed with Blue Collar he would have received $500 net per week. However, the first defendant tenders a schedule of the plaintiff's past earnings is as follows:





Financial Year Ending

Gross Earnings - Wages

Earnings - Benefits

Weekly Earnings


30 June 2004

$15,895.00

$8,933.00

$305.67

30 June 2007

$12,868.00

$1,568.00

$247.50

107The plaintiff's past economic loss to 20 September 2007, the date of his arrest, is $383 net per week for a period of 22.85 weeks. This adds up to $8,756.12. He remained in prison until 19 September 2009. His past loss of income therefore consists of the period the 22.85 weeks before he was imprisoned and the 129.15 weeks since his release from jail. In practical terms, since he was in jail for two years, it is unrealistic to claim sums of comparable earnings to his employment at Gate Gourmet. The amount which the first defendant submits is appropriate is $223 net per week, this being based on the plaintiff's previous earnings in the failed business conducted by his former colleague.

108I do not accept this submission. The issue is the plaintiff's capacity to work and its loss, rather than a lower salary for a particular period due to involvement in a failed business venture. The plaintiff did not receive a comparable wage for several years prior to accepting the job in which he was injured was because that business failed, but does not accurately reflect his earning loss. Accordingly, in this regard, I consider the most appropriate course is to assume he would have earned a week wage comparable to his earnings at Gate Gourmet and accordingly, I propose to award the past economic loss sought by the plaintiff of $71,773.27, plus superannuation at $7,895.06, plus Fox v Wood of $4,898.00.

Future economic loss

109Since his injury, the plaintiff has acquired a criminal record. The offence was a serious one. In addition, he has probation requirements and he has made admissions about drug use. I have heard his explanation, which is that he claimed to be a drug user whilst in prison in order to avoid being assaulted and that by claiming he was a drug addict, this is a factor in getting into a better jail:

""Q. Are you telling the Court that you were telling lies because you wanted to get to the best possible place in the
A. I wanted to get stronger. I tried to get down to welfare, because they were going to fax some sheets off to Stuart Myers and if they verified that I wasn't messing, I thought they were going to give them to me. Well then I went down there to fill the forms in because it takes about - once you've filled a form in it takes about six weeks for them to come back and see you. So I was in that much pain, I was just lying because I had to go and see first aid down there because I was just in too much pain sometimes.

KETTLE

Q. So for the purposes of the presentencing report with Daniel Llewellyn, you were lying, were you?
A. I don't remember, sir. As I just said to you, I don't remember it.

Q. The history that's recorded of your drug use by Daniel Llewellyn, is that you commenced cannabis on occasional basis at age 18 to 19 years of age with peers. Is that right or wrong?
A. That part is true, sir. That's true.

Q. And that you progressed to daily use in 1993, citing precipitation as a result of your brother's death. Is that right?
A. Because of the charge I was on. I just told you that before, sir. I was saying that because of the charge I was on.

Q. Sorry, you were?
A. I was saying that because of the charges I was on. That's what they said to me, ""If you say you're not a user in gaol and you're caught with drugs, well, they'll smash you,"" and I wasn't a user in gaol. I never took stuff in gaol, never, ever. I don't take drugs. I used to take - smoke a bit of pot and that's it. 

Q. The history goes on to say that you had a daily use of $20 per day and then you reported that you commenced speed five years ago, as in from 2003.
A. Sir, I don't know what I was saying to them - truthful with you, I don't.

Q. So is this history right or wrong, though?
A. I'd say it'd be right - be right but I just don't remember doing it, that's what I'm saying to you. I filled out - to be truthful with you, about 34 forms in to get down to - to get down to the hospital.

Q. After you commenced speed five years prior, you were taking speed on a daily basis by tablet form, spending up to $300 per week. Is that right?
A. No, sir. That's not right. I've never taken speed in my life.

Q. Well, you told Daniel Llewellyn that you'd taken
A. I just told you why I done it, sir. I just told you, to get to the hospital.

Q. You also told Daniel Llewellyn that you would gamble when under the influence of speed to get a quick quid to support your extended family and your drugusing habits. Is that right?
A. Probably, if it says it there.

Q. Sorry?
A. Probably, if it says it there.

Q. That's probably right, is it?
A. Probably right, sir. I don't remember doing it. I'm just saying I don't remember doing it. I don't

Q. You can't remember doing what?
A. See that report. That one there you've got in your hand.

Q. I'm asking you whether prior to your incarceration and being caught, you had a habit of using speed which required you to spend up to $300 a week.
A. I was just saying that. I just told you sir, I was just saying that. I told you why I said it because I'd never been in gaol in my life. They were telling me, ""Tell them you're on drugs because if you don't they will smash you, the force will smash you."" They take it as financial gain, that's why I said it.

Q. So who told you this, your coaccused? Is that right?
A. Yes, because I'd never been in gaol in my life. I've never done gaol in my life. I didn't know what to do, what to say, where to go, I didn't know who to ask for help. I was on me own. I didn't know what to do. I was just saying what they were telling me to say and I was saying it. 

Q. You also told Daniel Llewellyn that - you stated that, ""The drugs and money were not yours. However, you -"" and then this is in quotation marks - ""'participated in the scene' to earn some money to support your extended family and drug use."" 
A. I was desperate for money. I told you that, yes."" (T 108-110)

110Counsel were unable to provide me with assistance concerning the correct approach to take in relation to future economic loss where the plaintiff had committed a serious crime which had impacted upon his future earning capacity. That is not a criticism, but an indication of the lack of authority on this issue.There has, however, been some discussion of the question of failure to mitigate by the NSW Court of Appeal in relation to two motor accident cases. In Mahony v Watson [2003] NSWCA 259, the plaintiff was able to keep working following the accident but left his employer for unrelated reasons and made no attempt to obtain other employment. In addition, he was convicted of his fourth (mid-range) drink driving offence and lost his licence for a considerable period, which the defendant's rehabilitation expert claimed made it difficult for the plaintiff to obtain work as a painter. The Court of Appeal noted there was an earlier case where failure to mitigate had been found where there was refusal to seek work (Brogan v McGeary (1995) Aust Torts Reps 81-342), but held (at [54]) that a further drink-driving offence and refusal to seek work did not amount to failure to mitigate, and that that no reduction for mitigation should be made. In Arnott v Choy (2010) 56 MVR 390, the Court of Appeal (referring at [160] to Mahony v Watson), stated that it was possible to take into account the steps reasonably available to the injured person to find employment, taking into account his or her physical and emotional disabilities following the accident, although on the facts of the case (the plaintiff suffered serious head injuries) failure to mitigate was not made out. (The reference to Mahony v Watson at [160] is surprising, as it would appear to stand for the opposing view.) Both these decisions relate to the statutory provisions which applied to motor vehicle accidents, and are therefore of limited relevance. In the absence of clear indication from the Court of Appeal that matters such as committing a serious crime such as supplying drugs (for example, that a drug supply conviction might make it difficult to obtain work in places such as airports), I propose to deal with the impact of the plaintiff's criminal record on his future earning capacity with very great caution.

111The plaintiff has a long work history. However, that includes regular and long periods of unemployment, a history of casual employment, and, in relation to the four years prior to the accident, all of the above.

112However, the plaintiff intends to work, and has clear plans for return to the work force as a counsellor, following some further studies. He should be able to obtain full time employment of this kind. I also note other occupations referred to in the rehabilitation report, such as traffic management, in which the plaintiff has previous experience. The plaintiff's hand injury will not prevent him working in jobs of this kind, as this report points out.

113It is appropriate in the circumstances that a cushion should be awarded. The cushion of $50,000 proposed by the first defendant is too small. It the course of submissions, there was discussion of a cushion of $75,000. I consider this is a more appropriate amount and this is what I intend to order.

Past and future home care

114Prior to the plaintiff's injury, his wife would do the chores during the day, and he would help in the afternoon when he arrived home from work (T 65). His wife made the beds, did the washing and generally ran the house, but the plaintiff would do the cooking and cleaning as well as gardening tasks such as mowing (T 66). The car was washed at the car wash. The plaintiff thought he spent around 20 hours a week helping his wife, but the key concept is that he was helping his wife, and that she was primarily responsible, even though he considered he helped her ""heaps"" (T 67).

115The plaintiff was heavily dependant on his wife during the period following the accident. He could not drive, and his pain levels meant that he could not use his hand at all for much of the period between the time of the accident and 20 September, the date he entered prison. During this initial period of 22 weeks the plaintiff clearly needed significant help.

116The circumstances in which the plaintiff was incarcerated between 20 September 2007 and 19 September 2009 represents a real problem when determining past home care. The plaintiff's submissions put that 2 hours a day, 7 days a week for 150 weeks is appropriate. This is to cover the 22 weeks before imprisonment, plus the 128 weeks since his release. This is, however, an artificially constructed figure designed to deal with the problem that the plaintiff did not require home care for two years.

117After the plaintiff's release, he had difficulty performing tasks around the home. Dr Adler notes (15 November 2009) that the plaintiff had trouble holding or handling tools, crockery (such as a cup or glass) and other items he had previously used his right hand for, and was tending to do household chores one-armed. He was, however, able to do up his shoelaces, dress and shower himself, and perform some tasks around the home, such as vacuuming.

118Dr Adler recommends that the plaintiff receive 6 hours a week domestic assistance. He assessed general maintenance, gardening, car washing and other home repair work at 2 hours a fortnight ($35 per hour, which he says adds up to $1,250 per annum, although I note that this would in fact add up to $1,820) plus domestic assistance for household cleaning, laundry, vacuuming, tidying such as making beds and dusting (such as corners of ceilings) at 6 hours a week ($35 per hour, which is $10,920 per annum).

119According to the plaintiff he can now cut up meals. He copes with shoelace problems by wearing slip-on shoes (T 68). He helps around the house and tries to tidy up and vacuum.

120The problem is that his wife has a congenital illness which has developed fairly recently. She is now no longer working and has restrictions on her physical activities. Their daughter and husband now do the mowing. There is no documentary evidence of payment for past mowing, but I do not regard this as a significant problem. Building repairs are largely a matter for the landlord but the plaintiff and his wife have to keep the gutters and fences in good order.

121The first defendant submits that neither the plaintiff nor his wife have given evidence capable of raising the provision of gratuitous attendant care services relating to the injury, either past or future, to the thresholds envisaged by s 15 of the Act. The evidence does not support findings capable of meeting the threshold. 

122First of all, there is no evidence of voluntary care for 6 hours a week for a period of at least 6 consecutive months for the period up to 19 September 2009, by reason of the plaintiff entering prison 22 weeks after the accident, for a period of two years, where he had no home care at all. During this 22 week period, according to Ms Hammond's report, he had about 3.5 hours of help from his wife for about 8 weeks (page 61 of Exhibit 1).

123Secondly, for the period after his release, the evidence of the plaintiff is in conflict with Dr Adler, in that he said he does make beds (T 154), help set the table and with the washing up (T 155), vacuum and do other light housework. The report of Deborah Hammond (at pp. 13 - 14) helpfully sets this out and it is clear that while he is doing less, it does not amount to needing six hours a week of help for more than six months. I appreciate that the plaintiff and his wife gave estimates to the contrary, but these were of a very general nature and tended to fade away when specific times were sought.

124As to commercial care, in relation to both past and future care, I note that the test in Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353 at [18] and [24] has not been met.

125The claim for future care (7 hours a week at $35 per hour plus lawn mowing at $16 per week = $233,229.60) suffers from the same problems. No evidence was given of an likelihood of engaging commercial assistance after gratuitous services ceased. The lawn mowing now appears to be done by other family members. The plaintiff is in fact encouraged to ""aggressively"" (Dr Myers, 15 May 2007) increase the use of his hand, and the plaintiff continues to do hand strengthening exercises.

126Deborah Hammond's report for future nursing states:

""Mr Kemble is currently not performing gardening, lawn mowing, car washing or home maintenance activities. However, as noted above, Dr McGill (13/10/10) noted ""The advice provided by Dr Myers that he can use his hand normally without fear of doing harm is appropriate"". In light of this advice, Mr Kemble's appearance at assessment, and the fact that it is his non-dominant hand, it is the consultant's opinion that Mr Kemble should be encouraged to undertake the majority of these activities.

The consultant considers it reasonable for Mr Kemble to continue to avoid ladder climbing due to the requirement to maintain 3 points of contact for safety, until after the completion of his pain management program. As such, an allowance of 16 hours for assistance with ladder climbing spring cleaning activities, once off, is considered reasonable."" (page 16)

127The plaintiff is able to drive (although he drives an automatic car) and does not require any adaptive equipment.

128Finally, I note Dr Katafaris, in his report of 25 October 2011 notes that the plaintiff was trying to vacuum, wash and clean up and that the plaintiff had been advised by Dr Lam that if he did not use his hand it would worsen. Dr Myers, his treating surgeon, has not provided any report supporting a need for home assistance.

Conclusions concerning past and future home assistance 

129 Although the plaintiff suffered a significant injury to his hand, in circumstances approaching the threshold of six hours a week, he was arrested and imprisoned before he received assistance for six months. He remained in gaol for two years. When he came out of gaol, he was able to look after himself sufficiently well to be able to perform many of the tasks he could perform before his injury. 

130As to the future, there is evidence, although unsupported by documentary proof, that the plaintiff has had to pay for lawn mowing. The defendants put before me two competing sums for future commercial care, if I accept that the plaintiff needs assistance with mowing, on the basis that he has paid for this in the past. The sums proposed are $10,554 (16 hours per annum ($38.50 per hour) or $616 per annum or $12 per week for life (879.5) and $8,235.34 ($35 per hour, one hour each 3 weeks ($11.70) deferred for 5 years). There is very little difference between these sums so I propose to accept the slightly higher figure of $10,554.

131Accordingly, past home care is nil, and future commercial care is $10,554.

132The plaintiff's damages are as follows:





Non-economic loss

$33,800.00

$48,830.70

133This brings me to the issue of apportionment of damages between the defendants.

Apportionment between the defendants

134Cross-claims have been filed in these proceedings as follows:

(a)Gate Gourmet, by way of cross-claim filed in court on 7 March 2012, brings a claim pursuant to s 5 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW), and further states that the duty owed by Blue Collar was non-delegable;

(b)Blue Collar, by cross-claim filed in court on 7 March 2012, pleads reliance upon s 5.

135The defence filed by Blue Collar on 19 August 2011 admits (in paragraph 2) that it conducted the business of labour-hire involving the provision of the plaintiff to Gate Gourmet and (paragraph 4) that Gate Gourmet had agreed with Blue Collar for the plaintiff to perform duties as a storeman/forklift driver under the direction of and control of Gate Gourmet at Gate Gourmet's premises in Mascot.

136Gate Gourmet's plea is that if (which is denied) the plaintiff is awarded damages, such damages should be reduced by application of s 151Z(2) Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) to reflect Gate Gourmet's reduced entitlement to contribution from the employer (paragraph 8).

137The principles of operation of s 151Z(2) require the court to reduce the amount payable to the plaintiff in relation to the percentage payable in relation to the liability of the employer as follows. In other words, the damages are reduced by the amount which is the difference between the amount the court finds would have been recoverable from the employer (pursuant to s 5) if the whole of the verdict is calculated in accordance with the principles applicable to assessment of damages for Gate Gourmet (pursuant to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)) and the amount which would be recovered if the verdict was calculated in accordance with the provisions of Division 3 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW). The question is the degree to which, if Gate Gourmet is found to be negligent, what should be the percentage representing the relative culpability and causative potency of Blue Collar, as opposed to Gate Gourmet. This involves a consideration of the particulars of negligence set out in the amended statement of claim.

138The principles are helpfully set out by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie (2003) 65 NSWLR 1. While the factual issues vary from case to case (in TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie the relevant issues are set out at [13]), but the approach remains the same. This is particularly the case where the plaintiff's injury has occurred in the increasing common situation of a manpower labour supply of its workers to another employer. In TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie, the trial judge assessed proportionate responsibility at 50/50%

139The first defendant submits that, if Gate Gourmet is found negligent, then the relative culpability and causative potency of Blue Collar's actions, as the employer of the plaintiff, was in the order of 30%. 

140The particulars of negligence in relation to the second defendant include failing to exercise care by undertaking an inspection of the workplace, particularly with regard to the safety or suitability of the workplace, and failing to review the premises including the cool room area with respect to the suitability of areas such as the cool room area. The failure to inspect the plant and equipment, and to ensure the plaintiff was provided with any or adequate assistance is also relied upon (see particulars (a)-(i) set out in paragraph 5 of this judgment). These are all omissions, it is asserted, referrable to the employer. 

141However, the first defendant submits that the evidence made it clear that the plaintiff was not the only Blue Collar employee sent to work at the premises of Gate Gourmet. As Exhibit 1 showed (see page 74 for the entry on 1 April 2007), Blue Collar recorded their employees' attendance at Gate Gourmet, and appears to have had around 15 of its labour-hire employees on secondment to Gate Gourmet at the time of the accident. The plaintiff's uniform consisted of a barge with his name and photograph and the words ""Blue Collar"" on it. In addition, Blue Collar provided him with a safety vest (T 77).

142A young lady named ""Vivian"", who came to see the plaintiff at Gate Gourmet after the accident, appears to have been available if the plaintiff had any problems (T 77). This suggests, the first defendant submits, that Blue Collar had plenty of opportunity both to inspect the premises and to have input into the conditions under which its employees worked. Blue Collar should, as well as would, have known the nature of the duties to be carried out by the plaintiff and would have been well aware of the safety implications of issues such as faulty equipment.

143I do not accept these submissions. The plaintiff was working five days a week and received instructions on a daily basis from the leading hand and supervisor employed by Gate Gourmet. Most importantly, he used their equipment. Gate Gourmet treated him in the same way that they would treat any of their employees, in that they were exercising control over his day to day work activities and his hours. It was to Gate Gourmet that the plaintiff complained about the state of the trolleys, and it was the Gate Gourmet staff who had not only the obligations to take reasonable care to eliminate risks, but who were tasked with responding to complaints about inadequate or dangerous machinery.

144Counsel for the second defendant submitted that the evidence of the plaintiff that when he did complain he was told to stop ""whinging"" about the trolleys and get on with his job elevates culpability well beyond the normal, as this was a blatant dismissal of a problem being brought to their attention by a worker. In Maricic v Dalma Formwork (Australia) Pty Ltd at [74]-[75], the court noted that liability of an employer must be assessed on the facts of each case, but that a high percentage was appropriate where the labour-hire company also supply the plaintiff supervisor, as was the case in Maricic v Dalma Formwork (Australia) Pty Ltd. In the present case, that did not occur. J Blackwood & Son Ltd v Skilled Engineering Ltd [2008] NSWCA 142 was a similar case, in that the labour-hire company supplied a supervisor who was not only present on a daily basis, but the means of contact between the labour-hire company and the occupier. In those circumstances an apportionment of 30% was upheld.

145In TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie, where these features were not present, liability of the employer was fixed at 20%. Mr Robertson for the second defendant submitted that what he called ""the norm"" is about 20%.

146In the present case, I accept the submissions of the second defendant that the apportionment should be 90/10%. I agree with the submissions of Mr Robertson that the circumstances in which the plaintiff's complaints were treated so dismissively, and where not only the trolley which injured the plaintiff, but other trolleys, were in a poor state of condition and known by the first defendant's employees to be in this condition, the facts of this case are at the highest end of the scale. According to the plaintiff, Sonny had actual knowledge that this trolley was faulty and should not have been in use. In addition, there does not appear to have been anything other than the most haphazard system of repairs of faulty equipments. According to the plaintiff, the maintenance area was full of broken trolleys and there does not appear to have been any actual maintenance of the equipment going on. This is mismanagement and negligence of a very high order, and the first defendant's submissions to the contrary are not helped by the first defendant's continued failure to respond to subpoenae and notices to produce during the trial.

147I accordingly apportion the contribution of Gate Gourmet towards the damages award to 90%, and the contribution of Blue Collar to be 10%. I note the first defendant's submissions concerning the operation of s 151Z(2) Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) in relation to the difference between the amount of 10% which is recoverable from Blue Collar pursuant to s 5 of the Act (written submissions, paragraph 5).

148The defendants have offered to agree upon the sums payable to the plaintiff once I have determined the apportionment of the damages between them. I have accordingly included in my orders a provision for the parties to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the mathematically agreed amounts payable to the plaintiff by way of damages. The defendants have not addressed me in relation to any consequential orders concerning the apportionment of costs. I have granted liberty to apply in this regard also.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $294,453.93.

(2)Pursuant to s 5 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW), liability for payment of the judgment sum be apportioned 90% against the first defendant and 10% against the second defendant.

(3)The defendants' cross-claims otherwise dismissed.

(4)The parties are to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the amounts payable by each of the first and second defendant in accordance with my findings as to apportionment of liability between them.

(5)Defendants to pay the plaintiff's costs.

(6)Liberty to apply, and to restore the matter for any application concerning costs, including any request by the defendants to apportion costs as between the defendants and/or in relation to the order for costs in favour of the plaintiff.

(7)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		01 May 2012",2012-04-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708312,Cooper v Mulcahy [2012] NSWSC 373,"Judgment

1This is the hearing of the plaintiff's claim for an adjustment of the parties' property interests pursuant to the Property (Relationships) Act 1984. The defendant brings a cross claim seeking such an adjustment and also damages, aggravated and exemplary damages in respect of a series of alleged assaults perpetrated on her by the plaintiff.

2The parties lived in a de facto relationship between about November 1992 until September 2007. There is some difference between the parties about the precise dates. The parties had no children as a result of their relationship but they each had children from children from their marriages before they commenced their relationship. The defendant's children resided with the parties for a short time after the commencement of the relationship.

History of the relationship

3The plaintiff was born in 1957 and the defendant in 1951. 

4The relationship between the parties commenced when the plaintiff moved into the defendant's home in the Brisbane suburb of Gaythorne. The parties differ as to when this occurred. The plaintiff says that occurred in October 1991 and the defendant suggests that it occurred in November 1992. In the context of this case the difference is not material. However given the plaintiff's difficulty with dates and other evidence I will accept that it commenced in November 1992.

5At the time of the commencement of the relationship the plaintiff was working for a company roof shield in Brisbane. He was a divorced man with three children who were then living with their mother. At the time of the commencement of the relationship the defendant was unemployed and in receipt of the sole parent pension. She had two children Wade aged 16 and David aged 20. At the time of the commencement of the relationship they were both residing in her mother's house but David moved out shortly after the relationship commenced.

6In either 1992 or 1993 the plaintiff moved to Melbourne to conduct a roof shield franchise in the city. Initially the defendant did not join him but did so some months later. While in Melbourne the defendant did not work and continued to receive social security benefits. During this period she let out her property, which she owned, at Gaythorne, Brisbane. In 1994 the parties returned to Brisbane and moved into the defendant's home. The plaintiff continued to conduct a roof restoration business in his own name. This business ended when the plaintiff suffered a work injury and went on to sickness benefits.

7In November 1995 the parties moved to the Sunshine coast for approximately 7 months and the plaintiff was involved in the ""Wetcheck"" business. In 1996 the parties commenced travelling around Australia, which to one extent or another they did until 2000. This involved the parties selling a range of products at field days and trade shows including welding rods, sunglasses, hats and the like. Both parties participated in the work involved although there are some differences between them as to the extent of each person's involvement.

8From 2000 the parties in effect became property investors. They spent considerable amounts of time developing properties they purchased during the relationship. Initially in 1999 these were the properties at Coldstream Street, Yamba and at South Bank Road (sometimes also referred to as Serpentine Road) at Harwood in New South Wales. Later in 2003 an adjoining property to this was purchased and the overall parcel of land was developed. Also in 2003 the parties purchased a block of units in South Grafton that was later sold in 2007 for a significant profit. The properties bought and sold by the parties are set out later in this judgment.

9In 2006 the parties became involved in a telephone business. The parties jointly hold 50% in the company Janmel Pty Ltd, the owner of this business, but it was the plaintiff who was the primary involved party, if not almost exclusively, as between himself and the defendant. This position continued post separation. 

10The date of separation of the parties was September 2007, which is admitted on the pleadings and was the date of physical separation. However there appears to be a period of emotional interaction up until May 2008 and on the plaintiff's version August 2008. Between September 2007 and May 2008 the parties went to Bribie Island together, the plaintiff visited the defendant at Mitchelton, staying overnight and the parties had a holiday in Vanuatu in December 2007. 

11After separation the plaintiff continued to live in the property for some time at South Bank Road and looked after the farm. He no longer lives there.

12The factors which the Court must consider are set out in Section 20 of the Property Relationship Act 1984 as discussed by Basten JA in Baker v Towle [2008] NSWCA 73, 

""[43] It has been said in a number of cases that the application of s 20 involves three steps, which were identified in Howlett v Neilson [2005] NSWCA 149 (Hodgson JA, Ipp and McColl JJA agreeing) in the following terms at [25]: 
(1) identification and valuation of the property of the parties;
(2) identification and valuation of the respective contributions of the parties, of the types referred to in s 20;
(3) determination of what if any order is just and equitable having regard to these contributions.
[44] What questions arise will, of course, depend to some extent on the circumstances of the individual case. For example, in some cases there will be an antecedent question as to whether the applicant is a party to a ""domestic relationship"" as defined in s 5 of the Act: see, eg, Delany v Burgess [2007] NSWCA 360. Otherwise, each of the three steps referred to above may require some further elucidation.

13I will first deal with the parties' property at the commencement and conclusion of the relationship.

Property of the parties at the commencement of the relationship

14The plaintiff's assets consisted of:


Savings of $6,000 
Vehicle worth $1,000 
Trade debts of $4,000

15The defendant's property consisted of:


Her property at Gaythorne estimated to have a value of $150,000 
Her household goods estimated at $15,000 
Bank accounts and cash of $900

16She had debts of $33,000.

17Her income consisted of social security benefits of $407 per fortnight and board from her son Wade of $50 per week.

Property of the parties at the conclusion of the relationship

19The real estate held at the conclusion of the relationship was the following


The jointly owned home at South Bank Road 
The jointly owned cane farm at South Bank Road 
50% interest in River Road which the defendant owned with her son Wade, 
The jointly owned removal house 
The defendant's home at Gaythorne

20There was personal property that is best dealt with when considering those assets at the hearing. There are bank accounts that can also be conveniently dealt with at that time. The house at South Bank Road was valued at $425,000 at separation and the Cane Farm at $550,000. The evidence did not address the value of the other real estate at the conclusion of the relationship.

21There were liabilities to the ANZ for a line of credit of $406,855.66, a loan on the farm of $394,803.76 and a half share of the loan on River Road of $65,000. The removal house was sold in October 2007 and the proceeds of $415,000 paid to reduce the line of credit and loan.

Property of the parties at the hearing

22The defendant sold her home at Gaythorne in January 2008 for $565,000. She kept the net proceeds so it is necessary to determine what is the appropriate add-back to ascertain the property of the parties at the hearing. There should be deducted from the net sale proceeds of $533,000 (which was arrived at by deducting the mortgage of $32,000 from the sale price of $565,000) further amounts to reflect the costs incurred in subdividing that land and fixing up the property to maximise its sale potential. Those costs amount to $43,000, which results in this amount being reduced to $490,000. There were legal fees of $13,552, which relate to the purchase of Mitchelton and they should not be deducted. The defendant also seeks to deduct her living expenses of $69,000 relying on the following passage from Marker v Marker (1998) FamCA 42:

""There seems to be no appropriate basis for notionally adding back moneys that existed at separation but which have been subsequently spent on meeting reasonably incurred necessary living expenses. Neither the Family Law Act nor the case law require that parties go into a state of suspended economic animation once their marriage breaks down pending the resolution of their financial arrangements. Parties are entitled to continue to provide for their own support. Whether any expenditure so incurred is reasonable or extravagant is a matter that can be determined by the trial Judge. ""

23There is nothing to suggest that the expenditure was excessive so this allowance should be made. The defendant also suggested that the add back should be reduced to reflect the use to which the property was put in acquiring subsequent properties. That is better taken into account when dealing with the adjustment process. The amount of the add back is $421,000.

24This sale was part of a rearrangement of her family's properties which, unbeknown to the plaintiff, the defendant commenced prior to separation. In particular the evidence shows that in August 2007, the Gaythorne property was mortgaged to the Bendigo Bank and a substantial portion of the mortgage funds in the sum of approx. $500,000 were made available to the defendant's son, David, who then used those funds to assist in the purchase of another property of his own. This was done by selling the Mitchelton property owned by the defendant's son to the Mulcahy Family Trust in which the defendant maintains an interest along with both her sons. The Mulcahy Family Trust was approved for 2 loan facilities with limits of $560,000 and $80,000 respectively, both secured against the Gaythorne property, held solely in the name of the defendant and the Mitchelton property (to be purchased). The ""purchase"" monies in the sum of approx. $420,000 were raised by the Mulcahy Family Trust by drawing on the larger of the loan facilities. The recipient of those funds was the vendor of the Mitchelton property, which was the defendant's son, who then used those funds along with a further $80,000 drawn by the Mulcahy Family Trust on the second facility to purchase a further property for him. 

25The facility of $80,000 was repaid to the Bendigo Bank by the defendant's son after settlement of the purchase of his other property. Once the Gaythorne property had been sold in January 2008 some 5 months later, the proceeds of sale were used to pay out the loan facility that had been used primarily for the purchase of Mitchelton and the balance owed on that facility was reduced to $693.18. Subsequently, the defendant and her sons used that loan facility for their personal benefit and it was drawn back down to its maximum limit of $560,000 by April 2010. This included payments totalling more than $200,000 to the defendant's solicitors. 

26In October 2007 the plaintiff transferred $250,000 from the joint CBA account into an account in his own name. The plaintiff gave evidence that he was concerned to protect the property of the parties because he had become aware of new access to Internet banking by the defendant and a significant deposit of $250,000 had disappeared from his Internet banking accounts. In fact it had not disappeared from his accounts. He took steps to transfer that $250,000 into a net saver account in his sole name. He placed a ""both to sign order"" on the joint Equity Manager account (credit facility) after transferring $50,000 from that account to an account in his sole name. These amounts reflect in his present assets and thus there should n add-back of $300,000 to ascertain the properties of the parties at the date of the hearing. Given the lack of cross-examination of the defendant on this issue it is quite clear that he mislead the defendant by telling her the $250,000 had been put into a joint account when she challenged him on the matter.

28The defendant's position throws up the following differences between the parties.

(1)The add back for Gaythorne which I determine at $421,000. 

(2)Operating account. Plaintiff $24,255 defendant $26,064. In the absence of any proper explanation for the difference between the parties as to the ANZ joint operating account, I will adopt the lower figure of $24,255.

(3)Netsaver account. The parties are agreed as to the present balance of $10,280. There is no agreement as to whether recent reductions were for joint expenses or simply personal payments for the plaintiff. The amount in the Netsaver bank account as at 1 July 2011 was $78,230. Given the agreement as to the present balance of $10,280 I will use that figure in the absence of evidence as to the purposes of the reduction.

(4)Janmell loan. Plaintiff Nil defendant $73,692 plus interest of $17,153.07. Having regard to the affidavit evidence of the plaintiff I will adopt his figures for the Janmell loans and monies owed for use of joint funds.

(5)Monies owed by plaintiff for use of joint funds. Plaintiff $4,700 defendant $165,612.81. Having regard to the affidavit evidence of the plaintiff I will adopt his figures for the Janmell loans and monies owed for use of joint funds.

(6)Ace High Hats. Plaintiff $9,000, defendant nil. Given the passage of time I will adopt the defendant's value of the Ace High Hats.

(7)Add back by Plaintiff for $250,000 and $50,000. 

(8)Mortgage on River road. This was paid out by the Mulchay family trust on 17 January 2008. 

29Given that the defendant does not give a credit for interest on her add back it is inappropriate to require the plaintiff to give a credit for interest on his add back.

30The plaintiff filed a detailed affidavit dated 2 September 2011 as a result of a direction made by the Court on 10 August 2011 to explain the situation with respect to bank accounts and use of funds. There has been no response or cross-examination on this material and the differences claimed by the defendant, to which I have referred, are not explained in her submissions.

31With the net assets of $1,380,782 less $487,000, being the plaintiff's figure for the addback of Gaythorne, less $9,000 being the plaintiff's figure for the Ace High hat stock plus add backs of $721,000 (from (1) and (7) above) this makes a pool of $1,605,782. 

The Lotto win

32It is the plaintiff's submission that the assets to be considered for division should not include his conceded interest of $15 million being the result of the winning lotto ticket of his now wife, Susan Cooper, formerly Borrett. In August 2010 Mrs Cooper bought a ticket in Ozlotto at a newsagent and the next day returned to the newsagent to be told she had the winning ticket and that she had won $30 million.

33The Plaintiff submits that asset should be quarantined and not be considered as part of the available assets for adjustment pursuant to s20 of the Act. It was submitted that there were a number of reasons for this, including:


There is no contribution of any kind by the defendant to that asset; 
The asset came to be three years after the date asserted by the defendant as the date of separation; 
The asset came to be through the good fortune of the plaintiff's then partner purchasing the lotto ticket; 
The contributions of the defendant are able to be properly recognised from the other assets of the parties; 
The fact that under the Act there is no equivalent to s75(2) of the Family Law Act 1975 to make further adjustments based on a party's future needs and means.

34The defendant submits that the plaintiff's entitlement/benefit, direct and indirect/enrichment in respect of the proceeds are relevant in at least these ways:-

(a)In determining on the particular facts of this case what is just and equitable adjustment of the parties' interests in the asset pool as constituted at the date of trial. 

(b)In assessing exemplary damages against the plaintiff in the tort claim.

(c)The form of orders as regards adjustment by ""cash or assets"".

35At this stage I will deal with the first of these submissions. The plaintiff's submissions dealt with the well-known cases that dealt with inherited properties as well as Lottery wins. An important case is Wallace v Stanford (1997) 37 NSWLR 1. The majority included Mahoney JA whose decision was later approved of in Evans v Marmont (1992) 42 NSWLR 70. An issue in Wallace v Stanford was how to deal with an inheritance received by one party. The inheritance was received by Mr Stanford following the death of his mother in 1984 and the parties separated in 1987. The evidence of the value of the property was that in 1989 it was worth $175,000 and at the date of trial it was worth $300,000.

36At page 15 of the decision in Wallace v Stanford, Mahoney JA expressed the view in relation to property inherited by Mr Stanford that Ms Wallace ""is not entitled to have or to have value from that property merely because Mr Stanford acquired it"". Mahoney JA went on to test the proposition in the following way:

""Assume that a woman has by a lottery win acquired $1,000,000 the day before or the day after separation from a de facto relationship: what if any account is to be taken of that fact? There is in such a case no contribution to that sum by the other party to the relationship (I put aside special cases such as joint ownership of the money used to buy the lottery ticket or joint ownership of the ticket). Accordingly the Court may order part of the woman's winning to go to the man's benefit only if the fact that she has those winnings makes it ""just and equitable"" to give part of them to him. In my opinion the fact that she has such monies is not as such a ground for making an order which otherwise the Court would not have made. The winnings are a windfall which has no relationship to the exercise of the Court's discretion""

37The plaintiff submitted that the determination of what is just and equitable is informed by the consideration of the contributions made by the parties to the assets. The plaintiff relies on the views expressed by Mahoney JA and which were approved by the five-member bench in Evans v Marmont. The plaintiff notes that the paragraph that followed the above passage of Mahoney JA's judgment includes the following:

""This does not mean that the fact that a woman when the order comes to be made is richer rather than poorer cannot affect the order to be made. In some cases it may. Thus one party may deserve to have an order but no order can be made because the other party has no property which can be adjusted to provide it. The Court may determine not to do what may be futile"". 

38The plaintiff submitted that what was being said by Mahoney JA in these passages was that an adjustment that might be made to other assets of the parties as a result of a windfall gain would only occur if the non winning party had made relevant contributions to the other assets to such an extent as to justify such an order. 

39The defendant acknowledged in its submissions the authoritative nature of the pronouncement of Mahoney JA in Wallace v Stanford (1995) 35 NSWLR 1 that a party is not entitled to have or to have value from inherited property (a fortiori proceeds of a lottery win) merely because the other party has acquired it and, it further conceded, congruent with the judgment of Mahoney JA, that an adjustment may be made to the division of the asset pool (not including lottery winnings) that might or would not otherwise have been made but for the enrichment of one of the parties by that ""windfall"".

40The defendant joined issue with the plaintiff's conclusions. It submitted that this proposition ignores for example, consideration of homemaker contributions and conduct rendering such contributions arduous of provision by the maltreated spouse. It also was submitted that it ignores individual or peculiar facts of each case:

""In this present case for example the desire of each party, especially Ms Mulcahy to build assets to provide homes for their respective children which drove her endeavours and from which Cooper benefited - all his aspirations of this type are met by windfall, whilst Ms Mulcahy's are thwarted to such extent that her children must now support her.""

41It is important in considering this matter to remember what was said by Gleeson CJ and McLelland CJ in Eq in Evans v Marmont at 70F through to 80A is the following:

""There is nothing in Section 20 of the Act of the kind found in Section 75(2)(o) of the Family Law Act which requires or entitles the Court to take into account as a factor alongside those referred to in par (a) and par (b) any fact or circumstance which in the opinion of the Court the justice of the case requires to be taken into account.

Most importantly Section 20 specifies in par (a) and par (b) the matters to which the Court is to have regard. As I have pointed out above, those matters would ordinarily have to be considered and a judgement as to what is just and equitable having regard to those matters will ordinarily have to be made, in a context, and that context may well include factors of the kind referred to by Hodgson J at first instance in Dwyer v Kaljo. However par (a) and par (b) prescribe the focal points by reference to which the discretionary judgment as to what seems just and equitable must be made. They are not merely two matters, or groups of matters which take their place amongst any relevant considerations. It is by having regard to those matters that the Court may adjust property interest in a just and equitable manner"".

42I also note the useful discussion by Bryson JA in Chanter v Catts 64 NSWLR 366, [2005] NSWCA 411 where he said the following at [65-67]:

65] The discretion while wide is not unlimited; the perception of what is just and equitable relates to the contributions referred to in paras (a) and (b) and not to some other or wider view of just and equitable adjustment of interests in property: see Evans v Marmont (1997) 42 NSWLR 70 ; 21 Fam LR 760 per Gleeson CJ and McLelland CJ in Eq, approving views of Mahoney JA in the majority in Wallace v Stanford (1995) 37 NSWLR 1 ; 19 Fam LR 430 and in the minority in Dwyer v Kaljo (1992) 27 NSWLR 728 ; 15 Fam LR 645 and in turn substantially approving the views of Hodgson J at first instance in Dwyer v Kaljo (1987) 11 Fam LR 785 at 793. It should I think be understood that in Evans v Marmont Meagher JA, at NSWLR 98; Fam LR 786-7, agreed with this part of the judgment of Gleeson CJ and McLelland CJ in Eq.


[66] What I understand to be established by the majority view in Evans v Marmont is to this effect:

(a) The factors referred to in paras (a) and (b) of s 21 are fundamental factors influencing the judgment of the court.
(b) Considering contributions and nothing else cannot lead to any view on what is just and equitable in the circumstances.
(c) Factors other than contributions can have no independent bearing on what is just and equitable: they have only such relevance as they may have to the question: what is just and equitable having regard to the contributions of the parties?
(d) Factors other than contributions mentioned in s 20(1)(a) and (b) may be relevant to answer the question whether the contributions of one party have been sufficiently compensated.
(e) The financial circumstances of the parties are relevant to ascertain the property of the parties at the time of the hearing, to which any adjustments of interest are to be made.
(f) The needs and means of the parties have general relevance as subsidiary factors to the question of what is just and equitable having regard to the contributions of parties; but otherwise the needs and means of the parties have no relevance, and a disproportion in their assets is not a reason why it is just and equitable to make an adjustment.
(g) It would be unrealistic to attempt to evaluate contributions of the kinds referred to in s 20(1)(a) and (b) for the purpose of determining what is just and equitable having regard to those contributions in isolation from the nature and incidents of the relationship as a whole.
(h) Often it may be found that contributions of the kind referred to in s 20(1)(b) would involve shared activities or reciprocal benefits which do not give rise to any disproportionate burden which it would be just and equitable to satisfy by an adjustment of interests in property.

[67] Notwithstanding the strength of the dissenting judgments of Mason P and Priestley JA in Evans v Marmont, the course of judicial opinion leading to Evans v Marmont means, in my view, that earlier judicial consideration, including consideration in the Court of Appeal, of the significance of contributions in s 20(1) should not be treated as authoritative; this observation extends not only to Dwyer v Kaljo but also to Green v Robinson (1995) 36 NSWLR 96 ; 18 Fam LR 594 and Theodoropoulos v Theodosiou (1995) 38 NSWLR 424 ; 19 Fam LR 632. The history of diversity of opinion, two refusals of special leave to appeal to the High Court and convening a Court of Appeal of five members gives the majority decision in Evans v Marmont a special claim to authority. In particular, expressions of opinion in Green v Robinson no longer govern the application of s 20(1). I do not find any clear majority expression of view in Green v Robinson.


43There are many other cases on lottery wins a number of which I have collected in Senno v Bailey [2011] NSWSC 679. The asset in this case only came into existence three years after the conclusion of the relationship and had nothing to do with the defendant. The defendant made no contributions to it and in my view it is not appropriate to take account of it in the adjustment process.

Financial contributions to the relationship

44The evidence of the plaintiff's earnings as disclosed in his tax returns is:


1991/92 - taxable income $17,118, tax $2,691 - $270 net per week. 
1992/93 - taxable income $23,365, tax $6,441 - $326 net per week. 
1993/94 - taxable income $3,614, tax nil - $70 net per week. 
1994/95 - taxable income $20,978, tax $4922 - $309 net per week.

45It was suggested that these returns do not truly reflect his earnings given deductions such as depreciation and expenditure and travelling expenses which were for the parties' personal benefit. This led to an analysis of these aspects in the returns which showed:


for the year 1991/92 there was no depreciation and no travelling and living expenses, 
for the year 1992/93 there was no depreciation and no travelling and living expenses, 
for the year 1993/94 there was $139 for depreciation and $6,958 for travelling and living expenses, 
for the year 1994/95 depreciation was $115 and travelling and living expenses were $1,000, 
for the year 1995/96 depreciation was $116 and travelling and living expenses were $893,
for the year 1996/97 depreciation not applicable, travelling and living expenses not applicable,

for the year 1997/98 not known, 
for the year 1998/99 depreciation $717, travelling and living expenses $123, 
for the year 1999/2000 depreciation $205, travelling and living expenses $1,488, 
for the year 2000/01 depreciation $2,288, travelling and living expenses $996, 
for the year 2001/02 depreciation $938, travelling and living expenses $1,324, 
for the year 2002/03 depreciation $1,638, travelling and living expenses $1,988, 
for the year 2003/04 depreciation $16 and travelling and living expenses nil, 
for the year 2004/05 depreciation $2,116 and travelling and living expenses nil, 
for the year 2005/06 depreciation $2,815, travelling and living expenses nil.

46Plainly there is little force in this submission and the plaintiff's earnings on the evidence available were quite low.

47The only evidence of the defendant's income is as follows:

(a) In 1991 her sole parent pension was $407 per fortnight.

(b) In August 1993 her pension was $312.51 per fortnight and for the period 14 December 1992 to 30 June 1993 it was $4,963.60.

(c) In March 1994 her carer's pension was cancelled and she received a Newstart allowance of $286.40 per fortnight.

48What happened to the pension after this does not seem to be the subject of evidence. When the parties brought their tax affairs up to date in 2006 and 2007 there were accounts prepared which showed them each sharing equally in the profits from their businesses and rentals.

49Plainly the parties received rental income and also capital profits from their investments.

50The rental income from Grafton was first declared in the 2003/04 tax return accounts when $26,945 was declared and for the first time the Yamba rent was declared at $3,950 in the same return. The plaintiff's tax returns did not declare any income from the Yamba property until that year.

51In the accounts for the year ending 30 June 2005 the Grafton rent was declared at $61,914 and rent from Yamba at $513. In the 2005/06 accounts the Grafton rent was declared at $58,471 and rent from Yamba nil.

52From the table at [18] above the capital profits (on the basis of purchase and sale price) were:

Coldstream street $292,500 in July 2004 
Oak avenue $61,500 in September 2003 
Grafton $359,000 in August 2007 
Part of farm $288,000 approx. in 2007

53Such figures take no account of borrowings or expenses but at least illustrate a source of continuing funds to support the parties.

Non-financial contributions to the relationship

54Before I consider the nature of the homemaker contributions in this matter I will first deal with the various assaults alleged in this case.

55In summary the various alleged assaults appear to be the following:


Use of abusive language from 1993 in these terms (in Paras 117 & 211 of the defendant's affidavit)

""All you Mulcahys are selfish. You've got no idea how to fucking live or behave"" and
""You're a private school overeducated cunt"" 
""You've all got a holier than thou attitude. The holy fucking Mulcahy trinity need a fucking smack in the fucking mouth"". 

He would also say to me on hundreds of occasions ""If you were a bloke I'd fucking knock your head in"". He would also say to me on many occasions ""Someone should give you a fucking smack in the mouth"". On other occasions he would say to me ""I should smack your fucking head in"" or ""I should give you a fucking smack in the mouth"". 



Arguments in 1993 about the parties relationships with their children (in paras 126 and 127) including abuse in these terms:
including ""you're a miserable, selfish bitch. You have your children. What about giving me time and space with mine."" 


In June 1995 the plaintiff, after the defendant asked when a shed in the back yard was going to be completed, grabbed her by the arm, dragged her down the back stairs to the yard where the unassembled shed lay and abused her in these terms (in para 206):

Bob: ""What the fuck to do you call that? [indicating towards the disassembled shed]
Me: The shed's not for me or Station Ave, it's purely for Wetcheck's storage.
Bob: I can't fuckin' stand the sound of your fuckin' voice or the fuckin' sight of you. Get out of my fuckin' sight. Disappear. If you don't, I'll fuckin' kill you. I'm fuckin' out of here. I'm going to pack my stuff and find somewhere else to live. Don't come back till I'm gone. I promise you I'll fuckin' kill you.""


In late 1996 in a burst of anger ordered the defendant out of the property at Maroochydore in these terms (in para 237):

""Get out of my fucking place. I'll get a fucking flat bed truck and pitch your fucking gear over the fucking balcony"". 


In late 1996 ordered the defendant out of the bed and took her back to her house at Gaythorne. (Para 238) 
In late December 2000 after a discussion about helping the plaintiff's son Trevor buy a property, which the defendant resisted, the plaintiff threatened to shoot either himself or the defendant. He became very angry and tipped a beer over the defendant. (Para 312 tx 319). During it he said:

""This is driving me fucking nuts, I really should get rid of the rifles. I am either going to shoot you or shoot myself or both of us.""


A few days after Christmas 2000 he complained to the defendant in these terms: (304)

""I've had to move furniture downstairs at Gaythorne and pack up the tool room, and I had to get Shane to help me - it's not my responsibility to do this shit. I've also left the key with the tenant. The fucking Mulcahys all fucking need a fucking smack in the fucking mouth"".


The threat to shoot was repeated in mid 2007 
On 18 February 2008 during an attempt at reconciliation the plaintiff suddenly burst out with (at para 582):

""All our successes have been due to me. All our failures are due to the fucking miserable Mulcahys ... Your bloody boys in particular.
I could easily destroy David's business. All it would take is one phone call. 
I could easily get that general manager's position Wade is applying for at Dimension Data. I could get that job over Wade without doubt ... piece of piss! 
I could destroy them. I know people who could seriously hurt them, the fucking miserable arrogant bastards.
That fucking David should have his fucking lips cut off, with that fucking arrogant smirk.
I ought to break both their legs.
It just takes one phone call to destroy their prospects. Cunts!
I've had many conversations with David's staff. I know what they really think of him.
David and Wade are only using you. Once they've got what they want from you, they'll ditch you.
The reason we're in this fucking mess is because of your fucking kids.""


On 6 may 2008 the plaintiff to the knowledge of the defendant was to receive the results of medical tests. The defendant did not ring up to enquire about the results so the plaintiff rang and said repeatedly (in para 597):

""Cunt....cunt... cunt... you miserable selfish fucking cunt""

56I will deal with the factual disputes in respect of the alleged assaults first and then turn to the effect on the defendant of those assaults. In general I note that the defendant gave extensive evidence on the effect of the incidents upon her. It will then be necessary to consider the application of the medical evidence in respect of the running of any time bar pursuant to the Limitation Act 1969 so far as it concerns the defendant's cross claim for assault.

57This requires a consideration of issues of credit in respect of each party and assumes critical importance in this case because the assaults, which happened at home, were not witnessed by any outsider.

Credibility of the plaintiff 

58The plaintiff like many witnesses was not always good with dates. Two examples from the defendant's submissions are appropriate.

At T658, line 25 Cooper was asked questions about the period he was in Melbourne and at line 27 said he believed he said it was 1995 when he went there. An examination of Cooper's 1993/94 and 1994/95 Tax Returns reveal that he was clearly running Wetcheck Roof Restorers business in Enoggera in Queensland and demonstrates that the evidence of Ms Mulcahy as to when he went to Melbourne, namely 1993, is correct. 

Cooper is clearly incorrect in his recollection of dates. Again at T658, line 27 in reference to when he went to Melbourne he said:-

I believe I said it was '95 I went there. 

whereas in his affidavit of 22 September 2009, paragraph 12 he said in ""about 1992"" he moved from Brisbane to Melbourne and stayed for about a year.

59Another example was as follows:

At T725, line 40 Cooper was asked when he first met Peter George and answered ""in the early 2000's I believe"" and then said ""the early 2000's 1 2 3 something like that"" however when suggested as follows, line 45:-

Question: You see may I suggest to you that it was 2005?
Answer: Yes it could be yes. 

This exchange demonstrates that Cooper's memory is consistently faulty and he would seemingly say anything to get to the next question if he suspected there was proof of the proposition being put.

60At times he could be argumentative. An example appears at T749 when the plaintiff was cross-examined about the beer incident. The following is seen at line 43:

Question: Following those events you drove away for the day did you not?
Answer: Drove away.
Question: I suppose you deny that?
Answer: No hang on I drove away for the day. Well hang on this is supposed to happen in the afternoon or the evening. Not only that I've allegedly been drinking and yet I get in a car and drive away. Ask anybody around. I do not drink during the day. I certainly do not drink when I'm driving and I certainly do not drink when I'm working in the shed or on the farm because if I got injured Ms Mulcahy could not drive me to hospital. She cannot drive so in terms of me drinking while I'm working it doesn't happen. 

61It was submitted that this was an example of Cooper's editorialising - said to be one of the signal stigmata of the unsatisfactory witness. 

62At T750 line 9 the plaintiff was directed to the opening words of paragraph 318 of Ms Mulcahy's affidavit,:-

Question: - do me the courtesy of looking at paragraph 318 and tell me what its opening words are?
Answer: ""In the morning.""
Question: ""In the morning Bob drove away""
Answer: Right.
Question: You're just constructing arguments to try and persuade the Court that the truth.
Answer: No you said to me...

Then at line 38:-

""Question: So your lengthy dissertation on driving at night when you've been drinking doesn't really...
Answer: That's correct it doesn't apply.
Question: ...assist does it?
Answer: No it doesn't but it certainly applies in terms of working drinking and working in the shed. 

63This in my view illustrates his argumentative nature.

64There are other more serious matters. In his affidavit of 22 September 2009, paragraph 25 the plaintiff, referring to a discharge of a mortgage to the ANZ Bank over the property at 30 River Road Harwood owned by Ms Mulcahy and her son Wade, said as follows:-

On the basis that the property has been re-mortgaged and the bank required all parties' signatures prior to discharge I believe that someone forged my signature on the Discharge Authority.

65The mortgage had been re-financed with the Bendigo Bank Limited. 

At T598, line 9:-

Question: And you have taken care to make sure that everything in your affidavit was true?
Answer: Yes.
Line 12:-

Question: Where is the forgery of your signature, a signature that purports to be that of you, Robert Cooper? 

Line 17:-
Answer: It's not there,

Line 21:-
Answer: No it doesn't exist. 

At T599, line 4:-
Question: Do you still maintain there's been a forgery?
Answer: No I do not. 

66There was no re-examination of the plaintiff in respect of this matter.

67It was submitted that this exemplifies a sworn allegation of criminal conduct that was patently untrue and shows how much was required to get just one frank admission of an obvious truth from this witness. In my view it exemplifies a careless attitude to evidence.

68An example of a tendency to exaggerate appears starting at T605, line 26 - 40. The plaintiff was asked questions about paragraph 516 of his affidavit of 4 November 2010 where he deposed he ""spent many nights with her in Brisbane and we had a full and active sexual life"" after 24 September 2007 the date of separation.

T605, line 43:-

Question: That was the date (24 September 2007) you deposited Ms Mulcahy in Brisbane for dental treatment?
Answer: I think that was the day yes.
Question: That is true is it? That by her invitation you spent many nights with her in Brisbane.
Answer: Yes I did. 

T606, line 1:-

Question: Could I suggest to you that in an email on 7 August 2008 you wrote these words 
""Think about how many times you invited me to come and see you and spend some time with you. Grand total since October once."" 
Your words or not?
Answer: Yes my words. 

(the period involved was some 10 months).

69It was submitted the plaintiff was caught out lying in an affidavit. He went on later in evidence to give an explanation, which was a most curious interpretation of ""invitation"" given his use of the word invitation in his email. Plainly he was exaggerating.

70The plaintiff's conduct in an attempt to settle the case shows that he is quite capable of attempting to gain an advantage by not disclosing the whole circumstances. At T588, line 25, Cooper agreed that he had his then solicitors file a Notice of Ceasing to Act on 31 August 2010. This was 20 days after the $30 million lottery win. At T588, line 27, Cooper agreed he came to Sydney to negotiate a settlement on his own behalf with the solicitor representing the defendant. At T591, in answer to question as to why he elected to undertake his own defence at lines 5 - 10, the plaintiff replied:-

For various reasons I was, I believed I was facing bankruptcy. I was facing losing the relationship which I held very strongly with my new partner, now my wife, caused by, I believed a deliberate attempt to - and in fact it was a stated attempt that I was going to be bought to my knees and if that involved me being sent bankrupt, well so be it and it was at that point. 

At T591, line 10:-

So it was economic stress, the fear of bankruptcy?

Answer: 
Absolutely. 

71The transcript at T687 illustrates the $30 million lottery win was 10/11 August 2010. The plaintiff's current wife, Ms Borrett, had her last day at Janmel on 19 August 2010. On 31 August 2010 the plaintiff's solicitor was no longer acting (lines 1 - 10) and after 27 August 2010 the plaintiff was self represented.

72On 30 September 2010 the plaintiff sent an email to Marco Williams of AR Conolly & Company, the defendant's solicitors. T689 shows the 30 September email was sent ""around a week maybe less than or maybe more than the days on which Shane and Trevor's contracts for their new homes were accepted"" - line 5. The plaintiff agreed he said in this 30 September email to AR Conolly:-

I do not have the funds or the borrowing capacity to meet those obligations and therefore the bank would take possession of the house at ............... which they would hold as security to cover their money. If I can be so bold as to say I believe the tactics of your client was to beat me into submission by running me out of money through these proceedings. Well it now appears that your client's tactics have been successful. Perhaps a little too successful for her own good. 

T689, line 47:-

That's what I wrote yes. 

73At T690, lines 5 - 10 the plaintiff denied that he was pretending to go bankrupt or that he set out to deceive the opposing lawyers by pretending that he could not afford a lawyer and was about to go into bankruptcy.

At T692, line 7:-

Question: Mr Cooper I take it that you hotly deny any proposition at all that you were anxious about the other side finding out about your spouse's lotto win. You deny any anxiety about that do you?
Answer: Of course I do not deny that. 

74It was submitted in light of the plaintiff's admission that he is entitled to half of the $30 million lottery proceeds, that it is an available finding, and the Court would come to the conclusion, that the purpose of approaching AR Conolly and suggesting he was going bankrupt was to disguise the fact that he had funds available to him and that the matters set out in the email were no more than a pretence and set out to deceive. 

75The plaintiff referred to his evidence at T691:

Q. That it was her proposal that it be only in her name?
A. Mr Williams, the house--

Q. Is that what you tell his Honour?
A. I'm telling you the house at Coffs Harbour was bought by Miss Borrett with her money because, when she won the Lotto, she refused to - after a couple of days - this didn't happen on the first day - after a couple of days the realisation came to her that I was in a fair sort of a mess with this case. It looked very much like I was going to run out of funds before it even looked like coming to a conclusion.

Q. Yes?
A. She had been harassed and intimidated by the defendant's son at our
home. She felt that if the knowledge of $30 million and that she was still living there - she wanted to get away. She wanted to go to Coffs Harbour. So, she went down there. I helped her in looking for the properties, or at properties. She bought a home in her own name and she said to me:

""I'm sorry, until you get through this mess, we are not going to be in
a de facto relationship, because this woman will do anything to get
her hands on this money.""


76At 692 the following occurred:

Q. Mr Cooper, I take it that you hotly deny any proposition at all that you were anxious about the other side finding out about your spouse's Lotto win. You deny any anxiety about that, do you?
A. Of course I do not deny that. What I am saying to you is my greater anxiety was the fact that I was up to my armpits in trying to deal with this mess. My then partner, who had $30 million - and we both read the pre-nup agreement and it seemed to us that money didn't come into play; it was to do with joint accounts and property. And I'm saying to myself: Well, this is handy. I can't even fund the case I'm in. If Sue goes away from me, who knows what happens in six months, 12 months, 18 months' time, particularly if she received any more harassment. And I don't have the funds, whether I'm entitled to it or not, to pursue any entitlement, whether I had some or not, to get it back from her. I couldn't even fund the case that I'm in, let alone the case that potentially would come down the track. I was anxious about losing my partner. Very anxious.

Q. Have you finished?
A. Yes, I have.


77The plaintiff admits he was anxious about the other side finding out about the lotto win, because if they found out there would be no settlement. His concerns about his partner leaving him may have been true but he still attempted to obtain a favourable outcome by making statements, which were deceptive, as they took no account of the fact that she may not leave him and he may receive substantial funds.

78The more serious matter concerns his approach to the defendant's case by making blanket denials of a large part of the case. At T599, line 28 to 37 referring to the plaintiff's affidavit of 4 November, it was put to him that there were 432 denials of paragraphs in the defendant's affidavit and, of those, 300 were blanket denials. At line 41, the plaintiff agreed that he denied paragraph 127 and did not expand upon that denial (line 49-50). At T600, line 1, referring to paragraph 127:

Question: So, on oath, you have put before the Court the proposition that everything in that paragraph was untrue?
Answer: Yes.

79At T600, line 7 the paragraph says:

The conversation continued for an hour and Bob shouted at me and repeated words including you're a miserable selfish bitch, you have your children what about giving me space, time and space with mine.

Bob shouted at me and stood over me looking down at me close to my face. 

Line 21:-

Question: I take it you deny it?
Answer: Yes.
Question: It is totally untrue, is it?
Answer: Totally untrue. 

80At line 25 is was put to him that Ms Mulcahy said:-

Finally I left the room and I went to the lounge room and sat down. I felt intimidated and shaken. 

Question: Again totally untrue?
Answer: I don't know. The incident didn't happen. 

Line 31:-

Question: So it would be totally untrue for your former spouse to have said for example the whole incident in paragraph 127 being denied that you had left a note. You deny that, do you not?
Answer: I don't know what incident you are talking about. 

Line 47:-

Question: You, on oath, have denied the entirety of that paragraph, have you not? You've already said that have you not.

Line 51:-

Answer: Yes the entirety. I did write a note, yes, but not to do with that alleged incident. 

At T601, line 1:-

Question: So, in telling the whole truth, you did not see fit to say ""Oh I did write that note but it wasn't connected with this incident"" is that what you tell the Court?
Answer: Yes I am yes. 

81At T601, line 19, having been shown the note,:-

Question: What is it?
Answer: A note.
Question: What does it say?
Answer: It says ""I'll be back and after I get back from Melbourne to get the rest of my stuff. I strongly advise you not to be here so I'll ring first. PS I can't believe the poison you've got stored in you going back so far."" Then it says ""F you."" 

Line 30:-

Question: Then it says what?
Answer: F you.
Question: No it does not. It says in great big capitals ""FUCK YOU"" with exclamation marks does it not? 
Answer: Yes it does.
Question: Just tell me please and tell the Court, what did you mean when you said ""I strongly advise you not to be here""?
Answer: What I meant by that was more than enough had been said to each other about some things that had been going on at the time and enough had been said. I was leaving to take the heat out of the situation. I was going to ring when I was coming back so whatever conversation had happened was going to desist and finish. 

Line 47:-

Question: You finish the note saying ""Fuck you"" is that it?
Answer: I said I left to take the heat out of the situation. 

T602, line 19:-

Question: Why did you put that in there ""I strongly advise you not to be here""?
Answer: Because more than enough had been said in the argument. The argument had got very heated. I left to take the heat out of the situation.
I wrote a letter. I was quite angry and I wrote that to say: So that this does not continue I'll give you a call letting you know that I'm coming. I'm coming back to pick up my stuff and essentially I don't want to see you anymore or listen to all that had been going on.
Question: You did not intend to be intimidating to her in any way did you?
Answer: Mr Williams if I intended to be intimidating to her I would not write a note I would have walked into the lounge room and intimidated her. 

82Here it was submitted, is caught an echo of what the plaintiff in fact did in the ""beer assault"".

83The handwritten note referred to is Exhibit 8, tendered at T603. Paragraph 127 of the defendant's affidavit sets out the fact of the note and the actual words used in it.

At T603, line 9:

Question: Now would you like to tell us how you say it came about that you wrote Exhibit 8? 
...
Answer: We had quite a strong argument I guess and it had gone on for a fair while and it was getting more and more intense. I was being blamed for everything except global warming and the unrest in the Middle East. It was getting very frustrating for me so it blew up. I decided not to be there anymore to take the heat out of the situation.
At that point I was on my way to Melbourne to have a look at the business that we were considering taking over within the next few days. I wrote that note. I started to write you know I'm not responsible for everything that goes wrong in your life. I guess I just didn't want to continue on with that. I scrubbed through it and wrote those last two letters. I left and that was it. 

84The defendant submits that the blanket denial of everything in paragraph 127 which was re-affirmed in evidence T600, line 1 (set out above) demonstrates that the plaintiff was prepared to deny to the nth degree, unless otherwise caught out, anything that remotely suggested any of the allegations made by the defendant were true.

85At T600, line 47 - 51 (set out above), the plaintiff's admission that he did write a note but not to do with that incident was said to demonstrate unequivocally his attempts to shuffle away from matters, which may prejudice him. The defendant submits that he ought simply not be accepted as to what he says.

86Given his approach, which is plainly wrong, it is very difficult to accept his blanket denials. A more important matter is his inability to remember what was said in the heat of the moment. This is well illustrated in the evidence concerning the ""head chatter"" article. At T651, Cooper was cross-examined about Exhibit 9 the ""Head Chatter"" article. At line 20 he agreed that David Bourke gave him the document. At line 27 he conceded he probably had a conversation about it with the defendant. (Note the plaintiff first denied recollection of the article at all and asserted it was not in the defendant's affidavit - T720.12.) 

87At T652, line 4 and onwards the plaintiff said:-

I might have said ""Look, you know, I better read it"" or because I can never stop thinking about things you know. I don't know he gave me quite a number of things actually... 

At line 15:-
Question: Mr Cooper you know I'm questioning you about anything you said to Mrs Mulcahy concerning you in the context of the receipt of that article? You know that is what I am asking you about don't you?
Answer: Yes I do Mr Williams and what I'm saying to you is that I believe I may have said that that, you know, it could be me because I don't stop thinking about things as well in the context of head chatter. 
At 20:-

Question: You know the defendant has deposed on oath concerning what you said in the context of the article don't you?
Answer: No I do not. I don't believe she mentions this article at all in her affidavit. 

88At T652 line 25, paragraph 587 of the defendant's affidavit was put to Cooper:-

Question: Tell me if this rings any bells with you Mr Cooper - paragraph 587
In approximately June or July 2008 Bob and I talked about this and other incidents. Bob had said to me on other occasions in the past words to the effect of ""If you were a bloke I'd knock your fucking head in and I forget you're a sheila and not a bloke"". Bob and I talked about this and other incidents after Bob showed me an article given to him by David Bourke about head chatter.
Bob told me ...""
Is this coming back to you at all?
Answer: It is now yes. 

At line 47:-
Question: Bob told me ""I virtually lose my mind at times and I don't recall what I have said. You know I would never hurt you. I said to him ""Remember when you dragged me down the stairs and threatened to kill me?"" He said ""I honestly and truly don't remember that. I didn't hurt you did I? I know I honestly would never hurt you.""
I did not tell him I'm scared of him. I'm scared he will harm me and my sons in some way. I'm afraid of him. I'm deeply afraid of him. I'm deeply increasingly disturbed by his behaviour.
Now do you remember the context now?
Answer: Yes I do. 

At T653, line 10:-

Question: Do you remember on your oath point blank denying that entire evidence that I've read out to you?
Answer: I don't know whether I point blank but I'm sure I denied it because I was denying the whole sequence of events that had been portrayed, yes. 

89The defendant submits that these questions and answers reveal that Cooper's failure to remember anything about the article dealing with head chatter in evidence (T652, lines 20 - 25) demonstrates that, whether he remembered or not, he was prepared to deny any suggestion put to him either from the defendant's evidence or affidavits or in cross-examination that was adverse to his interests, unless and until confronted with no other alternative. 

90At T720, line 11 while being cross-examined about paragraph 587 of the defendant's affidavit the plaintiff was asked:-

Question: I want to ask you this. Do you absolutely deny ever having said words to the effect ""I virtually lose my mind at times and I don't recall what I've said"". Do you absolutely reject you ever said anything to that effect?
Answer: I can't answer that yes or no, would you allow me to tell the one time I did say something?
Question: Mr Cooper ... your counsel has a right to re-examine you.
Answer: OK well the answer's no, not those words in that context.
Question: I asked you whether you would deny ever having said words to that effect ""I virtually lose my mind at times and I don't recall what I've said."" Now will you on oath say you have never said to her words to that effect?
Answer: I will deny it. 

91The defendant submits that analysis of the answers given support the submission that the plaintiff was consistently evasive. The contrast between an answer ""well the answer is no, not those words in that context"" and an absolute denial that he had ever said to her words to that effect, it was submitted does not stand up.

92The subject matter namely losing his mind and not recalling what he has said are very important given that the assaults invariably may have occurred when the plaintiff was very angry and violent. Further cross-examination on the note left before the trip to Melbourne illustrates the point. 

At T603, line 12:-

We had quite a strong argument ... ... it was getting very angry very frustrating for me, so it blew up 

T603, line 50:-

It was a heated argument. 

T604, line 8:-

Question: Were you angry?
Answer: Yes. 

T604, line 41:-

Question: So what do you say had provoked the argument?
Answer: I don't remember.
Question: Having left that note you do not remember what the argument was about?
Answer: No I don't. 

93If he cannot remember what provoked the arguments he may not even remember what he said.

94At T692 the plaintiff was asked:-

Question: Have you said in your affidavits you've only once lost your temper with Ms Mulcahy?
Answer: I'm not losing my temper.
Question: I wonder if you'd answer my question.
Answer: What was the question?
Question: Can you not remember?
Answer: I want you to repeat it clearly to me please.
Question: Do you find as she alleges 
Answer: No.
Question: ... in her affidavit. ...
Answer: No I'm wanting to know whether you, you asked me about losing my temper.
Question: - that you cannot remember the things that you have said when you are angry?
Answer: Uh uh.
Question: Is that the problem you're having now?
Answer: No it's certainly not. 

95At T693 the plaintiff recalled he had only lost his temper once in the 16 years with the defendant.

96The defendant submits that the demeanour of the plaintiff when being asked the above questions, and on other occasions in evidence, demonstrated a disposition in keeping with that described in the defendant's affidavit and oral testimony. The defendant submits that the assertions made by her as to the plaintiff's behaviour were borne out in Court and she ought be accepted.

97From my assessment of the plaintiff in the witness box and notwithstanding his restrained approach to the questioner for most of the time, he appeared to be a person who could become quite angry. He was a big bluff man. It may well be that he has difficulty recalling the details of what happened when he was angry. This is another difficulty, which compounds the main difficulty namely, that he has made a blanket denial of the assault cases which is not appropriate. Accordingly I do not accept that he always gives accurate evidence.

Credibility of the defendant 

98In Dowrick v Sissons (1996) 20 Fam LR 466 I first referred to the parties duty to properly present their financial circumstances to the Court. This view has been adopted on many occasions since that case.

99In this case it was held that 
In proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 NSW, s 20 , there is a clear obligation on each of the parties to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant financial circumstances. The obligation arises independently of any order for discovery.

100At 472 I stated:

The principles to be applied in this regard are important and need some discussion. The Family Court of Australia has consistently held that there is a clear obligation on a party to proceedings in that court to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant financial circumstances. That court has adopted what was said by Lord Brandon for the House of Lords in Livesey v Jenkins [1985] AC 424 at 437: 

I stated earlier that, unless a court is provided with correct, complete and up-to-date information on the matters to which, under s 25(1), it is required to have regard, it cannot lawfully or properly exercise its discretion in the manner ordained by that subsection. It follows necessarily from this that each party concerned in claims for financial provision and property adjustment (or other forms of ancillary relief not material in the present case) owes a duty to the court to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts to the other party and the court. This principle of full and frank disclosure in proceedings of this kind has long been recognised and enforced as a matter of practice. The legal basis of that principle, and the justification for it, are to be found in the statutory provisions to which I have referred. 

I have also taken the same approach in this jurisdiction. See a judgment of Taggart v Gaston (unreported, 7 December 1992). A similar approach is also taken in the Equity Division in Family Provision Act matters see Westreat v Corban (unreported, Young J, 29 September 1989). In my judgment in Taggart v Gaston I referred to the need to identify in this context the amount of the assets which had not been disclosed to the court pursuant to the obligation which I accepted arose in the proceedings. Such obligation incidentally arises independently of any order for discovery.

101In this regard there are two matters of importance concerning the defendant. The first is that until day 6 of the trial the plaintiff had not fully disclosed what had happened to the sale of Gaythorne and the purchase of a property by the Mulcahy Family Trust. 

102The second matter was that it only emerged during the hearing in cross-examination that the rental from the River Road property was received in a CBA account operated by the defendant's son on her behalf. It will be recalled that the defendant owned a 50% interest in that property. 

103Both these matters are serious matters that affect the credit of the defendant. 

104It was suggested by the plaintiff that the defendant was prone to exaggeration and reference was made to the change in paragraph 211 of her affidavit where the words, ""hundreds"" in one place was changed to ""many"". This was in reference to the occasions when the defendant alleged the plaintiff said, ""Someone should give you a fucking smack in the mouth"". This to my mind does not illustrate a general tendency to exaggerate her evidence.

105What is of more concern is her failure to answer questions. On numerous occasions the defendant commenced an answer to a question, ""Oh my goodness"" or ""goodness"". Very often what followed on these occasions was either a lack of recall or a suggestion that someone else be asked about it or even more frankly, on one occasion, ""Oh my goodness, I do not know how to answer that question"".

106On another occasion, ""Oh goodness. I - I don't - I don't recall specifically, no"". 

107On one occasion when she was asked what her current medication was she said, ""Goodness, I think you will have to ask the doctors/I think it is - "". 

108Although there are some matters which indicate that the defendant has not put her case forward to the Court honestly in that she has not given all necessary financial information I did not get the impression that she was prone to exaggeration. She did appear, however, to evade answering some questions. Accordingly, her evidence has to be treated with caution.

The individual assaults

109I note that an assault consists of:

""Intentionally creating in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. If the threat is actually carried out, the whole incident is properly described as an 'assault and battery'. Usually both offences occur in rapid succession, and in common parlance the word 'assault' is frequently used as including a battery. But the one offence may be committed without the other. A battery may be inflicted on a victim who does not expect it and therefore cannot complain of an assault, as where the victim is struck from behind without warning. Conversely there may be an assault without battery if the threat to inflict lawful force is not in fact carried out. 

Assault allows redress for the creation of an undesired emotional state unaccompanied by external injury. This is unusual for tort law, but it was decided at an early stage that assault warranted legal redress, partly as an aid to punishing offenders who had attempted to commit the crime of battery, partly because it minimised the temptation to retaliate. 

Since the gist of assault lies in the apprehension of impending contact, the effect on the victim's mind created by the threat is the crux, not whether the defendant actually had the intention to follow it up. The intent required for the tort of assault is the desire to arouse apprehension of physical contact, not necessarily to inflict actual harm. Hence it is actionable to point a pistol for the mere purpose of frightening. It is sufficient if the threat would have aroused an expectation of physical aggression in the mind of a reasonable person not afflicted with exaggerated fears or peculiar and abnormal timidity. But the plaintiff need not have been actually frightened: apprehension is not the same as fear, and one too courageous to be intimidated is nonetheless entitled to redress. There must, however, be an apparent ability to carry out the threat immediately. Lunging at someone who is obviously out of range does not count as assault, unless the intended victim had reasonable grounds for fearing that the defendant would immediately have come within range and landed a blow. It is an assault to point a pistol at another in such a way as to induce the belief that the plaintiff is about to be shot even if, unknown to the plaintiff, the pistol is unloaded. But a threatened coup d'etat did not constitute an assault where no one capable of carrying out violent attacks had yet arrived in the relevant country. 

See Carolyn Sappideen et al, Fleming's The Law of Torts, 10th ed (2011) Thomson Reuters at 2.70.

110I will first deal with those assaults where there are some suggestions of corroborative material. As I have already mentioned there were no witnesses to any of the assaults.

1. Alleged assault in May 1993 (threat in note)

111The relevant evidence given by the defendant was as follows:

126. In the meantime, before he left for Melbourne, Bob and I planned to take a short holiday in Yamba, where we had moved the caravan. We were going to have all our children with us, but before that happened Bob said to me 

Bob: ""Why do bloody Wade and David need to come? I really want to spend time with my kids - I see yours every day. ""

Me: ""Both you and your kids have been welcome to stay at Station Avenue whenever you wanted, over the past couple of years, and we have all made you more than welcome.""

Bob: ""I'm a bloody absentee father - you wouldn't fucking remotely know what that feels like.""

He was to repeat this last comment to me often, for many years.

127. The conversation continued for an hour and Bob shouted at me and repeated words including ""you're a miserable, selfish bitch. You have your children. What about giving me time and space with mine."" 

I said: ""It would be good if they were all together with us on this occasion. I don't understand you with Dave and Wade. They were so good to you when you were down and out. Have you forgotten?"".

Bob said: "" Fancy remembering those things. How petty. That's poison you've got stored up saying that to me. You've got a memory like an elephant.""

Bob shouted at me and stood over me looking down at me, close to my face Finally, I left the room. I went into the lounge room and sat down. I felt intimidated and shaken. I could hear Bob moving about in the bedroom. That evening I did not see him again. After a while I heard his car start. I went into the kitchen and I found a written note by Bob which said: 

""I'll be back after I get back from Melbourne to get the rest of my stuff. I'd strongly advise you not to be here so I'll ring first. PS. I can't believe the poison you've stored going back so far. FUCK YOU!!!!!""

128. We did not take the holiday as planned.

129. To my knowledge, Bob spent a week or two with his children at Noosa and then went to Melbourne to take over the Roof Shield business. 

112A copy of the note left by the plaintiff is in evidence as exhibit 8. It can be recalled from previous evidence that I have quoted above that the defendant concedes that he wrote the note, that it was preceded by an argument which occurred before a trip by him to Melbourne. The defendant could not recall what the argument was about. Notwithstanding this he denied the conversations alleged by the defendant.

113The reference to her sons being good to him was an occasion when the plaintiff first came to live with the defendant when he wanted to borrow $7,000 to buy a car. He could not borrow it and he used her sons credit worthiness to borrow the money. Given the matters that support the defendant's version of events I will accept her evidence of the conversations.

114She has spoken in her evidence of fear and the threat in the note is sufficient to establish the circumstances as an assault.

2. Alleged assault on 18 February 2008 (verbal attack)

115The defendants evidence was as follows:

582. On 18 February 2008 as part of our efforts at reconciliation, Bob and I were having dinner together on the deck at Mitchelton when Bob suddenly and unexpectedly started screaming at me:

""All our successes have been due to me. All our failures are due to the fucking miserable Mulcahys ... Your bloody boys in particular.

I could easily destroy David's business. All it would take is one phone call. 

I could easily get that general manager's position Wade is applying for at Dimension Data. I could get that job over Wade without doubt ... piece of piss! 

I could destroy them. I know people who could seriously hurt them, the fucking miserable arrogant bastards.

That fucking David should have his fucking lips cut off, with that fucking arrogant smirk.

I ought to break both their legs.

It just takes one phone call to destroy their prospects. Cunts!

I've had many conversations with David's staff. I know what they really think of him.

David and Wade are only using you. Once they've got what they want from you, they'll ditch you.

The reason we're in this fucking mess is because of your fucking kids.""

583. Bob stood over me. I felt intimidated and frightened. He paced up and down on the deck, repeating himself and the vicious threats directed at my sons for approximately half an hour. I was unable to respond. I also feared that if I had, his verbal attack would have continued. I sat there until I eventually quietly said 

I'm going to the bedroom"".

584. I stayed in the bedroom. I covered my ears with the pillow. Bob stomped around the house still yelling, eventually settling in the lounge room where he drank and muttered to himself. When he eventually came into the bedroom we said words to the effect:

Me: ""You should know you shouldn't say things like that to a mother"". 

Bob: ""I forget you're a sheila and not a bloke"". 

585. Bob had said to me on other occasions in the past words to the effect of:

""If you were a bloke I'd knock your fucking head in"".

586. Bob left Mitchelton the next day. As soon as he left, I threw up. 

116The defendant points to the series of emails that flowed in the wake of the events of 18 February 2008. It was submitted that they have corroborative value. There were many emails immediately after this time some of which were affectionate.

117Exhibit P,95 is an email from Ms Mulcahy to Cooper:

Am going now to that dark place to deal with Monday night 

- she had on the previous day emailed:-

Unnecessary for me to respond on Monday night - unnecessary to react now. Or did/do I just feel intimidated etc 

But significantly and in my view corroborative of the affidavit evidence particularly paragraph 584 is the email from the plaintiff one week after 18 February (Exhibit P,112) where he refers to:-

You humble me and shame me to myself by thanking me for supporting you through a rough time caused by my inability to not broach that area of our lives that is very, very sensitive to both of us until the time and the circumstances were better. I forgot you're a girl and not a bloke with tits and a vajin. Bad choice by me. Very bad delivery. Will not under any circumstances allow myself to get to that level ever ever again etc. 

118Exhibit P, 114 included Ms Mulcahy's words:-

So appreciate your loving and gentle words, do not know where to go with the violent and vicious ones .... 

119At T717.38 the plaintiff simply denies any knowledge of what words they might have been.

120It was submitted by the defendant that what the defendant wrote concerning the events of 18 February 2008 in emails is cogent corroboration of her account in a way analogous to complaint evidence - here there is appropriate contemporaneity and perhaps more tellingly still, they were written not in any shadow of litigation nor mood of accusation or reproach but in a seemingly conciliatory context.

121The defendant referred to a further example of the plaintiff's dissembling which is said to be found in his attempted explanation for the email Exhibit P,95 from Ms Mulcahy:-

I am now going to that dark place to deal with Monday night .... 

122The plaintiff agrees this referred to the night of Monday, 18 February but was apparently compelled to add:-

Yes but it was more about the dark place, because she suffered from quite severe episodes of withdrawing into herself. 

caused in his (the plaintiff's) alleged belief by ""menopause"".

123I am prepared to accept the defendant's evidence but note that this discussion also concerned a dispute between the parties about rearranging securities and the Mulcahy Family Trust. As pointed out by the plaintiff there were no threats to the defendant. They were all addressed to her children. In these circumstances there is no assault on the plaintiff.

3. Alleged assault in May 2008 (swearing over the phone)

124The evidence given by the plaintiff was as follows:

597. On or about 6 May 2008, Bob was at home at Harwood and I was in Brisbane. Bob was due to receive the results of medical tests. I had returned home to Mitchelton later than expected and did not phone him that day to find out about his test results. Bob phoned me later that evening and immediately started screaming, 

""Cunt....cunt... cunt... you miserable selfish fucking cunt"" 

over and over again. 

598. Bob repeated it so often that I started writing the words on a newspaper I had beside me, in an effort to finally convince myself that I did not need to put up with this type of abuse. 
599. After the call, I threw up. That night, I stuck the newspaper to the bedroom wall as a reminder of the quality of Bob's and my relationship. 

125The piece of paper was tendered and became ex Q. The piece of paper was a newspaper cutting, which was dated 6 may 2008, on which the defendant appears to have scrawled her notes. In cross-examination the plaintiff said the following:

Q. On about 6 May 2009 you had some medical tests done as described at 597? 

A. Yes. I would have to have a look at my medical records but I think that's about right, yes.

Q. If I could spare myself the verbatim repetition by asking you Mr Cooper whether you agree or disagree that you screamed over the phone to Mrs Mulcahy the words set out in 597? 

A. No, I did not. I did have a conversation with her that evening, or an evening around about then. Oh sorry when I had my tests, yes. I think I had my tests before this date actually, from my medical records.

Q. You have seen the scribbled note of what you are said to have screamed at her over the phone?

A. Well I don't know that that is - that has no relevance to me. I did not scream that to her over the phone.

Q. You have seen the date on the piece of newspaper?

A. Yes. is that the 6th May?

Q. All I asked you is if you had seen the date?

A. Well it is relevant Mr Williams, because my tests were prior to that newspaper date.

Q. Do you deny that you have ever uttered words of that ilk to her?

A. I have never abused her like that, no I have not.

Q. Can you offer to the Court any plausible explanation why she would have written that down on the paper that we have seen in Court?

A. Yes I can.

Q. Do you say she has fabricated it?

A. I would say she is writing it about herself. When I had my medical results, my medical tests, when I got the results I spoke to her. I phoned and I asked her how my results went. That was prior to that date, I am sure. Well, I'm not sure, but I need to check on that.

Q. I think I understand Mr Cooper, you are telling his Honour ""No, no, that is not something I would have said, she is writing about herself"", is that what you are saying?

A. Yes. Sorry, no. You asked me for a scenario that could have happened. I am not saying that happened, what I am saying is that is the only explanation I can give.

126Records from the plaintiff's doctor were tendered but they give no information as to when results were received. They do show his attendance at the doctor on 7, 22, and 28 April and 6 May 2008. His initial explanation makes no sense and his denial may just be a lack of ability to recall his violent outbursts. I am prepared to accept the defendant's evidence but there is a real question as whether there was an assault given that it was over the phone after the parties had separated and there were no words, which suggested a physical attack was contemplated.

127I was referred to the case of R v Ireland [1997] QB 114 and the appeal to at [1998] AC 147 which concerned repeated silent telephone calls to a number of women. It was held that an assault might be committed by words or gestures alone depending on the circumstances and that where the making of a silent telephoner call caused fear of immediate and unlawful violence the caller would be guilty of an assault. The present case is quite different and there does not seem to be any suggestion of a fear of immediate and unlawful violence. 

128In my view the conduct, although abusive, does not amount to an assault.

4. Alleged assault from 1993 (abusive language)

129The defendant's evidence was as follows:

117. By early to mid 1993 Bob often said to me,

""All you Mulcahys are selfish. You've got no idea how to fucking live or behave"" and

""You're a private school overeducated cunt"" 

""You've all got a holier than thou attitude. The holy fucking Mulcahy trinity need a fucking smack in the fucking mouth"". 

118. . My few friends began to dwindle as Bob did not like any of them and they ceased to visit. Bob was rude to visitors. One was Ronz de Souza. 
When Ronz made a comment that Bob did not like, Bob often said to him, 
""That's bullshit you fucking curry-muncher"" 
When Ronz left the house, he usually said,
""See you later"".
Bob usually responded,
""Don't hurry back"".
Increasingly when any associate of mine came into the house was unwelcome. Bob would leave the room. Bob would be curt. Bob would ignore my visitors and not talk to them. When they had left, Bob would criticise the guest. One of the common criticisms was, Bob saying to me,
""I can't stand them, I don't like them around""


211. .............................. He would also say to me on hundreds of occasions ""If you were a bloke I'd fucking knock your head in"". He would also say to me on many occasions ""Someone should give you a fucking smack in the mouth"". On other occasions he would say to me ""I should smack your fucking head in"" or ""I should give you a fucking smack in the mouth"". The fear that Bob has instilled in me has changed me emotionally and physically. These days I consider myself fearful and very vulnerable and quite unlike the person I was before I met Bob. I am also deeply fearful of Bob and feel I have lost control of my life. This was not the case before he came into my life. I am afraid he will do me physical harm. I have been deeply disturbed by the claims he has made in the Supreme Court proceedings for property that is mine and which I worked hard for and owned before he came into my life. And in many respects he destroyed my life.

130There is nothing to corroborate this claim. Given that some events, which include foul language, have been corroborated, I am inclined to accept the defendant's evidence of the use of the language described. However paragraph 211 was not admitted as evidence of an assault. In respect of paragraph 117 there is no detail of what were the factual circumstances in which the words were used. When cross-examined the defendant could not say whether she was intimidated. Accordingly I am not satisfied that there was an assault.

5. Alleged assault and battery in 1995 (threat to kill and battery)

131The defendant's evidence was:

205. By early 1995, Wetcheck materials were littering up the back yard at Gaythorne so I said to Bob words to the effect:

""We should buy a shed so we can store Wetcheck's goods in there"". 

We purchased a second hand shed for $400.00. In preparation to erect the shed, David started levelling off a section of the backyard; however, it was quite a large job so David hired a bobcat to complete the job. After the yard was levelled, Bob still did not erect the shed as planned. The rubbish from Wetcheck kept piling up in the back yard.

206. On or about June 1995 I said to Bob words to the effect:

""Can we somehow complete the shed? The mess in the backyard is just piling up"". 

Bob took hold of my arm and dragged me down the back stairs from the kitchen to the backyard. I stumbled down the stairs, bumping the railings and losing my footing on the way. Bob pointed to the pile of timber, roofing and windows, which were all for the Wetcheck business, and Bob said to me:

Bob: ""What the fuck to do you call that? [indicating towards the disassembled shed]

Me: The shed's not for me or Station Ave, it's purely for Wetcheck's storage.

Bob: I can't fuckin' stand the sound of your fuckin' voice or the fuckin' sight of you. Get out of my fuckin' sight. Disappear. If you don't, I'll fuckin' kill you. I'm fuckin' out of here. I'm going to pack my stuff and find somewhere else to live. Don't come back till I'm gone. I promise you I'll fuckin' kill you.""

207. I went to the train station across the road and sat there for a couple of hours. I felt numb. I returned later that afternoon but Bob's ute was still there, so I knew he had not gone. I stayed hidden in the tool room downstairs. I could hear Bob on the phone upstairs, making enquiries for shared accommodation and then gathering his gear, loading the ute and leaving. . 

208. Bob returned a few days later while I was at home. He had a list with him and he said to me:

Bob: ""I'm just here to get the rest of my things.""

Me: ""Can I have my video player back?""

209. Bob left again. I do not know where he went. A few days later, Bob returned again and stayed. He resumed living at Gaythorne. I did not agree to him staying. Bob is charming but I was afraid of him and said nothing.

132I am prepared to accept the defendant in respect of the incident although there is no independent corroboration. Given the fact that she left the house I also accept it was an assault and that there was a battery.

6. Alleged assault in 1996 (removal from the house)

133The defendant's evidence was as follows:

237. On two occasions during the seven or eight months we lived in Maroochydore, Bob told me to leave. On the first occasion Bob yelled at me ""Get out of my fucking place. I'll get a fucking flat bed truck and pitch your fucking gear over the fucking balcony"". The reason for this outburst of rage was unclear to me.. I was shaking and in fear of Bob and what he might do to me. 

I telephoned David and said ""Would you please come and pick me up"", which he did. I stayed with David at Gaythorne. I did not contact Bob. A week or two later Bob came to Gaythorne and drove me back to Maroochydore. I do not recall saying ""Yes"" to resuming our relationship; I simply did not say ""No"", nor did I have the courage to do so. I recall during this time Bob paid $1,000.00 as part payment of monies owing to the inheritance account.

134Under cross examination she said:

Q. And if I could then take you to paragraphs 237 and 238, thank you. I am suggesting to you, ma'am, that the conversation that you have put there you have made up, haven't you?

A. No, I haven't. And the fact being that I didn't even know what he was referring to. It was a flat bed truck. Because it's the first time I have ever heard the term ""flat bed truck"".

Q. David did come and collect you on one occasion, is that right?

A. He did, yes.

135I accept the evidence and given the defendant's lack of understanding of the threat and the fact that she vacated the house I find there was an assault.

7. Alleged assault in 1996 (second removal from the house)

136The defendant's evidence was:

238. On the other occasion Bob and I were in bed. He yelled at me ""Get out of my fucking bed"". I have no recall of why he said this. I was afraid. I left the bed and I slept on the lounge. I was ashamed and on this occasion I did not ring David. The next morning Bob said to me ""get in the car. I'm driving you to Enoggera."" Bob drove me to Gaythorne where David was living at the time with his girlfriend Jill and I stayed with him at Gaythorne. I did not contact Bob. A week or so later Bob came to Gaythorne without arrangement.. He said to me ""How are you going. We've got to sort things- out"". I said to him ""I'd like to collect my gear."" He said ""I'll drive you to get it"". When we got back Bob said to me ""We should give it a go before you make the final decision and take your gear and leave. We should consider staying together and give it a go I didn't agree to give it a go, but I stayed.

137Although I accept the evidence of what happened I am not satisfied that there was an assault.

8. Alleged assault and battery in December 2000 (threat to shoot and 'beer incident')

138The defendants evidence was:

307. I refer to the Plaintiff's affidavit sworn 22 September 2009 at paragraph 37. Around 30 December 2000, Bob asked me, out of the blue, words to the effect:

""What do you reckon about us helping Trevor to buy a property?""

308. This completely surprised me. I said to Bob words to the effect:

""Trevor's never indicated a desire to buy a property. He's always moving from job to job. I don't think he has the interest, stability, commitment or finances to be able to make the repayments. However I don't have a problem helping Rebecca and Jason (her boyfriend) to use Gaythorne to help them with a loan"". 

309. Bob became very angry at my response. I don't ever recall Bob discussing these matters in good, happy and stable times.

139She then gave evidence about the afternoon in these terms:

312. By the afternoon after Bob had asked me about helping Trevor with a home loan, it was obvious to me that Bob was very angry: and he was pacing in and out of the house to the garage. We had already had a tense week together and had not been talking much for several days.

313. In the afternoon, I was sitting on the lounge reading and feeling tense. Bob said to me out of the blue: 

""If you were a bloke I'd smack your head in"". 

I did not say anything in response, as in my experience that always escalated Bob's anger. After a while I turned on the television.

314. Bob came in from the garage and said: 

""Stop fucking ignoring me""


and turned off the television. I sat there for some time. I was too anxious to read because I feared that would further inflame Bob. I feared that anything I did would make Bob more upset, so I just sat there.

315. Bob went in and out of the house several times. His body language indicated he was becoming more and more agitated and upset. He went to the refrigerator and took out a beer. On one of these trips from the fridge to the garage, as he passed by me sitting on the lounge, he poured the entire can of beer over my head, down my body and onto the lounge.

316. I just sat there. I was in what I thought of as 'block-out' mode. I was too anxious to have a shower, for fear of further inflaming Bob's temper. I just sat there, in a pool of spilled beer. I did not dare to have a shower, or go to bed, or to move because I knew he would start screaming. I sat there, adrenaline pumping and heart thudding, for what seemed like hours. I did not get off the lounge to go to the toilet, or read a book, or make dinner, or eat anything at all. I just sat there, waiting for him to go to bed.

317. Bob went to bed, perhaps an hour later. I knew he was finally asleep because I heard him snoring, at which point I got up, showered, and finally fell asleep at the other end of the large L-shaped lounge (not where the beer was spilled). I cleaned the couch the next day.

318. In the morning, Bob drove away and did not return until late that evening. I felt humiliated, weak and anxious after this incident. Neither of us mentioned the incident again until 2008 during our attempts to reconcile. 

140By leave she gave the following evidence about what also happened during this event.

Q. This beer incident which you have described commencing at paragraph 312 of your major affidavit -- is that correct?

A. I am not sure of the paragraph, but yes.

Q. Tell us what in fact was said in the course of this walking in and out as you describe it?

A. Most of the time he was just screaming, every time he walked in and out of the house. And on one particular occasion he said ""This is driving me fucking nuts, I really should get rid of the rifles. I am either going to shoot you or shoot myself or both of us.""

Q. Do you recall in the course of the preparation of your major affidavit anything happened when you were dealing and committing that part of your evidence into the affidavit?

A. Yes, I found it very difficult and I said in my affidavit -- it brought me to tears.

Q. When the words were actually uttered back on or about 31 December 2000 what was the effect of the utterance about?

A. I was terrified.

141There is no doubt that the plaintiff had two rifles but one of them was a .303 held as security for a debt and in respect of which he did not have the bolt. In respect of the other to the knowledge of the defendant he had used it in the past and had ammunition for it. She did complain about this incident to Dr Kraushaar in September 2009 but surprisingly not to Dr Fisher or Dr Klug. On this the plaintiff submitted:

This is very significant. This incident is possibly the most dramatic of the incidents alleged throughout the relationship of the parties. The Plaintiff not only does not make any contemporaneous complaint but when she sees Dr Fisher in January 2010 she does not tell him about it and then when she sees medico legal practitioners for the purpose of this litigation relating to this very event, she does not tell them. It is submitted this is because it did not happen.

Further the Defendant says she did not tell anybody about this incident. In the affidavit of David Mulcahy at par 103, he asserts that his mother told him of the Plaintiff pouring wine over her head. There is no suggestion that this is this incident, and as noted the Defendant does not assert she told David about it. So what is to be made of David Mulcahy's evidence? At the very least that it is unreliable, and given in respect of irrelevant matters which did not occur and which are not complained about, in an attempt to assist his mother's case.

142There was further cross-examination about the shape of the lounge but this was not helpful in resolving the veracity of what was said. The defendants submissions on this aspect were as follows:

Cooper in his affidavit of 4 November 2010, paragraphs 312 - 318 denied the events alleged by Ms Mulcahy and specifically said:-

At the relevant time the lounge suite is not L-shaped but is in fact a rather small straight lounge. 

He said that he had photographs of that lounge suite which he cannot presently locate.

Cooper was shown Exhibit O (produced by him) containing two photographs of a lounge and at T657, line 11 answering a question about the make of the sofa said:-

I think the defendant in her testimony said it was a Moran and I think I agree with her. I think it was a Moran yes. 

Cooper produced receipts for a different make of sofa, namely a Natuzzi T657, line 34, purchased in 2005 and at T657, line 45 was asked:-

Question: You heard the evidence of Ms Mulcahy as to how it could be configured and reconfigured didn't you?

Answer: Yes I did.

Question: And you still want to persist with your evidence that prior to '95 (sic - 2005) there couldn't have been a situation of you pouring beer over her while she was on an L-shape lounge?

Answer: No.

Question: Is that what you want to say?

Answer: No. What I say is in the year 2000 which is when the allegation is made, there was no L-shaped lounge in the home which is quite a different proposition that you're putting to me Mr Williams. 

Submitted what has happened here is simply this; Cooper has attempted to discredit Ms Mulcahy's account of this assault and battery by producing a photograph of the (agreed) Moran suite set up in a non L-shape. Further he says that a Natuzzi sofa purchased in 2005 (years after the event) was an L-shape (T658.12). Having conceded, in the face of Ms Mulcahy's evidence about the configuration in which the Moran lounge existed at the time of the events, he no longer wanted to persist in saying there couldn't have been a situation where he poured beer over her while she was on an L-shaped lounge, 

143This submission seems accurate. The defendant was cross-examined about the beer incident which was in these terms:

Q. And do you tell his Honour it was the whole can of beer that was poured over you?
A. He took a beer out of the fridge. I don't know one hundred per cent whether it was the entire - the beer that he had in his hand, he poured it over me. Whether it went right down to the bottom, how much was there, I can't tell
you. A lot.

Q. Did your head and hair contain beer?
A. Yes.

Q. Did it pour over your back?
A. It went down my back, yes.

Q. And did it go down inside your clothing or outside the clothing?
A. Oh, I don't even recall. I don't even recall.

Q. Did you feel the beer going down your back towards your buttocks?
A. I - well it ended up all over the lounge anyway.

Q. Sorry, what do you mean by that?
A. He held it over my head. He was behind me. He held it over my head and just poured and poured and poured. So, I wasn't even thinking about--

Q. Did the beer travel down your back and onto the lounge, is that what you are telling his Honour?
A. Yes.

Q. And do you remember what clothing you were wearing on the night?
A. I have no idea whatsoever.

Q. And you say that you sat on the lounge, you didn't go to the toilet or read a book or make dinner or do anything at all?
A. I attempted to turn on the T.V., and he walked back in at that stage and started screaming at me: ""Stop fucking ignoring me"", and he turned the T.V. off. So.

Q. You say this occurred on a large L-shaped lounge?
A. Yes.

Q. And that you were required to clean the couch the next day, is that right?
A. It is not that I was required, but I did do it.

144If one were to assume that the defendant's answer about turning on the television indicates that this happened after the plaintiff poured the beer on her, that answer would be contrary to the affidavit evidence. In her affidavit, the defendant states at paragraphs 314-316 that she turned on the television at a time before the beer was poured, and that after this she did not get off the lounge, she states, ""I just sat there...I did not dare to have a shower, or go to bed, or to move because I knew he would start screaming. I sat there, adrenaline pumping and heart thudding, for what seemed like hours. I did not get off the lounge to go to the toilet, or read a book, or make dinner, or eat anything at all. I just sat there, waiting for him to go to bed"".

145 The witness was not challenged about this inconsistency. Given the lack of a challenge and the possible ambiguity of what the witness was referring to, I will not accept that this was a change to her affidavit story.

146The rifles existed, the plaintiff could be an angry man, the defendant had been frightened of him over the years and I am prepared to accept the defendant's version of what occurred. There has been an assault and a separate battery.

9. Alleged assault after Christmas 2000 (verbal attack)

147The defendants evidence was:

304. A few days after Christmas 2000, and without my request or knowledge, Bob stopped at Gaythorne after returning his children to the Sunshine Coast. When Bob returned to 290 Southbank Road he said words to the effect:

""I've had to move furniture downstairs at Gaythorne and pack up the tool room, and I had to get Shane to help me - it's not my responsibility to do this shit. I've also left the key with the tenant. The fucking Mulcahys all fucking need a fucking smack in the fucking mouth"". 

305. Bob had used this phrase frequently in the past. Around this time I began to avoid speaking to or about my children in Bob's presence. I mostly phoned them when Bob was not around. I continued to try not to upset Bob.

306. I was at a loss as to how to deal with situation. 

148Although I accept the defendants evidence but given the lack of evidence about the effect on the defendant I am not satisfied it constitutes an assault. I note the cross examination of the defendant in these terms:

At T260.40 is this question and answer:


Q: But in respect of what is asserted there in paragraph 304 there was no threat made by Mr Cooper at that time was there?

A: At that particular juncture, no

10. Alleged assault in mid 2007 (threat to shoot)

149The evidence given was as follows at T319-320:

Q I will put my question to you again: are you able to identify by approximate date any other instance similar which involved the mention of rifles?

A. Yes.

Q. When was that?

A. That was in it -- -- I can't give you an exact date but it was March or April 2007.

Q. Where did it occur?

A. At Harwood, at our home in Harwood.

Q. In what context?

A. Bob and I had -- Bob was working at the phone shops and he was complaining about the staff and about the area. Things were pretty bad. And he continually said things like ""I am a big fish in a little pond"" and I turned around to him and said ""We are only shop keepers after all"", which I regretted, straight away. And he said -- he just flew off. I can't recall other things he said but he was yelling at me, walking in and out, yelling. And he said once again ""This is frustrating that shit out of me. I really should get rid of the rifles. I will either shoot myself, because I am going nuts, or shoot you.""

Q. What effect did that have on you and your recollection? 

A. It is a terrifying thing to hear. There were other instances that he said similar things.

150This alleged incident was first referred to at the trial when further evidence was given following an almost completed cross-examination of the defendant. It was never referred to in consultation with doctors. Plainly it was only recalled as a result of further questioning about paragraph 310 of her affidavit. That said, it has the ring of truth about it.

151I accept her evidence and it must have been very surprising given that there had been no instances of serious abuse for some seven years. I can accept that it may have terrified her. I am satisfied there was an assault.

Effect of assaults

152I turn to the question of what effect the assaults may have in the adjustment process. Plainly events after separation are not relevant and on this aspect of the case questions of the Limitation Act 1969 do not arise. The defendant relied on inter alia two cases under the Family Law Act 1975, Doherty v Doherty (1996) FLC 92-652 and Marando v Marando (1997) FLC 92-754. In the first of these cases the Full Court said at page 82,683:- 

""On page 26 the trial Judge made reference to the appellant's drinking habits and to domestic violence and aggression, which he exhibited towards the respondent and the children, particularly to S. Although the trial Judge did no more than record these events, it is clear from his findings that the wife's contribution as homemaker and parent may have been increased as a result thereof. 
Although the domestic violence complained of related to a relatively small period of time at the end of the marriage, nevertheless, his Honour would, in my opinion, have been entitled to have found that because of the appellant's conduct, the respondent's contribution diminished as a consequence, leading to the overall weighting based upon contribution in favour of the wife being increased, albeit only slightly, having regard to the facts of this case."" 

153Of interest is the reference to such conduct either increasing one party's contribution or diminishing the other party's contribution. 

154In Marando v Marando at 84,168-9 Gee J had the following to say about the issue of domestic violence. 

In my opinion however, the wife over the very long period of cohabitation made a much greater contribution than the husband to the welfare of the family, particularly as homemaker and parent. I am satisfied on the evidence that in her homemaker and parenting role the wife in that role and by way of general contribution to the family's welfare carried out responsibilities well beyond the norm. She had the responsibility of the home and the children almost entirely without the husband's assistance for a very long period of time. Amongst other things, she thereby enabled him to work and earn income over and above his full time work as well as his full time work. In this family she was the uniting force and the one who provided the support, love and affection necessary to maintain this particular family unit over a long time. 
This was made especially hard by the husband's abuse and denigration of her and the children in the ways described by them in their evidence, which I largely accept on this issue, as well as by his attitude to `women's work' and by his drinking which necessitated the wife working especially hard and harder than would be usual in normal situations as homemaker, parent and as the prime navigator of the welfare of this family through the many seas of problems and difficulties which confronted them over the years. 
These are special factors of the kind to which the Full Court drew attention in Ferraro v Ferraro 16 Fam LR 1, especially at pages 38, 39 and 47, that being a decision affirmed in McLay v McLay 20 Fam LR 239 at pages 248 to 249, and is no doubt what Baker J had in mind when speaking for the Full Court in Doherty v Doherty 20 Fam LR 137 at page 141. His Honour's remarks, although, in my respectful opinion, obiter and given in an extempore judgment, are entitled to great respect. They do not represent new law. It has been suggested in some quarters since that judgment was delivered that they have, but I disagree with that suggestion. 
The remarks of Baker J in Doherty's case were simply an expression, in the context of domestic violence, of the passages in Ferraro's case cited above. Neither Ferraro's case nor Doherty's case purported to overrule Soblusky (1976) 2 Fam LR 1, nor Ferguson (1978) 4 Fam LR 312, where investigation of fault or misconduct per se was deprecated. Any intention to overrule Ferguson was deprecated in Ferraro's case at page 39, and I am, with respect, unable to accept that either Fogarty J or Baker J, who were members of the Full Court in both Ferraro and Doherty, would have intended such decisions to be overruled without expressly saying so. 

155In Green v Robinson (1995) 36 NSWLR 96 Cole J at 119 after discussing the dictionary definitions of ""homemaker"" adopted the definition as ""one who creates and maintains a comfortable and welcoming ambience for the members of their household"". He went on to say at page 119:- 

""However, even such a second meaning is inadequate if it is intended to convey that only one person in a household may be responsible for the creation or maintenance of such a welcoming ambience for it is clear, in my view, that each party to a relationship, be it of marriage or of a de facto relationship, may contribute to the homemaking in which that relationship subsists. Parties to the relationship may, depending upon their various capacities, skills, inclinations, interests, available time and other factors, contribute significantly to the making of a home. The concept of "" homemaker"" or ""making of a home"" has a different and wider connotation than housekeeping or maintaining a house. It involves the creation of an emotional ambience of stability. 
To take but three examples. A person, not infrequently the male in the relationship, may have skills related to home improvements which are exercised for the mutual advantage of the parties in the relationship. That is an aspect of homemaking for it permits the more pleasant enjoyment of the domestic relationship. To similar effect, a person, most frequently the female in the relationship, may practice cooking and decorating skills which also are aspects of homemaking for they similarly lead to a comfortable and welcoming ambience in the home in which the parties in the relationship live. And each, both the male and female partners, may bring to the relationship aspects of stability, and attitudes of tolerance and understanding critical to the creation of a home. It is important to recognise that contributions as a homemaker may be qualitative as well as quantitative, and that a lesser quantitative but higher qualitative contribution may be of equal or even greater importance and value to the relationship and the partners and children than a seemingly greater quantitative contribution. 
The width of aspects of contribution, and in some instances the amorphous qualities which a party may bring as his or her contribution as a homemaker to a relationship, highlights the difficulty of trying to quantify in precise money terms the contribution of each party. It lends emphasis to the need for the Court in most instances to exercise a significant element of judicial assessment in determining whether it is just and equitable that a property adjustment be made. '

156Clearly his Honour includes the qualitative aspects as well as the quantitative. Accordingly in the adjustment process it is possible to take account of these actions of the plaintiff in assessing the defendant's homemaker contributions. In this case the defendant seeks that the effect on contributions be considered as well as seeking judgment for assault. 

157The homemaker contributions put forward by the plaintiff are:


the execution of minor maintenance and repairs 
managing finances 
assistance with household chores 
as the defendant did not drive the plaintiff drove her whenever she needed to go anywhere 

158The defendant gave more detail in relation to household matters and in particular she said:


Her sons did household garden chores at Gaythorne, Cooper did not attend to any domestic matters (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 113).


In Melbourne, she attended to food preparation, cleaning and homemaking and provided household items. (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 139)


Upon returning to Gaythorne Wetcheck Roof Restorations commenced operating out of Gaythorne. She did the filing, organising, recording of work (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraphs 179 and 191).


At the same time she took care of all home duties including cleaning and cooking and gardening, yard maintenance, she designed a company logo and business cards for Wetcheck (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraphs 182, 183). 

159Having regard to the fact the defendant did not drive, I would regard the contributions as equal. 

160In respect of the assaults it seems to me that to the extent that the performance of the defendant's homemaker contributions was affected by the assaults, that fact ought to be taken into account in her favour in assessing them. The plaintiff drew attention to the question of onus in respect of these matters and referred to two cases Kennon (1997) 22 FamLR 1 and Spagnardi [2003] FamCA 905.

161In Kennon it was said at 24 in relation to allegations of violence:

""It is essential to bear in mind the relatively narrow band of cases to which these considerations apply. To be relevant, it would be necessary to show that the conduct occurred during the course of the marriage and had a discernable impact upon the contributions of the other party. It is not directed to conduct which does not have that effect and of necessity it does not encompass (as in Ferguson) conduct related to the breakdown of the marriage (basically because it would not have had a sufficient duration through this impact to be relevant to contributions).

162In Spagnardi it was said:

""An insufficiency of evidence in the present case leaves the court with a limited ability to deal with allegations in the context of Section 79 proceedings. As Kennon has established it is necessary to provide evidence to establish:

The incidence of domestic violence;
The effect of domestic violence; and
Evidence to enable the court to quantify the effects of that violence upon the party's capacity to ""contribute"" as defined by Section 79(4).""

163In the present case the plaintiff has given detailed evidence of the affect that the assaults had on her in each case. However, there is little direct evidence of how that effect on her made her homemaker contributions more difficult. The court is left with a limited ability to make any necessary inferences absent that evidence. Assuming that the fear generated by the incidents had some immediate affect on contributions at the time of affectation, a period of some weeks is of minor significance in the overall time frame of this 15-year relationship. This is particularly so given that there was a substantial break for many years between the incidents. I note that the defendant refers to the continuous effect of the assaults when dealing with damages and I will deal with this later. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest any effect the assaults had on her other non-financial contributions.

164The apprehension, contact and the injuries arising from the assault and battery is another matter. These are serious matters and are no less reprehensible because they occurred within a domestic arrangement. They should be separately treated to show the Court's disapproval of such matters. This course is adopted from time to time in the Family Court. See In the Marriage of Kennon 22 Fam LR 289 at 296 where Coleman J, who was there concerned with exemplary damages said:- 

""This is a case where the message must be spelled out to persons such as the respondent that they cannot assault and beat wives or de facto wives and escape civil liability simply on the basis that it was 'a domestic'. I know of no principle which renders an assault and battery in a domestic context less reprehensible than that in any other context."" 

165I will return to this aspect later.

166It is also appropriate to deal with the other non-financial contributions by the parties.

167The defendant in submissions suggested the following contributions:


When the parties purchased the property at Coldstream St, Yamba, Ms Mulcahy designed the layout of retaining walls and the kitchen, masked windows, spack filled, did all the housework, washing, cooking, cleaning, turf laying, mowing and designed and established the gardens (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 262).


Wayne Dalton and Ms Mulcahy undertook most of the renovations on Oaks Avenue, Casino. Ms Mulcahy cleaned the yard, marked out garden beds, planted mature trees, palms and shrubs (many of which she had propagated at 290 Southbank Road), spread pine bark and put in flowering plants, hemmed and hung the curtains, kept the yard mown (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 361).


In late 2003 when the Removal House purchased for $4,000, Ms Mulcahy positioned the house in the most suitable location, designed the kitchen and bathroom, painted the deck and wide stairs, painted the slats/the bottom portion of the house (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraphs 371, 372).


As a result of extra acres added to the 290 Southbank Road property Ms Mulcahy created further gardens, planted fruit trees, vegies and shrubs, designed all interior renovations (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraphs 379 and 380).


Ms Mulcahy spent more time on the ride-on mower mowing lawns than Cooper did on the tractor (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 389).


Ms Mulcahy's contributions to the Grafton units initially were preparing interiors for tiling, painting and plumbing including cleaning cupboards, bathroom walls, removing mildew and other stains, making concrete pathways, weeding, pruning and fertilising, hemming and installing 70 sets of curtains, furnishing each unit with linen, crockery, cooking utensils and cutlery (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 396).


Ms Mulcahy set the rent at Grafton units at $128 a week for 8 of the units and $132 a week for 4 of the units resulting in fully rented $1,562 per week (affidavit 29 June 2011 paragraph 400).


Ms Mulcahy, in respect of the Ace High Hats business:-

(i)Wrote down the hats that they were short of,
(ii)The ones they had to order,
(iii)Kept close attention to the stock that was available,
(iv)Wrote the list to re-order the stock,
(v)Decided what stock would be ordered.
(vi)Attended warehouse to select stock.
(T178, lines 20 - 35).
168These submissions are not particularly helpful because all they have done is extracted from the relevant paragraphs of her affidavit the work the defendant said she did on her own. They do not include those paragraphs where she said the work was done by the plaintiff or by the plaintiff and her. Accordingly it is somewhat misleading. 

169For example, in respect of the renovations to Yamba the defendant conceded that the plaintiff used tradesmen which were paid for some of the work and that the tradesmen involved did the heavier work. She also conceded that the plaintiff painted the interior of the property using a spray gun. 

170In his responsive affidavit the plaintiff suggested that the design and the layout of retaining walls, garden, kitchen, entertainment unit and wardrobes were joint decisions. He also said the kitchen required no design as it was one cabinet about 2 metres long in a very small house. He also denied the masking of windows and spack filling and pointed out that there were no cornices. 

171There seemed to be a project to renovate a particular property in a short period of time and it seems to me that each party helped on that project and that the contributions were probably equal.

172With regard to Casino and its development the submission omits the defendant's concession that the plaintiff replaced the bathroom taps and they both painted the fence. 

173The plaintiff referred to financial records that only showed one payment of $555 to Wayne Dalton for his work, which according to the plaintiff would be two days' work. He suggests that he did the majority of the work.

174Having regard to the financial records I think that the plaintiff is correct and he did the majority of the work in respect of this property apart from work that was done by various tradesmen who were paid for their work.

175The removal house was purchased for $4,000. According to the plaintiff there was only one place where the house could be located on the block. The defendant conceded that the plaintiff painted the majority of the internal walls after she scrubbed and undercoated them with the assistance of a friend. This seems somewhat doubtful as apparently, according to the plaintiff, the walls were gyprock. The suggestion by the defendant that she painted the large deck may be mistaken given, according to the plaintiff, it remained as bare unpainted timber and on its sale the new owners stained the timber. That could not have happened if it was painted. 

176In my view the plaintiff did the majority of the work on the renovation of the house once it was placed on the property.

177The subdivision in respect of which the defendant says she planted some fruit trees and designed interior renovations was a large project. The work involved in creating the subdivision was extensive and was set out in length by the plaintiff in para 34 of his affidavit dated 22 September 2009. His file concerning the subdivision was tendered and plainly supports his claim that he was the one who did all the work and arranged the subdivision which was of great benefit to the parties. 

178With regard to the ride on lawn mower the submissions do not negate the concession made by the defendant that the plaintiff worked very hard on the farm at times although she said that it was not an all year round effort.

179In his affidavit of 22 September 2009 at para 34 (9) (2) (xiii) the work the plaintiff describes there seems a realistic description as it is substantially heavier and more difficult work than riding a mower. I think there were substantial contributions by the plaintiff in respect of the farm in contrast to the contributions by the defendant. The plaintiff denied these contributions but he does not suggest that he did them. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defendant did them.

180So far as renting the Grafton units I accept that the defendant set the rent which she achieved which was substantially better than the real estate agent's initial estimate. No doubt this is why the units became valuable.

181In respect of the business Ace High Hats it seems clear that both parties contributed equally to this business until they decided to cease business.

182I have already earlier dealt with the driving which the plaintiff had to do because the defendant could not drive. Another matter they both attended to equally was the care and welfare of the defendant's brother George, who was disabled and suffered from cerebral palsy. The plaintiff gave evidence that he contributed to the same degree as the defendant to the care and welfare of George. 

183Given the particular work done on the farm in my view the non-financial contributions I have been discussing, favour the plaintiff over the defendant. 

Claim for adjustment under s 20

184The plaintiff originally claimed a 100% of the parties' property but at the hearing submitted that the assessment of the parties' contributions should result in a division of the parties' property, excluding the lotto proceeds, as to 60% to the plaintiff and 40% to the defendant. However the orders sought by the plaintiff are for a different result, namely a division of the assets of 40% to the plaintiff and 60% to the defendant, and according to the submissions this reflects the instructions of the plaintiff, not the analysis of this case by applying the authorities.

185The defendant for her part seeks an adjustment, which after what she says are appropriate add backs, give her 85% of the parties assets.

Global or asset by asset approach and the erosion principle

186In Norbis v Norbis (1985-1986) 161 CLR 513 at 523 the High Court said the following: 

""Although it is natural to assess financial contributions under s79 (4)(a) by reference to individual assets, it is also natural to assess the contribution of a spouse as homemaker and parent either by reference to the whole of the parties' property or to some part of that property. For ease of comparison and calculation it will be convenient in assessing the overall contributions of the parties at some stage to place the two types of contribution on the same basis, i.e. on a global or, alternatively, on an ""asset-by-asset"" basis. Which of the two approaches is the more convenient will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. However, there is much to be said for the view that in most cases the global approach is the more convenient. It follows that the Full Court is quite entitled to prescribe that approach as a guideline in order to promote uniformity of approach within the Court. In saying this we are not to be understood as denying the legitimacy of the trial judge's ascertainment in the first instance of the financial contributions of the parties by reference to particular assets. It is difficult to conceive how the trial judge in many cases could otherwise take account of such contributions as he is required to by s.79 (4)(a) of the Act . In this respect we agree with the comment of Nygh J. in G and G that, although mathematical precision is certainly not required, there is ordinarily a need to know the circumstances in which assets were acquired and the general extent of each party's contribution to them."" 

187The same considerations which apply to Family Law referred to by the High Court in Norbis v Norbis apply to decisions under the Property (relationships) Act 1984. There are numerous cases dealing with this Act but it is useful to note the following two comments by the Court of Appeal. 

188In Bilous v Mudaliar [2006] NSWCA 38 ; 65 NSWLR 615, Ipp JA outlined the general approach that should be taken in the evaluation of the parties' contributions in the following terms: 

[41] In Davey v Lee (1990) 13 Fam LR 668, McLelland J said at 689: 
""[T]he Court is not required under s 20 to undertake a reductionist process analogous to the taking of partnership accounts (notoriously one of the most time-consuming and expensive of litigious exercises) by examining every alleged 'contribution' of the kinds described in the section with a view to putting a monetary value on it in order to reach an accounting balance one way or the other, which is to be then eliminated by the requisite financial adjustment. Rather the Court is required to make a holistic value judgment in the exercise of a discretionary power of a very general kind."" 
I would endorse this approach as well as his Honour's further observation that, while the parties may value non-material contributions to the welfare of the family more highly than material contributions, these are not matters that lend themselves to detailed examination and analysis by a Court. 
[42] Generally, the Court has a broad discretion in determining the approach to adopt in considering what order to make under s 20(1). As Brereton J (with whom Basten JA and Hunt AJA agreed) said in Kardos v Sarbutt at [51] (relying on Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17; (1986) 161 CLR 513): 
""Although in the majority of cases, the global approach is likely to be more convenient than an asset-by-asset approach, the application of the asset-by-asset approach does not of itself amount to an error of law."" 
Brereton J at [54] observed that: 
""As [ Lenehan v Lenehan [1987] FamCA 8; (1987) 11 Fam LR 615] shows, the principal indicator for an 'asset-by-asset' analysis is discrepant identifiable contributions of the parties to different assets: in that case, the proportionate contribution of the parties to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of the matrimonial home on the one hand, and to the business assets on the other, were quite different. Such an approach will often be contra-indicated where, as here, there has been a pooling of income."" 
[43] If a global approach is adopted, regard must still be had to the origin and nature of the different assets. If an asset-by-asset approach is adopted, care must be taken to avoid the risk of undervaluing domestic and non-financial contributions and regard must be had to the overall result: Kardos v Sarbutt at [51] and [54]. Some situations do not lend themselves either to a pure global approach or to a pure asset-by-asset approach. In some cases the judge may decide to have regard to the particular contributions made to individual assets, weigh up the overall respective contributions to the parties and make differing apportionments in relation to the interests of the parties in different assets. 

189In Separovich v Ferrao [2011] NSWCA 180, Beazley JA (with whom McColl and MacFarlan JJA agreed) stated: 

[36] There are, as might be expected, a plethora of authorities as to how the Court should approach an adjustment of property under s 20. It is sufficient for the purposes of this case to refer to the following. In Manns v Kennedy [2007] NSWCA 217 ; DFC 95-406 Campbell JA (Santow JA and Bryson AJA agreeing) observed, at [62], that under s 20, the Court was required to make a holistic value judgment in the exercise of a discretionary power of a very general kind: see Davey v Lee (1990) 13 Fam LR 688 at 689; Ross v Elderfield [2006] NSWCA 129 ; DFC 95-338 at [35]; Kardos v Sarbutt [2006] NSWCA 111 ; DFC 95-332 at [36]. 

[37] However, that "" holistic value judgment"" is the final step in the process of arriving at an order, being the just and equitable adjustment of property, having regard to the contributions identified in s 20. Before the court can make that final determination, it is necessary to identify and value the property in respect of which it is open to the court to make an adjustment and to identify and value the contributions that are being taken into account: see Howlett v Neilson [2005] NSWCA 149 ; DFC 95-321 at [25]; Saric v Steward [2006] NSWCA 260; (2007) DFC 95 at [61]; Chanter v Catts [2005] NSWCA 411; 64 NSWLR 441 at [22]. 

[38] The authorities recognise that notwithstanding that the court exercises a wide discretion under s 20, a mathematical calculation of the contribution of the parties is of assistance in finding and testing conclusions as to what is just and equitable and in promoting transparency and consistency in decision-making: see Howlett v Neilson per Hodgson JA at [39]. 

[39] The discretionary considerations that may influence and/or determine the ultimate order made depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. As Ipp JA observed in Bilous v Mudaliar [2006] NSWCA 38 ; 65 NSWLR 615 at [63]: 

""Determinations as to what orders should be made under s 20 are to be made solely on the grounds of the justice and equity of the case. The justice and equity of the case may derive from the fact that the party who owns the family home or other property was able to retain that property, while the market value increased, because 'of joint efforts of wage earning, homemaking and parenting, and mutual support'. In some instances the non-financial contributions of one party may result in property of the kind in question not having to be sold. In other instances, the non-financial contributions of one partner may allow the other to advance his or her career and earn a high income that enables the property in question to be maintained and retained. Thus, an increment in capital value may well result, indirectly, from 'joint efforts of wage earning, homemaking and parenting, and mutual support'."" 

190Mathematical calculations, whilst not determinative, cannot be ignored. In Manns v Kennedy [2007] NSWCA 217, Campbell JA (with whom Santow JA and Bryson AJA agreed) stated: 

[64] However, the ""holistic value judgment"" is the final step in the process of arriving at an order, namely deciding what adjustment of property seems just and equitable having regard to the contributions identified in paragraphs (a) and (b). Carrying out the task that section 20 sets requires, before that final step is carried out, an identification and (so far as possible) valuation of the contributions that are being taken into account and an identification and (so far as possible) valuation of the property concerning which it is open to the court to make an adjustment: Howlett v Neilson [2005] NSWCA 149 at [25]; (2005) 33 Fam LR 420 at 407; Saric v Steward [2006] NSWCA 260 at [61]; (2007) DFC 95,401 at 78,713; Chanter v Catts [2005] NSWCA 411 at [22]; (2005) 64 NSWLR 360 at 366. 

[65] Further, even in carrying out that final step, ""there is no warrant for ignoring the rigour that mathematics can provide"": Ross v Elderfield (at [49] per Handley JA (with whom McColl JA and Hislop J agreed)). As Hodgson JA said in Howlett v Neilson (at [39]; 411): 

""... while I do not think that these matters can be determined on such mathematical calculations, I think mathematical calculations are of some use in guiding and testing conclusions about what is just and equitable, and also in promoting transparency and consistency in decision-making."" 

191In this case I will adopt a global approach. This is particularly appropriate given that there is no property which stands apart from their joint endeavours except for Gaythorne. This assett contributed by the defendant was the start of their investment in property which could not have occurred without it. It was owned by the defendant at the commencement of the relationship and was still retained 15 years later when the relatiionship finished.

192As it is the only asset held for the whole relationship I will note the place of the erosion principle in these matters. That principle was discussed in Howlett v Neilson [2005] NSWCA 149 by Hogson JA as follows: 

[30] In addition to the contributions of the parties during a relationship, regard needs also to be had to initial contributions. In cases decided under the Family Law Act, there has developed what is sometimes referred to as ""the erosion principle"". That principle was considered and explained in Pierce. That case concerned a marriage of eight years, preceded by two years' cohabitation. The assets of the parties were found to be $319,190.00. At the time of marriage, the husband had assets to the value of $226,000.00, while the wife had assets with an estimated value of $11,500.00. The trial judge considered the parties' contributions during cohabitation to be equal. He gave some additional weight to the greater initial contribution of the husband, but said that the relevance of this was diminished due to the length of cohabitation, a little over ten years, and the substantial other contributions. He took into account the husband's contribution in caring for the children since separation, and assessed the contributions of the parties to be 55:45 in favour of the husband. The Full Court allowed an appeal, holding that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the contributions of the parties in that he failed to attach sufficient weight to the greater initial contribution of the husband and his post-separation contribution in caring for the children. The Full Court held that, having regard to the facts as found by the trial judge, the result embodied in his reasons was unreasonable; and that in re-exercising the discretion, the contribution to the parties should be assessed at 70% to the husband and 30% to the wife, with a further 5% adjustment in favour of the husband for factors under s 75(2) of the Family Law Act. 
... 
[34] I have found no clear statement concerning the ""erosion principle"" in cases under the Property (Relationships) Act. In my opinion, it is by no means clear that it would apply to the same extent as under the Family Law Act, where matters other than contributions can be taken into account, and where the relationship itself involves a public commitment to mutual support for life (as noted in Evans at 78-79). 

[35] However, it is plainly not the case that the contributions of the parties should be considered as making it just and equitable that there be an order only concerning increases in the value of assets over and above initial contributions. 

193In Kardos v Sarbutt [2006] NSWCA 11, Brereton J referred to some of Hodgson JA's remarks quoted above and commented: 

""...There is no reason why this approach would apply to any less extent under the Property (Relationships) Act than under the Family Law Act; it does not involve taking into account matters other than contributions, but is part of the methodology for weighing and balancing the different contributions. 

[67] Significant factors affecting the application of the ""erosion principle"" are the length of the relationship and, in particular, the extent to which there have been other or off-setting contributions which also have to be satisfied from the available pool. It is to accommodate those contributions that the initial contributions are ""eroded"". 

194In Bilous v Mudaliar Ipp JA (with whom Giles and McColl JJA agreed) was cautious in adopting Brereton J's approach: 

""[68] In Kardos v Sarbutt (at 567 [64]-[66]), Brereton J accepted the ""erosion principle"", regarding it as ""part of the methodology for weighing and balancing the different contributions"" when weighing the initial contributions with all other relevant contributions. There are dangers in elevating a process of reasoning to the status of a principle, and for the reasons I have given I consider it preferable that the erosion principle (as a rule) should play no part in a determination under s 20."" 

195However, his Honour propounded his agreement with Hodgson JA in Howlett v Neilson in relation to the notions which underline the ""erosion principle"": 

""[48] The initial contributions made by parties to a de facto relationship may often take the form of a family home or other assets in the form of immovable property. During the course of the relationship, property may be acquired and registered in the name of one of the parties, alone. The duration of the relationship and the significance of the respective contributions of the parties may lead to a court adjusting the parties' interests in such a way that the party who provides such property (or the party who is the registered owner) receives substantially less than the full value of that property when the relationship is terminated. 

[49] The adjusting order may require the party making the initial contribution (or the party who is the registered owner) to pay the other party a sum of money that represents a proportion of the increase in the capital value of the property concerned or, indeed, its overall value. Hodgson JA emphasised the latter possibility in Howlett v Neilson when he said (at 410 [35]): ""[I]t is plainly not the case that the contributions of the parties should be considered as making it just and equitable that there be an order only concerning increases in the value of assets over and above initial contributions"". (Emphasis added)

196The erosion principle has been discussed in a number of recent cases. In Wendt v Wood [2011] NSWSC 781 Slattery said: 

""[98] In the course of final submissions, counsel...referred me to the so-called "" erosion principle"". Indeed, it is not a principle of law at all but really a short hand description of the approach to the evaluation of contributions which recognises that initial contributions do not carry forward full weight but diminish in significance by reason of the other subsequent contributions made by both parties during the relationship: Sharpless v McKibbin [2007] NSWSC 1498 at [78] per Brereton J. It is not really a question of erosion but of what weight is to be attached in all the circumstances to the initial contributions, in the context of all the contributions.""

197In this case given the use by the parties of the Gaythorne property for borrowing and the benefit of successful joint property investments that flowed from that use I do not see that there is any real reason why the value of that contribution should be diminished.

198The major contribution to the assets of the parties has been their successful property developments. There were joint projects to which they both contributed to different extents as outlined above. Overall the non-financial contributions favour the plaintiff.

199Giving due weight to the contributions of Gaythorne by the defendant, I think an appropriate division is 40% to the plaintiff and 60% to the defendant. The property of the parties, with add backs is $1,605,782. After division of this amount into these proportions and subtracting the applicable add backs, the plaintiff receives $342,313 ($642,313 less $300,000) and the defendant $542,469 ($963,469 less $421,000). 

200Thereafter account should be taken of what other assets have been taken or should be retained by them. These are:






Plaintiff



Defendant




Household contents

$5,000

50% interest in River Road

$67,500


Glassware

$12,500

Art works

$15,000


Janmell

$236,196

Mower

$3,000


Superannuation

$17,000

Glassware

$12,500


Total

$270,696

Total

$98,000


201Deducting these from each party's entitlements referred to above gives the plaintiff $71,617 ($342,313 less $270,696) and the defendant $444,469 ($542,469 less $163,000) of the remaining assets of the parties. 

202The balance of the assets of the parties should be sold, debts paid and the resulting sum distributed to the parties in the proportion set out in the preceding paragraph.

203The defendant made a submission that due to her difficult financial situation she should be paid in cash with the defendant to retain the assets. Given that she will be entitled to her award of damages, which is substantial, this will relieve her financial situation. It is preferable that both parties have an incentive to attend properly to the realisation of their assets.

The defendant's cross claim for assault

204I have found that the following assaults have been proved:

1.The argument in May 1993 (assault);
2.The threat to kill and battery in 1995 (assault and battery);
3.One occasion of ordering the defendant out of the house in 1996 (assault);
4.The beer incident and threat to shoot in December 2000 (assault and battery);
5.Threat to shoot in 2007 (assault).

205The defendant claims damages, aggravated and exemplary damages. However, before considering her claim I must ascertain whether or not her causes of action in relation to each occasion of assault and/or battery are statute barred.

The applicable limitation period

206In relation to all of the incidents except the last incident in 2007, the relevant section in the Limitation Act 1969 is section 18A, which relevantly reads:

""18A Personal injury

(1) This section applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury, but does not apply to: 

(a) ...
(b) ...
(c) a cause of action to which Division 6 applies.

Note. Division 6 provides for the limitation period for non-motor accident actions for death or personal injury resulting from an incident that occurs on or after the commencement of that Division.

(2) An action on a cause of action to which this section applies is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of 3 years running from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff or to a person through whom the plaintiff claims.""

207Campbell J in O'Neill v Foster (2004) 61 NSWLR 499 at [44] confirmed that s 18A is the correct section to apply in a cause of action for assault given the extended definition in s 11 of the Limitation Act 1969 of ""breach of duty"", which includes trespass to the person. By analogy s 18A also governs a cause of action for battery.

208In relation to the 2007 incident, section 18A does not apply. Since the ""act or omission alleged to have resulted in the injury... with which a claim is concerned"" occurred on or after the commencement of Part 2, Division 6 of the Limitation Act 1969, being 6 December 2002, Division 6 governs the cause of action (see s 18A (1)(c) and 50A). 

209Therefore section 50C applies to the cause of action for the assault in 2007. Section 50C is the crucial section in Division 6 for the purposes of these proceedings. The section reads:

""50C Limitation period for personal injury actions

(1) An action on a cause of action to which this Division applies is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of whichever of the following periods is the first to expire: 

(a) the 3 year post discoverability limitation period, which is the period of 3 years running from and including the date on which the cause of action is discoverable by the plaintiff,
(b) the 12 year long-stop limitation period, which is the period of 12 years running from the time of the act or omission alleged to have resulted in the injury or death with which the claim is concerned...""

210Section 50D defines the 'date on which a cause of action is discoverable':

""50D Date cause of action is discoverable

(1) For the purposes of this Division, a cause of action is discoverable by a person on the first date that the person knows or ought to know of each of the following facts: 

(a) the fact that the injury or death concerned has occurred,
(b) the fact that the injury or death was caused by the fault of the defendant,
(c) in the case of injury, the fact that the injury was sufficiently serious to justify the bringing of an action on the cause of action.

(2) A person ought to know of a fact at a particular time if the fact would have been ascertained by the person had the person taken all reasonable steps before that time to ascertain the fact.

(3) In determining what a person knows or ought to have known, a court may have regard to the conduct and statements, oral or in writing, of the person...""

211However the defendant, by her counsel, did not rely on s 50D and did not argue that 'discovery' of her injury occurred at a later date than the date on which the 2007 incident occurred. Furthermore ss 50C and 50D apply only to the 2007 incident, at which time the defendant appears to have previously ""discovered"" the psychological injury that she alleges resulted from the various incidents of assault and/or battery. In any event the defendant is not statute barred in relation to the 2007 incident (see table below).

212I note that counsel for the defendant provided submissions in which section 14 of the Limitation Act 1969 was identified as the appropriate section to apply in relation to incidents occurring between mid-1993 and 2 December 1999. Given that the present s 18A was introduced by the Limitation (Amendment) Act 1990, which commenced on 1 September 1990, I am of the view that s 18A is the correct provision to apply in relation to causes of action for assault and/or battery that occurred between 1 September 1990 and the commencement of Part 2, Division 6 on 6 December 2002. 

213Both sections 18A and 50C legislate a statute bar on a cause of action if an action is ""brought"" after a certain time limit. In relation to when an action is ""brought"", s 74 of the Limitation Act 1969 relevantly states:

""74 Set off etc

(1) Where, in an action (in this section called the principal action), a claim is made by way of set off, counterclaim or cross action, the claim, for the purposes of this Act: 

(a) is a separate action, and
(b) is, as against a person against whom the claim is made, brought on the only or earlier of such of the following dates as are applicable: 
(i) the date on which the person becomes a party to the principal action, and
(ii) the date on which the person becomes a party to the claim...""

214In this case the earlier date on which the plaintiff became a party to the principal action is the date on which the plaintiff's statement of claim was filed, namely 27 August 2008 (see similar reasoning of Campbell J in O'Neill v Foster at [48] to [54]). Therefore, the defendant's cross-claim of assault and battery was ""brought"" on that date.

215I note that counsel for the plaintiff submitted in his written submission that by virtue of s 65 of the Civil Procedure Act the date of the initial filing of the cross-claim, namely 8 April 2009, was the date of commencement of the proceedings for the purposes of determining whether the action is statute barred. I agree that the effect of s 65 is that the amendments to the cross-claim take effect as if they formed part of the original cross-claim filed on 8 April 2009. However, in my view s 65 is not contrary to s 74 of the Limitation Act 1969 so that for the purposes of determining when the action was ""brought"", the relevant date remains the date on which the plaintiff filed the statement of claim. 

216The following table summarises the applicable limitation periods in relation to the five incidents that I have found proved:

Extension of time based on disability (s 52 of the Limitation Act 1969)

217The defendant's causes of action in relation to all incidents except for the 2007 threat to shoot are prima facie statute barred. However, the defendant relied on s 52 of the Limitation Act 1969 to argue that she was suffering a disability and that the running of the limitation period should be suspended for the duration of her disability, namely from 1993 until 9 June 2010 (being the date on which the defendant filed her amended statement of cross-claim). Therefore the three-year limitation period (section 18A) would start from 9 June 2010 and would not expire until 9 June 2013, meaning the actions would be brought well within time. 

218Section 52 states:

""52 Disability

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and subject to section 53, where: 

(a) a person has a cause of action,
(b) the limitation period fixed by this Act for the cause of action has commenced to run, and
(c) the person is under a disability,
in that case: 

(d) the running of the limitation period is suspended for the duration of the disability, and
(e) if, but for this paragraph, the limitation period would expire before the lapse of three years after: 
(i) the date on which the person last (before the expiration of the limitation period) ceases to be under a disability, or
(ii) the date of the person's death,

(whichever date is the earlier), the limitation period is extended so as to expire three years after the earlier of those dates.

(2) This section applies whenever a person is under a disability, whether or not the person is under the same or another disability at any time during the limitation period...""

219Disability is defined in s 11(3) of the Limitation Act 1969. The defendant relies on s 11(3)(b)(i), as follows:

(3) For the purposes of this Act a person is under a disability: 
...
(b) while the person is, for a continuous period of twenty-eight days or upwards, incapable of, or substantially impeded in, the management of his or her affairs in relation to the cause of action in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises, by reason of: 
(i) any disease or any impairment of his or her physical or mental condition...""

220In Kotulski v Attard [1981] 1 NSWLR 115 at 117-118, Slattery J discussed this concept of ""disability"":

""Section 11(3)(b) is concerned with two classes of person: 

'One who is incapable"" (which conveys the concept of total
inability) and the other ""substantially impeded in the management of his affairs in relation to the cause of action ... by reason of disease or impairment or physical or mental condition.'

According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary to ""impede"" means to
obstruct in progress or action; to hinder or to stand in the way of.
""Substantially"", in my view, does not mean trivial or minimal, neither does it mean total: see R v Lloyd [1967] 1 QB 175. ""Mental condition"" which is not defined in the Act is, in my view, a condition of or pertaining to the mind which is the seat of consciousness, thoughts, volition and feelings. It seems to me that the expression ""mental condition"" is meant to cover the mind's activities in all its aspects, including the ability to form a rational judgment, or to exercise willpower to control physical acts in accordance with rational judgment (...) I am of opinion that it is a relevant matter, in the consideration of the question raised by the notice of motion, to have regard to how a reasonable person without any impairment would conduct himself in the management of his affairs. A reasonable person without impairment would be able to reason normally about the matters relevant to a potential cause of action, to understand and consider advice and to give instructions about any action.""

221The above comments were approved by the Court of Appeal in Olive v Johnstone [2006] NSWCA 21 at [61] and in New South Wales v Harlum [2007] NSWCA 120 at [61]. 

222In Kotulski v Attard, Slattery J found that a plaintiff suffering from a ""depressive state with some hysterical features (...) that impaired her volition and judgment"" was suffering from a ""disability"" for the purposes of suspending the limitation period.

223In Saunders v Jackson [2009] NSWCA 192, Hoeben J (with whom Ipp and Macfarlan JJA agreed) said that ""a consideration of this question [whether a person is substantially impeded in the management of the cause of action] must have regard to the nature of the particular cause of action"". His Honour said that a decision to commence an action after an industrial accident or a motor vehicle accident would be relatively straightforward, in contrast to the case before him, being an allegation of sexual assault within a family. In this case, the decision to bring an action in the context of domestic violence, against a de facto partner, could not be said to be ""relatively straightforward"".

224In New South Wales v Harlum Beazley JA (with whom Tobias JA agreed) emphasised the affect that a person's mental condition might have on the willpower to commence proceedings, at [94] - [95]:

""[94] The State's approach also fails to deal with another of the other fundamental aspects of bringing a claim, namely that it requires the exercise of willpower to initiate the claim: see Kotulski at 118. In this regard, I consider that it is important to understand that it is not only a question of having the willpower to engage in the task of commencing proceedings. Such an approach takes a far too simplistic view of what is involved in the commencement of an action. In making a decision to commence an action, the person is also making a decision to continue with the claim.

[95] Even if a person is able to fulfil each of the requirements contained in the State's approach, including the making of a decision to instruct a lawyer and to provide instructions, the person may not have the willpower to engage in all that is required to commence an action because of that person's mental condition.""

225In this case the defendant alleges that because of her pleaded injuries she has been under a disability from 1993 through to the last of the pleaded assaults and continuing. The pleaded injuries are post traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder and/or mixed anxiety depressive syndrome.

Whether the defendant suffers from a disability (medical evidence)

226This requires a consideration of the medical evidence to determine the effect of not only the assaults but also the statements on other occasions which although not constituting in themselves an assault, may be relevant to a medical opinion about the defendant's disability.

227The defendant initially sought to lead evidence from Dr Godsall a consultant psychiatrist. Five of his initial reports were not admitted into evidence but his report of 26 July 2011 was admitted and in that report he diagnosed the defendant in these terms:

"" I diagnosed that Ms Mulcahy is suffering from PTSD as a result of exposure to chronic situational stress, bullying, threatened violence, verbal violence and derogatory, demeaning and trivialising comments and, along with the foregoing history, symptoms and signs consistent with a significant emotional reaction of great intensity if the situation in which she found herself was traumatic for her.""

228The parts of the report which dealt with when she commenced suffering from that disability were rejected for the reasons which I gave when admitting the report Exhibit 4.

229The defendant also called evidence from a Dr Kraushaar who is a psychologist. He also made a diagnosis of PTSD and probably an adjustment disorder. The evidence would suggest that these are in fact psychiatric diagnoses, which should only be made by a qualified psychiatrist. He treated her inter alia by eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR).

230During the hearing the defendant also lead evidence from a Dr Robert Fisher a consultant psychiatrist who diagnosed possible PTSD and a major depressive disorder (the later of which was in remission whilst she was taking avanza). He also gave evidence that she was suffering a disability within s 52 of the Limitation Act 1969 ""from the earliest time in the relationship"". Dr Fischer had also been her treating psychiatrist.

231The plaintiff called evidence from Dr Peter Klug a forensic psychiatrist. He gave evidence that in his opinion the defendant was not suffering from any severe psychiatric condition and certainly not PTSD or a major depressive disorder. According to him she has probably suffered at times from an adjustment disorder. He also addressed the medical evidence called by the defendant.

232During the course of the relationship the defendant was treated for many years by her GP a Dr Wong. He referred her to Dr Kraushaar on 21 June 2007 shortly before the termination of the relationship. She was first referred to Dr Fischer for treatment on 5 January 2010.

Dr Kraushaar (called by the defendant)

233Dr Kraushaar is an experienced psychologist. He initially graduated in 1975 and obtained his PhD in Applied Psychology from the University of Otago (Dunedin Medical School). He has practised as a clinical psychologist since that time in New Zealand, USA and now in Brisbane, Australia. In addition he has trained in Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) in 2009 which he uses in conjunction with his practice as a psychologist. He has worked as a clinical psychologist treating service personnel suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.

234As I have mentioned Dr Kraushaar first saw Mrs Mulcahy on 6 July 2007. At that time she was treated for symptoms of tension and insomnia. He saw her again on 14 March 2008. In October 2008 there was a second management plan in which Mrs Mulcahy was again referred to Dr Kraushaar for a stressful situation, depression and anxiety. She continued her treatment with Dr Kraushaar in 2008 and 2009. 

235On 15 September 2009 Dr Kraushaar wrote to the defendant and the lawyers asking them to take Mrs Mulcahy's mental health into consideration during the possible mediation process and made suggestions on how the mediation could be conducted. He said that at that stage he thought that the diagnosis of battered wife syndrome was relevant. He also said:

""Indeed, at its worst, this man threatened you, 'to get out of his sight'. otherwise he would kill you. "" Such threats over time raise the issue of PTSD over an extended period of months which are exceedingly damaging for anyone's mental health.""

236This is the first time that Dr Kraushaar has suggested the existence of PTSD. I note that the statement of claim that commenced the proceedings was filed on 27 August 2008 and a defence was filed on 8 April 2009. In his report of 19 February 2010 Dr Kraushaar diagnosed PTSD. 

237As I have mentioned Dr Kraushaar does not hold psychiatric qualifications and Dr Klug, a psychiatrist, expressed the view that for this reason Dr Kraushaar was not qualified to express an opinion about the existence of PTSD. Dr Fischer was critical of the use of the manual by those not having Psychiatric qualifications.

238In these circumstances I do not think I can accept Dr Kraushaar's diagnosis. 

239No doubt Dr Kraushaar's treatment of the defendant with EMDR in conjunction with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may have been of assistance. At that stage the EMDR was deferred so it would not interfere further with the defendant giving her evidence. In his last report of 6 July 2011 Dr Kraushaar himself indicated that the treatment for EMDR together with cognitive behaviour therapy should continue and that she would require supervision from a psychiatrist for the management of medication issues until she ceased the need for antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication. He does not give any evidence relevant to the time of the onset of her disability and from what he says she was then suffering.

Dr Godsall (called by the defendant)

240Dr RR Godsall, consultant psychiatrist, obtained his qualifications in the 1970s. He has practised extensively in the United Kingdom and Australia. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a Fellow of the Institute of Australian Psychiatrists.

241As I mentioned in my introduction only one of Dr Godsall's six reports was admitted into evidence. Although in his report he does refer to his earlier reports the one that was admitted is mainly a stand-alone report. However, as I have noted, he does not give any admissible evidence as to when the defendant may have been suffering from a disability within the meaning of the Act.

242Dr Peter Klug, forensic psychiatrist, points out in his reports that the conclusion reached by Dr Godsall, namely, that the defendant suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder or an adjustment disorder is not appropriate. He explains that these are very different illnesses. Dr Klug states that a post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe psychiatric illness whereas an adjustment disorder is a mild one. The symptoms on which Dr Godsall relied and which are set out in paragraph 17 of his report dated 24 March 2010 are according to Kr Klug not compatible with a diagnosis of a post-traumatic stress disorder.

243One of the problems in assessing the usefulness of Dr Godsall's report is that he was not supplied with the notes of the GP. Another is that he has kept no notes of his interview(s) with the defendant as he destroyed them. This makes it difficult to check on the basis of his opinion.

244Early in cross-examination Dr Godsall was taken to an extract from the DSM-IV-TR in the diagnostic psychiatric manual produced by the American Psychiatrists Association. In particular he was taken to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD which are as follows:

""Diagnostic criteria for 309.81 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

A. The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present:

(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others
(2) the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Note: in children, this may be expressed instead by disorganized or agitated behaviour

B. The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one (or more) of the following ways:

(1) recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event, including images, thoughts, or perceptions. Note: In young children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the trauma are expressed.
(2) recurrent distressing dreams of the event. Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.
(3) acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring (includes a sense of reliving the experience, illusions, hallucinations, and dissociative flashback episodes, including those that occur on awakening or when intoxicated). Note: In young children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur.
(4) intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event
(5) physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event

C. Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness (not present before the trauma), as indicated by three (or more) of the following:

(1) efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma
(2) efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma
(3) inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma
(4) markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities
(5) feeling of detachment or estrangement from others
(6) restricted range of affect (e.g., unable to have loving feelings)
(7) sense of a foreshortened future (e.g., does not expect to have a career, marriage, children, or a normal life span)

D. Persistent symptoms of increased arousal (not present before the trauma), as indicated by two (or more) of the following:

(1) difficulty falling or staying asleep
(2) irritability or outbursts of anger
(3) difficulty concentrating
(4) hypervigilance
(5) exaggerated startle response

E. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criteria B, C, and D) is more than 1 month.

F. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify if:

Acute: if duration of symptoms is less than 3 months 
Chronic: if duration of symptoms is 3 months or more

Specify if:

With Delayed Onset: if onset of symptoms is at least 6 months after the stressor""

245The initial requirement for diagnosing PTSD is that described in paragraph A. This raises real questions in this case because none of the events involved actual death or serious injury although some of them related to threatened death. 

246When the cross-examination came to this point Dr Godsall indicated that he used the criteria in the manual with modern variations. He was asked about the variations in this extract of the transcript:

Q. Well, in coming to your diagnosis, did you use this criteria or did you use something else?
A. No, this criteria with the modern variations.

Q. You used this criteria with variations, you say?
A. Mmm.

Q. And what variations?
A. Mainly on the - well, basically the only variation was really on the nature of the stressor and the increased subjectivity. If I may explain this paragraph here, this is from the world - this is from God. This is the new Bible. Glen Gabbard, Professor at Harvard and Menninger. The DCM-IV criteria--

Q. I am sorry, can I just stop you there, doctor. We didn't get the name?
A. Glen Gabbard, Professor Gabbard, G-A-B-B-A-R-D. Sorry. Right?

Q. Well, you got it from Dr Gabbard?
A. Professor Gabbard.

Q. Professor Gabbard, I should say, and in respect of Professor Gabbard's book, did you use or rely on any part of it and, if so, could you identify which part you used?
A. Well, it is covered in this paragraph:

""The DSM-IV criteria focused primarily on circumscribed traumatic
events. They do not capture the more complex form of PTSD in
which the victim may be subjected to prolonged or repeated trauma whilst in captivity or under the total control of the perpetrator. Whereas this syndrome may co-exist with more simple forms of PTSD, a variety of symptoms extend beyond the DSM-IV.""

And he goes on to just set possible symptoms.

Q. Just stopping you there, doctor. You don't list this reference anywhere in your report, do you?
A. No, I don't, I am sorry. I don't think so, no. I did on one report give Gabbard as a reference. I am not quite sure which date it was.

Q. I am just talking about one report.

A. Yeah.

Q. There is no mention in that report of Professor Gabbard at all, I suggest?
A. I can only explain that as bad habits because that's normally the accepted thing these days in the--

Q. Doctor, we are looking at your report--
A. Mmm mmm.

Q. --which has been provided to me which I have sought to read and understand and in respect of your diagnosis, I took it that you relied upon the criteria set out in the document in front of you?
A. That, plus - that plus other knowledge and experience. We don't normally quote the other knowledge and experience because it is assumed that there is variations and DSM-IV is very heavily criticised.

Q. Where are your caveats--
A. My caveats are in the--

Q. --to the criteria in--
A. My caveats are in the degree--

Q. Can I finish the question, please?
A. --of the stressor.

Q. Can I finish the question?
A. Sorry, yes.

Q. Where are the caveats in your report regarding the use of DSM-IV-TR 309.81 post-traumatic stress disorder criteria?
A. I didn't feel the need to specify that. I didn't feel the need to specify that. Because my experience in recent years as an expert witness, I have been able to explain the variations and the restrictions of DSM-IV?

Q. Well, it is not explained in your report, is it?
A. No, because it has been accepted for granted. That's why they are going to DSM-V.

Q. And you understood that this report was a forensic report for the purpose of these proceedings?
A. It's not my understanding of forensic. Forensic to me is - is an offender. Sorry, a psychiatric patient who is an offender. I haven't seen anybody here who is an offender. It's an ordinary psychiatric report.

Q. It is not a forensic psychiatric report?
A. Not in my understanding of the word ""forensic"".

Q. Not a medical legal report?
A. Medicolegal, yes.


247Unfortunately I was not taken to any further explanation by Dr Godsall of what was said to be the modern variations on the standard manual in this area. This makes it extremely hard to accept Dr Godsall's opinion when one does not have the full information for the basis of his opinion.

Dr Fisher (called by the defendant)

248Dr Robert Fisher obtained his qualifications as a consultant psychiatrist in the mid 1970s. He is currently Head of Department of Psychiatry, St Vincent's Clinic and he is a consultant to the private and general hospital. 

249As I have mentioned one of his diagnoses was possible PTSD. He was criticised in at least two areas in respect of his report. The first was in January 2010 he did on one occasion act as the treating psychiatrist for Mrs Mulcahy and later he gave a report, which has been used in this hearing. There are ethical guidelines of the Royal Australian, New Zealand College of Psychiatrists which suggest:

""The psychiatrist should avoid being placed in a situation in which there are both therapeutic and medical legal aspects to the assessment the psychiatrist should advise the patient/lawyer/referring doctor that these two aspects of management should be carried out by different psychiatrists. This does not preclude a psychiatrist from providing a treating doctor's report for a patient already under his or her care."" 

250The situation that Dr Fisher found himself in was slightly unusual in that he was called by the solicitor, Mr A Connolly, who was concerned about whether Mrs Mulcahy was suicidal and needed an urgent assessment from a psychiatrist on that aspect. It is clear that when Mr Connolly was arranging this with Dr Fisher he also made it known that he would want a medico-legal certificate and a report at a later stage. There was only this one time when Dr Fisher was the defendant's treating doctor and it will be evident that most of the treatment was from Dr Kraushaar and Dr Wong. Having heard Dr Fisher's explanation I am satisfied that his position when giving his medico-legal opinion was not compromised. 

251It was also pointed out that in his first report, when Dr Fisher reported to Mr Connolly about the then state of mind of the defendant, he did not make any reference to PTSD. In cross-examination Dr Fisher conceded that he did not ask about PTSD and the reasons he gave were logical. He was focused on anxiety and depression and the potential for the defendant to be suicidal which was the immediate cause of the referral to him. I do not place any great significance on the fact that he did not recognise the possibility of PTSD in his first report.

252It is to be noted that Dr Fisher was not definitive in his diagnosis of PTSD but only describes it as possible. 

Dr Klug (called by the plaintiff)

253Dr Peter Klug was a Fellow of the Royal Australia & New Zealand College of Psychiatrist in 1987. He has positions as a visiting medical officer and consultant at the Mood Disorders Unit, Northside Clinic and a number of other appointments. His current appointments include being a member of the New South Wales Mental Health Review Tribunal. He practises extensively in the medico-legal area.

254Dr Klug was asked to review the defendant which he did over two interviews spread a month or two apart. At the two interviews the defendant was accompanied by Dr Kraushaar who remained throughout the interviews which were recorded.

255One criticism of Dr Klug was the fact that prior to the first interview he did not read the extensive affidavits of the defendant which had been provided to him. However, he read them before the second interview. I also note that Kr Klug repeatedly tried in a non-leading or confrontational way to get the defendant give him her story in the interviews which she tried to avoid by referring him to her affidavits. 

256Dr Klug was also criticised about his denunciation of the EMDR as not being evidence based technique. It was suggested to him that EMDR was used and recommended as a treatment in a number of clinical practice guidelines in treatment for PTSD. His view, which was not shaken, was that EMDR may be combined frequently with other therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and more likely CBT is the useful treatment, which has the successful result. His reasoning in respect to the literature to which he was taken I would accept.

257The view that Dr Klug holds is no doubt based upon his experience and what he sees as the use of EMDR now in mainstream psychiatry. His evidence is that it is little used in clinical practice by psychiatrists and in established psychiatric institutions.

258There were other criticisms of Dr Klug relating to errors in his report but I do not regard them of significance.

Analysis of medical evidence

259The question of whether the defendant is suffering or has suffered from PTSD has attracted a range of different medical opinions. In the absence of a full explanation from Dr Godsall about the basis for his assessment, I am left with the views of Dr's Klug and Fisher with Dr Fischer not being definitely able to diagnose the condition. Given the nature of the traumatic events in this case it is understandable that he should have that reservation. I am not satisfied that the defendant is suffering or has suffered from PTSD.

260The more difficult question is whether her illnesses are such as fall within the criteria in s 52 of the Limitation Act 1969. Dr Fischer gave the following relevant evidence on this aspect in answer to questions put to him by the defendant's solicitor:

""OPINION
In your letter of instruction, dated June 15, 2011, you pose a number of specific questions and I shall answer these seriatim, as you have indicated, basing my opinion on the balance of probability.
You ask -
If Mrs Mulcahy suffers from a disability according to the definition of disability, provided by Section 52. The Limitations Act 1960 (NSW) provides limits on the time within which legal proceedings may be instituted.
Section 52 of the Act provides that where a person has a cause of action and the limitation period fixed by the Act, as commenced to run, a person is under a ""disability"", the running of the limitation period is suspended for the duration of that ""disability"".
For the purpose of Section 52, ""disability"" is defined by Section 11(3) of the Act, which provides that a person is under a disability:
while the person is under the age of 18 years, or
while the person is, for a continuous period of 28 days or upwards, incapable of, or substantially impeded in, the management of his or her affairs, in relation to the cause of action in respect of the limitation period in which the question arises, by reason of:
(i) Any disease or any impairment of her physical or mental condition.
This definition of disability requires that, if the Section 52 exception is to apply, Mrs Mulcahy must have suffered from an incapacity or a substantial impediment in the management of her affairs, because of a disease or an impairment of her mental condition.
The disability that is relevant is one that renders Mrs Mulcahy incapable of, or substantially impeded in, the management of her affairs, including instituting legal proceedings for assault and battery.
You tell told me that ""Court of Appeal of New South Wales has concluded that the inquiries made under Sub-Section ll(3)(b) is directed to determining whether a person is able to reason normally about the matters relevant to a potential course of action, to understand and consider advice and to give instructions about any action that a fundamental aspect of bringing a claim was that it required the exercise of willpower to initiate the claim, and to continue with the claim (State of New South Wales v Harlum [2007] NSWCA120)"". 


Furthermore, you say ""Section ll(3)(b) has also been held to be concerned with different classes of persons - those who were ""incapable"" (which conveys the concept of total incapacity), and those who were ""substantially impeded in the management of his affairs in relation to the cause of action by reason of disease or impairment of physical or mental condition"".
You go on to say that ""mental condition"" covers the mind's activities in all its aspects, including the ability to form a rational judgement, or to exercise willpower to control physical acts in accordance with rational judgement. It is a relevant matter, in the consideration of the question, to have regard to how a reasonable person, without any impairment, would conduct him or herself in the management of his or her affairs (KOTULSKI v ATTARD [1981], NSWLR115).

1.It is my view, that, to a significant extent, Mrs Mulcahy was in ""thrall"" to Mr Cooper, whom she had found charming and good company and pleasant initially to her children and initially a good sexual partner, but who, over a passage of months from the beginning of their relationship, demonstrated himself to be jealous of her relationship with her two sons, extremely needy of attention, irascible and then increasingly, with the passage of time, was allegedly verbally abusive in the extreme, prone to using the worst of expletives in the English lexicon and threatening her with physical violence and, again, allegedly', as pointed out in her affidavit, subjecting her to physical violence at times and, in the context of owning two rifles, engendering in her a realistically-based fear of a potential threat to her life. 


The individual's own view of their relationship, their own observations of their family of origin relationships, their experiences of earlier relationships, particularly sexualised relationships as they go through their various developmental phases and stages, the chemistry of the relationship and the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance all have their part to play. 

Often enough, the ""battered woman"", if indeed that is the victim, will state that the abuser is so remorseful after it has happened, there are explanations in the abuser's childhood for them having poor temper control, having been abused themselves, or how much they feel their abuser needs them, the desire to keep an integrated marriage or family and the investment of time and emotion that has been made by the abused in the relationship, are cited as rationalisations for staying in the relationship. 

I believe there is clear evidence that most of these elements have had their part to play in Mrs Mulcahy's decision to stay on in the relationship, made worse by her decreasing sense of self-confidence, attractiveness and capacity to live a life alone.

So, I do believe that Mrs Mulcahy was suffering from a disability, according to the definition of ""disability"" provided by Section 52.

2. I believe that her primary condition was a Mixed Anxiety Depressive syndrome, induced by Mr Cooper's stress-producing verbal and physical abuse, which manifested insidiously initially and then became more profound with the passage of time.

I believe that, in this state, Mrs Mulcahy's confidence and her ability to assert herself was so significantly impaired, and she had become so pathologically dependent on Mr Cooper, that she was not capable, on the balance of probability, of making rational decisions about whether or not to stay with him, whether or not to report his abusive behaviour to the police.

3.I believe, on the balance of probability, that from the earliest time in the relationship, she was substantially impeded in her ability to manage her affairs. I would posit her failure to take a stand against Mr Cooper's domineering behaviour, particularly with respect to his criticisms of her son, manifest in the first year of her relationship with him, and was marked by the departure of her son, David, from the family home. In permitting this to occur, she surrendered her loyalty to her son, to her commitment to her relationship with Mr Cooper, and it would appear that he then exercised a ""svengali-like"" influence upon her, so that, despite his extreme abusive behaviour, she remained in the relationship.

4. You ask -
Has the condition or conditions been continuous since its first manifestation?
(ii)You ask if such ""substantial impediment/disability"" is not continuing, then in my opinion, on the balance of probabilities, would such impediment/disability have persisted down to the time when Mrs Mulcahy in fact was able to obtain legal advice and understanding of, and an ability to pursue, her rights in respect of the assaults and battery?

It is my view that Mrs Mulcahy experienced an insidious deterioration in her capacity to assert herself in this very unequal relationship with Mr Cooper and, in her increasingly anxious and depressed and unconfident state, was not able to take a stand against what was extreme and unreasonable behaviour.
I believe that it is only since she separated from Mr Cooper that she was able to fully appreciate the extent and severity of his abusive behaviour, and I do believe that this persisted down to the time that Mrs Mulcahy was in fact able to obtain legal advice and an understanding of, and ability to pursue, her rights, in respect of the assaults and battery.

5. You ask -
Is the condition, or conditions, still being suffered by Mrs Mulcahy?

Mrs Mulcahy is no longer living with Mr Cooper, so she is no longer directly subject to his ongoing verbal and physical abuse, however, the impact of those years, during which she was subject to such abuse, would appear to have left their mark on her psychologically and emotionally, and his actions in the legal context serve as persisting assault.
It is my view then that the condition suffered by Mrs Mulcahy persists in that context.

6. You ask -
How did the condition, or conditions, affect Mrs Mulcahy's management of her affairs, in relation to the cause of action for assault and battery, in particular, alleged assaults or battery specified in Paragraph 13 above.

I have already indicated that I believe that Mrs Mulcahy became so anxious and depressed and lacking in self-confidence, remaining ""in thrall"" of Mr Cooper, that she was not able to think rationally about the situation she found herself in, or to assert herself appropriately by either leaving Mr Cooper, seeking an AVO, or reporting him to the police and having him charged with assault and battery.

7.You ask -
Did the condition, or conditions, in particular render her incapable of, or substantially impeded, the management of her affairs, in relation to each of the assaults and batteries inflicted upon her?

I believe, on the balance of probability, that she was caught up in a particular frame of mind, desperately hoping that the relationship would be salvageable and that the once-charming and considerate de facto husband would once again display such apparent loving and considerate behaviour. The fact that, during her time with him, she experienced a degree of intermittent reinforcement of the idea that he was a suitable companion, by demonstrating care and expressing a wish to re-engage with her, even after the various periods of separation, that she was caught up emotionally in the hope that such a meaningful resumption of the original style of relationship would occur.

8. You ask -
Is it reasonable, having regard to her then condition, that Mrs Mulcahy was incapacitated, as set forth under Paragraph 6 (a)(1) of the Amended Statement of Cross-Claim Past Economic Loss?

I believe that it is reasonable, having regard to her then condition, that Mrs Mulcahy was incapacitated, as set forth.

9. You ask -
Similarly, would Mrs Mulcahy likely have been unable to carry out the work described in Paragraph 6 (a) (Hi) of the Amended Statement of Cross-Claim?

I believe that this is, on the balance of probability, likely to be true.

10.You ask-
Would I further provide my opinion, again, on the balance of probabilities only, as to whether it is likely that Mrs Mulcahy's current incapacity for work will continue into the future and, if so, is this probably the case on an indefinite basis?

I do not believe that it is likely that Mrs Mulcahy's current incapacity for work will continue into the future, if she engages in appropriate psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic management of her Mixed Anxiety Depressive condition, and particularly if there is a favourable outcome to her Cross-Claim.

In the event that she fails to be successful in her Cross-Claim, I believe it will be tantamount to driving the final nail into the coffin of her self-confidence and her sense of fairness, in the face of the abuse to which she has allegedly been subjected to by Mr Cooper.

11.You ask-
What are the prospects, if any, of her returning, during the remainder of her prospective working life, to any gainful employment and, if so, in what measure?

As I have indicated above, I believe that with the correct intervention and with what is perceived as a fair outcome of the legal proceedings, she could return to gainful employment, subject to her successful response to treatment. The latter of course is yet to occur and is beyond definite prognostication at this stage.

261As noted above Dr Klug says:

""My opinion is that Ms. Mulcahy is not suffering from any severe psychiatric condition. She certainly has not been suffering from a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder or a major depressive disorder. She has probably suffered, at times, from an adjustment disorder. An adjustment disorder is not a major mood disturbance but is nevertheless a significant psychiatric entity characterized by excessive distress and/or dysfunction in response to a specific stressor or stressors. If Ms. Mulcahy has suffered from an adjustment disorder (chronic or intermittent) it would need to be specified what the stressors were that induced this condition. To my knowledge, and from the history Ms. Mulcahy provided at interview, there has been no exposure to traumatic stressors. I note she is being medicated with an antidepressant and a minor tranquillizer and this is compatible with the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder. ""

262In response to Dr Fischer's report he says:

""ln summary, there is nothing in the further documentation by Dr. Fisher to justify any change in my opinion, I do not believe Ms, Mulahy is suffering from a disability under the relevant Section, 1 do not believe she is, or has been, suffering from a major psychiatric disorder but may have suffered from a recurrent adjustment disorder. The terms ""battered woman"" and '""battered wife syndrome"" are, in my view, not appropriately applied to Ms. Mulcahy given that there is a connotation of severe psychiatric illness.""

263There was also criticism of the use by Dr Fischer of the terms ""Mixed Anxiety Depressive syndrome"". His explanation which I find acceptable was as follows:

""""Q. In that report Dr Klug seeks to criticise your diagnosis by stating that mixed anxiety depressive syndrome is not to be found in DSM-IV. What is your comment on that statement?
A. Strictly speaking, he is correct, it isn't found in the diagnostic entity in DSM-IV. It is found in the preliminary drafts of DSM-V, which is the successor of DSM-IV. In reality people have argued very strongly that this is a useful way of characterising the sort of disorder I believe Mrs Mulcahy suffered from because there is a such a mixture of anxiety and depression which describes
where the patient is experiencing. Furthermore, may have etiological implications. In other words, often enough severe depression is preceded by being very stressed and anxious. One of the aims of the DSM system is to try and put things into categories can be tested and can end up understanding
causes by virtue of that classification or we find out what we classify as separate entities are the same entity. There is some scientific and logical basis to this approach. So in summary the term mixed anxiety depression is something many many people work in psychiatry would use as diagnosis and is about to become a official diagnosis in DSM-V and Dr Klug is correct it is not
in the current literature. He is correct in that. I think the point I am making qualifies why I am putting it in.

264Some things about the parties' relationship raise doubts about whether Dr Fischer's conclusions may be correct. Obvious ones are the fact that the defendant was a relatively high functioning individual throughout the relationship and another is the long periods of time between the assaults. In the plaintiff's submissions in reply he makes the following points:

""7.6 The point made at paragraph 154 of the earlier submissions which goes totally unremarked upon in the Defendant's submissions that a period of more than six years passes between the allegation at item 9 of the schedule of alleged assaults occurring in the Christmas/New Year period of 2000/2001 and the next chronological allegation which is item 3 occurring in March/April 2007. This fact comprehensively debunks the repeated suggestions of the Defendant's submissions that there is some ""continuum"" of abuse. 

7.7 The impressive list of examples of conduct of the Defendant which demonstrate a lack of fear or intimidation including (in addition to the matters mentioned above):
7.7.1 Camping in seemingly remote places; T354.28
7.7.2 Choosing to live in the isolated location at South Bank Road. It is instructive to consider just some of the evidence on this aspect. The evidence of the Defendant herself starting at T215.04 that, at least at the time of the purchase of 290 South Bank Road in late 1999 and the farm in late 2003: 
(a) she had no concerns about living there with the Plaintiff; 
(b) this in circumstances where she was dependent on him to drive her anywhere away from the property; and
(c) and, at T217.11, at the time the parties were looking to purchase 290 South Bank property (in late 1999), she had no concerns about her personal safety or physical situation;
7.7.3 Pressing the Plaintiff to live at South Bank Road despite his initial lack of interest in purchasing that property;
7.7.4 The fact that she went shooting with the Plaintiff with a spotlight; T341.19
7.7.5 The dealings with Gaythorne and the purchase by the MFT of the Mitchelton property to assist David's wife buy a different house;
7.7.6 The pay out of the River Road loan after the Plaintiff had expressly declined to sign the documents required to be signed in this regard (see par 50.9 of the earlier submissions, par 502 of the Defendant's Affidavit of 29 June 2011 and T183.4);
7.7.7 The secret rental receipts from River Road and related CBA accounts;
7.7.8 The trip to Vanuatu in late 2007 post the date the Defendant alleges was separation;
7.7.9. The trip to Bribie Island;
7.7.10. Her control of the $55,000 loan to Wade (David Mulcahy's evidence was that he was not involved with this loan (T437.17 to 21) nor knew the details of the rent receipts of River Road (T417.47 to 418.09 and 427.18 to 36) and Wade Mulcahy's evidence was also that he did not know the details of the rent receipts of River Road (T113.22 to 31), which evidences the degree of involvement in these matters of the Defendant;
7.7.11 Her control and separateness in keeping the inheritance account. It should be noted that the inheritance was a modest amount of some $16,000, so that there is no credence in the suggestion by the Defendant that there is a basis for the separateness of these monies."" 

265Interestingly on the long time between the assaults Dr Fischer said:

""Q. And in terms of the third category, those incidents would need to be constant, I think, is the word you used in the report. That is, there's this constant apprehension of being killed, maimed, or persons close to them being killed or maimed. Is that so?
A. Yes, it is.

Q. And if there were periods of many years without these incidents, that would be relevant to your assessment of the illness if there were periods of time where there were normal behaviour?

A. Well, interestingly, it actually generally works in the obverse way to that because what we know is that intermittent reinforcement in behaviour therapy is the most powerful way of reinforcing an idea or a feeling. So if indeed the acts - the actual acts of violence are unpredictable but do occur intermittently,
then that is more likely to engender fear and a sense of impotence in the face of the ongoing situation than where there are mild degrees of assault happening very regularly and predictably.""

266So far as the defendant's high functionality is concerned, he said:

""Q. Sorry, doctor, there is a matter Mr Priestley has reminded me. In respect of managing her affairs, that is Mrs Mulcahy's affairs, in terms of the history where she was involved with real estate and with various businesses of the parties during the relationship, and continued to do so up until separation; that is able to deal with banks on her own behalf or whatever. She, in those circumstances, can I suggest to you, appear to have any disability in reporting matters or making complaint in respect of what she now complains of in affidavits as to how she was abused. What I am suggesting to you is, she, throughout the time of the relationship, was able to hold her own and appear to operate as a normal person would in a relationship with its normal ups and
downs. That's not your understanding?


A. Well, I think clearly to make it simplistic or we can try and tease out the various factors that have contributed to this complex situation. I guess the most important thing in my mind is, where it came to doing things that involved strongly asserting herself against a man who she felt ambivalent about did she make a sensible decision, such as taking out an AVO; no, she didn't as far as I know. Did not make that sensible decision, despite being advised to do so. So, the concept of being in thrall to someone implies that when it comes to matters that have to do with either saying things or doing things that could harm the other, which logically she should have done on the basis of what she is telling us she didn't do it. Why not? To try and understand why not is part of the psychology of the whole situation. Why did she not do the sensible thing?

Q. And there is an answer to this. That is she has exaggerated or taken out of context matters that have happened in her relationship for financial gain?


A. Well, the things she reports to me that were said to her and done strike me as being beyond the normal, beyond the healthy. As I tried to allude to previously, she didn't seem to me to take the opportunity to grossly exaggerate things when she could have.""

267These responses seem to me to quite reasonable. It should not be forgotten that a lot of the abuse is said to be continuous, see the evidence in respect of the abusive language in 1993. Exhibit P in the proceedings is a collection of emails between the parties after separation. They contain many emails from the defendant using expletives and direct sexual references which made Dr Fischer blush. This is put forward to play down the effect of the language used by the plaintiff. However it seems to me that they are in a limited time frame and probably said in the protective environment of emails and distance between the parties.

268But what of the contrary opinion of Dr Klug? His interview with the defendant was made difficult in that she continually referred him to her affidavit instead of answering his enquiries about any assaults. He described the results in these terms:

""On specific and persistent enquiry about the history of assaults in the relationship, despite describing difficulties in the relationship and verbal abuse from Mr. Cooper, she said he had never physically assaulted her. There is one episode when she said she was ""dragged"" when he grabbed her by the arm and marched her down a set of stairs. Specifically however, there were no other incidents of physical aggression, according to Ms. Mulcahy's history at interview. There is also no history of sexual violence. When I persisted further along this line of enquiry she simply stated that she found it very difficult to talk about the situation and could not give me an answer. She referred me to her affidavit.""


269It seems that Dr Klug has proceeded on the basis that although he has read the affidavit he places no great reliance on it in contrast to what little he elicited in the interview. For example there is no reference in his report to the threats to shoot or maim. There could be several reasons for her attitude. She may have wished to be non-cooperative or she may have had a real difficulty in reliving the events again in the telling process. I think the latter is more likely.

270Having regard to these matters and the other matters appearing in the cross examination I prefer the evidence of Dr Fischer to that of Dr Klug on this aspect. There is an unresolved question as to when the disability commenced to have an effect upon her. Dr Fischer suggests that she experienced an insidious deterioration in her capacity to assert herself in the relationship and that the disability occurred ""from the earliest time in the relationship"". Dr Kraushaar expresses some views on its commencement date but I will not have regard to them for the reasons already expressed. 

271In my view the disability would have commenced after the events in 1993 and continued until a time shortly after the commencement of the proceedings in the Statement of Claim, August 2008, when she started to respond to the claim. The limitation period is therefore suspended, by reason of her disability, until this time. Applying the three-year limitation period, she brought the proceedings within time.

273So far as the future is concerned Dr Fischer has opined that her present incapacity will not continue in the future if she has appropriate treatment. Dr Kraushaar who will no doubt be treating her puts the time for recovery at 12 to 24 months to recover from the trauma. I accept that it reasonable to expect her inability to work to cease within 2 years from judgement.

274As to past economic loss Dr Fischer gives evidence, which I accept, that she was incapacitated from working as a shop assistant from the time of separation.

Damages

275The defendant has satisfied me that five incidents of assault and/or battery occurred and that she has brought her action in relation to these within time. I am also satisfied that by reason of the assaults and batteries the defendant has suffered anxiety and depression.

276Any award of damages in this matter is not subject to a statutory cap pursuant to the Civil Liability Act 2002 because it relates to an intentional tort (see s 3B of the Civil Liability and, for example, Zorom Enterprises v Zabow [2007] NSWCA 106).

Assessment of damages

277The difficulty in assessing damages in a case involving numerous incidents resulting in psychiatric injury was described by Walmsley SC DCJ in Varmedja v Varmedja [2007] NSWDC 385 at [111]:

""A particular difficulty is the fact that there is a large number of separate torts alleged which collectively, on the psychiatric evidence, have cause the psychiatric injury. It may be wrong to attribute a part of the psychological injury to one or two of the earliest assault, although each of them may have made a contribution to the ultimate condition.""

278I note that in Varmedja v Varmedja the court was concerned with a far larger number of separate torts than have been proved in this case.

279The defendant urged me to adopt a global approach to damages but I do not think this is appropriate.

Compensatory damages

280The defendant submitted that the appropriate range for compensatory general damages is $175,000 to $225,000.

281She also claims:


Past out of pocket expenses of $19218.35 
Past economic loss of $112,011.03 
Future economic loss of $85,000, and 
Future out of pocket expenses of $83,125.

282In support of this range, the defendant referred me to the case of Bova v Locke [2005] NSWCA 226 where there was an award of $225000 for general damages. The case is far removed from the present one and I do not find it helpful. It is trite to say that it all depends on the circumstances of the individual case. One can look at another case; say for example Jackson v Jackson (NSWSC, 26 March 1999, unreported) where I gave an award of $10,000 for a",2012-04-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708323,Iqbal v R [2012] NSWCCA 72,"Judgment

1The applicant sought leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a ruling in respect of his prospective trial made by a judge of the District Court on 4 October 2011.

2The applicant has been charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was initially charged with the offence by way of a CAN requiring him to appear before the Local Court on 22 February 2011. On 11 January 2011 an order was made in the Local Court for service of the brief of evidence and the time for an election as to whether the offence will be dealt with on indictment was fixed for 22 February 2011.

3On 22 February 2011 the police informant was represented by a police prosecutor. The prosecutor told the Court and it was indicated that ""no election"" to have the matter heard in the District Court would be made. Subsequently, the matter was listed for summary hearing in the Local Court on 17 June 2011.

4That hearing date was later vacated at the request of the applicant and on 13 May 2011 a new hearing date of 24 to 26 October 2011 was fixed. On 2 June 2011 the Director of Public Prosecutions (""DPP"") determined to take over the matter. He elected to have the prosecution proceed by way of indictment.

5On 7 July 2011 the matter was relisted for 28 July 2011 to allow the DPP to make an application to vacate the hearing date. On 28 July 2011 the hearing of that application was stood over to 4 August 2011.

6On 4 August 2011 the Director made an application pursuant to s 263(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for leave to have the matter proceed by way of indictment and to vacate the hearing date in the Local Court. The Local Court magistrate refused leave and the hearing date was maintained. No appeal was lodged in respect of that decision.

7On 23 September 2011 an ex officio indictment was filed in the District Court. Before that court the applicant applied for a stay of the prosecution, contending that it was an abuse of process. The application was refused resulting in the application for leave to appeal to this Court.

8The applicant's argument was helpfully confined. It was submitted that by filing an ex officio indictment the Director of Public Prosecutions had elected to avoid the decision properly made in the Local Court to refuse leave to elect pursuant to s 263(2) of the Act resulting in an abuse of process. It was submitted that the abuse arises from the impact of the Director's decision upon public confidence in the proper administration of justice. 

9Before the District Court reliance was placed on the High Court's decision in Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; (1992) 174 CLR 509 where Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ identified (at 520) two fundamental policy considerations which must be taken into account when dealing with an alleged abuse of process in the context of criminal proceedings. Their Honours said:

""The first is that the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. The second is that, unless the court protects its ability so to function in that way, its failure can lead to an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice.""

10Before this Court the applicant accepted that the filing of ex officio indictment by the DPP is not reviewable by the courts. It was also accepted that the filing of the ex officio indictment has the effect of removing the jurisdiction of the Local Court to determine the matter. The applicant emphasised that rather than seeking to vacate the hearing date in the Local court on the basis that an ex officio indictment would be filed (no decision being made to file an indictment until after the refusal of leave in the Local Court) the DPP applied pursuant to s 263(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act for leave to elect to have the matter proceed by way of indictment. When leave was refused, instead of seeking a review of that order in the Supreme Court, the DPP proceeded by way of ex officio indictment. It was submitted that by now allowing the proceedings to continue in the District Court the DPP would be permitted to evade or ignore the decision by the Local Court refusing the application for leave to elect, thereby leading to an erosion of public confidence in the processes of both the Local and District Courts.

11Chapter 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides for the summary disposal of indictable offences by Local Courts. Section 258 sets out the objects of Chapter 5 which are to require the indictable offences (listed in the relevant table) to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor, or in some cases the person charged with the offence concerned, elects to have the offence dealt with on indictment. In the present case the offence with which the applicant has been charged is found in Table 1. 

12Section 260 of the Act provides that an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor or person charged with the offence elects to have it dealt with in accordance with Chapter 5 on indictment. An indictable offence listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 is required by s 260(2) to be dealt with summarily by the Local Court unless the prosecutor elects to have it dealt with on indictment.

13Section 263(1) provides that an election to have an offence dealt with on indictment ""must be made within the time fixed by the Local Court."" Subsection 2 provides that ""an election may, with the leave of the Local Court, be made after the time so fixed if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist."" Subsection 3 provides that an election may not be made after evidence has commenced to be taken in a trial, or facts presented in respect of a sentence hearing for a person who pleads guilty.

14The applicant disavowed any submission that the legislative scheme inhibited the director's capacity to file an ex officio indictment. The submission was confined to the argument that having made an application to the Local Court seeking leave to make an election out of time, which failed, it was an abuse of process to seek to prosecute on indictment in the District Court.

15Chapter 5 was previously found in Part 9A of the Act. In R v Bartalesi; R v Fragassi (1997) 93 A Crim R 274 this Court considered whether the provisions of Part 9A inhibited the Director from filing an ex officio indictment. Section 4 of the Act was then in similar terms to s 8 of the present Act. Section 8 provides for prosecution on indictment for all offences other than an offence that is required to be dealt with summarily: s 8(3).

16In Bartalesi Handley JA concluded that Part 9A (as it then was) and s 4 (as it then was) must be reconciled to make them consistent. His Honour said:

""This is not difficult because in my view Part 9A (except s 33H(2)) [which deals with the service of the brief of evidence and a person's criminal record] should be construed as directions to the Local Court to govern it in the exercise of its jurisdiction, which have no direct application to the Supreme and District Courts in the exercise of theirs. Section 4(2) can thus continue to authorise the prosecuting authority to commence proceedings by indictment in those courts as it did prior to commencement of Part 9A.""

17Bartalesi was concerned with the situation where an ex officio indictment was filed following the refusal of a magistrate to commit the accused for trial in respect of offences arising out of the same facts. The accused persons sought to have the prosecution stayed on the ground that Part 9A of the Act had overridden s 4.

18Although rejecting the accused's argument Handley JA acknowledged that there may be circumstances in which an ex officio indictment may be stayed for abuse of process ""where the absence of prior committal proceedings will occasion unfair prejudice to the accused"": see Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; (1980) 147 CLR 75 and Barron v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 10 NSWLR 215; 29 A Crim R 230. However, his Honour indicated that the argument in Bartalesi was not framed upon a claim of unfair prejudice.

19In Kolalich v DPP (NSW) [1991] HCA 47; (1991) 173 CLR 222 the High Court accepted that ""it is well established that the DPP clearly has power to present an ex officio indictment charging a person with an offence notwithstanding that the committing magistrate has declined to make an order committing him for trial on a charge of that offence"" (p 227). However, the Court also acknowledged that circumstances could arise in which an exercise by the DPP of that power would constitute an abuse of process. 

20There is little to distinguish the present circumstances from the situation where a magistrate has declined to commit an accused person. In each case the DPP has chosen to file an indictment in circumstances where a decision in the Local Court would not provide the foundation for the prosecution of the alleged offence on indictment.

21In Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27; (2006) 226 CLR 256 the High Court was careful to identify that what amounts to abuse of process has not been definitively identified and is ""insusceptible of a formulation comprising closed categories"" [9]. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ instance the situation where proceedings have been commenced in a second forum where there are pending proceedings in another forum. In that circumstance there will be an unfairness to the accused person which may be an abuse of process requiring the remedy of a stay. The applicant submitted that the present circumstance is similar in that proceedings have been instituted in the District Court where there are proceedings in another forum. That may be an argument for the Local Court proceedings to be stayed if it was suggested that they should proceed to a hearing but does not otherwise support the applicant's argument.

22Senior Counsel for the applicant in the present case disavowed any argument that by reason of the Director filing an ex officio indictment the applicant would suffer unfair prejudice. To my mind that concession is rightly made. Although, as was submitted on his behalf, the applicant has been required to defend the Director's application for leave in the Local Court his ultimate trial in the District Court will not be prejudiced in any manner because of the procedure which has been followed. If there is any issue that requires exploration before trial this may be dealt with in the now conventional manner of a Basher inquiry.

23The prosecutor's discretion to proceed by ex officio indictment was confirmed in PM v The Queen [2007] HCA 49; (2007) 232 CLR 370. In that case the High Court determined that although the offence could have been prosecuted in the Children's Court, this did not preclude the Director from filing an ex officio indictment. However, that decision was determined by the relevant provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) and did not give rise to a principle of general application.

24Although I can appreciate that in the present case the applicant may be disappointed because his expectation that he would be dealt with in the Local Court has been denied I am not persuaded that the procedure which has been adopted would lead to an erosion of public confidence in the processes of either or both the Local and District Courts. Indeed, my present understanding of the facts to be alleged against the applicant are such that public confidence in the criminal justice system may be adversely impacted if the matter is not prosecuted on indictment.

25Although I would grant leave to appeal that appeal should be dismissed.

2708328,Kho v R [2012] NSWCCA 71,"Judgment
1The appellant, Chuan Tat Kho was convicted following a trial by jury of an offence which was pleaded in the following terms that:
""He on 16 January 2009 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin in an amount of 13.999 kilograms which was not less than a large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.""
2The offence which is contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
3The appellant was sentenced to a period of 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years. The case against the appellant was one of deemed supply: s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.
Evidence at the trial
4The appellant stood trial jointly with a co-offender Tan, who was alleged to have supplied the heroin to the appellant and another co-offender Loh. Loh pleaded guilty. The appellant and Loh were staying at the Mantra hotel at Chatswood. On the day of the offence they were observed by the police from when they left the Hotel and travelled by train to the city where they met another offender Tan. The heroin was transported by Tan in a trolley-case and was delivered to the appellant and Loh at a Starbucks Cafe near Chinatown, at Haymarket. There were images from CCTV cameras in the area of the cafe, and still photos were tendered of the three sitting in the cafe. 
5The police gave evidence of their observations of the offenders but did not give any evidence of overhearing their conversation. The closed circuit camera images of the scene did not record the appellant being in conversation with the others at the table. However, a police officer did say that he saw the appellant engaged in conversation with them, although that officer accepted that the majority of the conversation was between the co-accused Loh and Tan. The appellant was observed to enter the cafe twice and return with two drinks and later a third. When they left the cafe the appellant was seen to wheel the trolley-case that had been brought to the cafe by Tan, for a short distance to the street. He then hailed a taxi, whilst the other two were walking together and a little distance from him. He put the case into the boot of the taxi before he and the co-offender Loh got into the taxi. The police followed the taxi and the appellant and Loh were arrested a short time later. The police discovered heroin in the trolley case.
6The appellant took part in an ERISP in which he denied knowledge of the heroin. He said that he had never seen or met the co-offender Tan before. He said he was visiting Australia and stayed at the invitation of his friend, Loh, in his hotel room. He said he just went with Loh to the cafe as Loh told him they were meeting someone. He said that Loh told him nothing more about what was to happen. He said he did not talk to Tan, but he just sat there and listened to them talking. He thought they were talking Mandarin and ""I think also Hokkein also have."" He said he could not really hear what the co-offenders were talking about due to the noisy street. He said he was asked to wheel the case to the street and he had no idea where they were going, other than that he thought they were going back to their hotel. All he knew was that Loh was awaiting a further phone call.
7The appellant did not know how to open the case containing the heroin when asked to do so by the police. When Loh was questioned by the police he said that he had been told the combination to unlock the case and he provided it to the police.
8There was also evidence at the trial of telephone records that proved a series of calls between telephones linked to the co-offenders Tan and Loh, but there was no telephone evidence in respect of the appellant. When he was arrested the appellant had three mobile telephones in his possession. Loh was in possession of the sum of $7,000 at the time of the arrest, together with 4 mobile phones and 4 separate sim cards.
9Following the arrest the police searched the hotel room in Chatswood. In one of two suitcases they found a large quantity of plastic re-sealable bags and an unopened box of disposable latex gloves under some large size men's clothing. There was also a Coles receipt dated 30.12.08 (a day after the appellant's arrival in Sydney) for 4 packs containing a total of 50 Coles brand storage bags. It was not in dispute that the suitcase belonged to the appellant. The appellant was not asked about this in the ERISP interview and he did not give evidence at his trial. Detective Van Eyk gave evidence that the re-sealable bags found in the suitcase were not the type that would be found in street level drug supplies. However, he did say that larger bags may be used for ""bulking up"" before an onward supply.
10The Crown case was that the appellant was part of a joint criminal enterprise with the co-offender Loh. It was suggested that their role in the enterprise was to take delivery of the heroin and then move it on to the next level, after getting further instructions. The Crown argued that the plastic re-sealable bags and the latex gloves were for the purpose of repackaging the heroin, or bulking it up. It was the prosecution case that the fact that the police found no other indicia of supply in the hotel room was not significant, as it was submitted that they would not have undertaken that task in an hotel room that is serviced daily. The Crown also argued in relation to the appellant that it was consistent with a major drug operation that the delivery persons or middlemen would not be told too much in advance, but would be given their instructions progressively.
11The appellant's case was related in his ERISP interview. At his trial it was not in dispute that he was captured in the CCTV images, that he wheeled the trolley bag for a short distance, and that he was staying with the co-offender Loh in the hotel room at Chatswood. Nor was it in dispute that the plastic re-sealable bags and the rubber gloves were found in his suitcase. He said that he was just visiting Sydney as a tourist and accepted his friend's invitation to stay in the hotel room with him. He said that he went with him to the cafe and knew nothing about the purpose of the journey, and did not know that the bag contained heroin, or any prohibited drug.
12There are four grounds of appeal which were pleaded as follows:
Ground 1: His Honour erred in admitting irrelevant evidence relating to surveillance of the appellant and the co-offender Loh from their hotel at Chatswood to Starbucks in the city at Haymarket. Leave is required pursuant to Rule 4.
Ground 2: His Honour erred when he left the question of an asserted lie being evidence of consciousness of guilt to the jury.
Ground 3: Leave is sought to adduce fresh evidence from the co-offender Loh.
Ground 4: The trial judge entered the arena and unnecessarily interrupted the flow of cross-examination by trial Counsel for the appellant.
13During the course of the hearing of the appeal it became apparent that there was a significant issue in relation to the competency of the appellant's defence at trial. Leave was sought, which was not opposed by the respondent, to amend the Notice of Appeal to add an additional ground in the following terms:
Ground 5
The incompetence of counsel in preparation and running of [the appellant's] trial, in particular by failing to ascertain whether or not the witness, Loh, was able and willing to give evidence consistent with the sentencing proceeding evidence of Loh and the [appellant] and to neutralise the evidence of association between the [appellant] and Loh in the trial of the applicant thus occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
14This further ground of appeal was prompted by evidence which was given by Loh at his sentence hearing and at the sentence hearing for the appellant.
15In short Loh gave evidence that he was related to the appellant; that he had a conversation with the co-offender Tan which did not include the appellant; that he (Loh) was told the combination of the lock on the case; that he bought the plastic bags; that he had received the sum of $40,000 for his part in the enterprise and that the appellant was not present when he received that money and nor did he tell the appellant about it; that he did not tell the appellant any details about why they were going to meet Tan in Chinatown, that they had known each other for a long time and would often do things together and the appellant just followed him on that day; he repeated what he had said in earlier evidence that he had offered the appellant accommodation for his stay in Sydney; that he recalled that the appellant grabbed the bag but he did not ask him to; the appellant just did it automatically and he (Loh) did not realise the seriousness of the appellant taking the bags as he was just to await instructions and then hand the bag to another person. He said he did not tell the appellant what to do and he did not know himself what he was to do next, until he received instructions on the telephone. He said that he did not tell the appellant that he was to get further instructions on the telephone.
16The appellant's defence at his trial was consistent with the account of the relevant events which Loh gave at the sentencing hearing. Loh was arraigned together with the appellant and pleaded guilty. Having admitted his guilt the obvious question, given the appellant's version of the events, was whether Loh was able to give evidence to support the appellant's account of the events. That issue was not raised by defence counsel.
17The appellant and Loh were arraigned together. Counsel for the appellant must have had instructions by that time that his client said that he had innocently become caught up in Loh's illegal activities. Given that Loh admitted his involvement in the enterprise it should have been obvious to defence counsel that his best course in defending his client would be if Loh was prepared to give evidence in which he confirmed that the appellant had no knowledge of the enterprise. The appropriate course to take was to seek to interview Loh to determine the evidence which he might be able to give in the appellant's trial.
18The evidence which Loh ultimately gave both at his own sentence hearing and at the appellant's sentencing hearing, if accepted by a jury, would have led to the appellant's acquittal. Loh gave evidence in similar terms to this Court. Although some aspects of Loh's evidence would need careful consideration, if it was accepted, it confirmed that the appellant had no knowledge of and was not a participant in the enterprise in which Loh was a participant.
19The competence of counsel and its relevance to the trial of an accused person has been the subject of consideration on many occasions. As Gleeson CJ emphasised in Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 162 A Crim R 301, a criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation. The Chief Justice said at [9]:
""A cardinal principle of such litigation is that, subject to carefully controlled qualifications, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel, who exercise a wide discretion in deciding what issues to contest, what witnesses to call, what evidence to lead or to seek to have excluded, and what lines of argument to pursue. The law does not pursue that principle at all costs. It recognises the possibility that justice may demand exceptions. Nevertheless, the nature of adversarial litigation, with its principles concerning the role of counsel, sets the context in which these issues arise.""
20The Chief Justice emphasised that when the competence of counsel is raised as a ground of appeal the relevant inquiry will be as to whether the trial and its process was fair. Because the trial is adversarial litigation considerations of fairness often turn upon the choices made by counsel at a trial. As happened in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR124, a failure by trial counsel to call evidence, which it was later submitted would have been of assistance to the appellant, may not occasion a miscarriage of justice because, when viewed objectively, counsel's decision was rational. As Gleeson CJ said:
""It is the fairness of the process that is in question; not the wisdom of counsel. ... The nature of the adversarial system, and the assumptions on which it operates, will lead to the conclusion, in most cases, that a complaint that counsel's conduct has resulted in an unfair trial will be considered by reference to an objective standard, and without an investigation of the subjective reasons for that conduct.""
21Gleeson CJ emphasised that it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered or appropriate before a trial is fair. Furthermore, in Nudd Gummow and Hayne JJ emphasised that although the conduct of trial counsel may be described as incompetent that will not of itself be sufficient to ground a successful appeal. Their Honours said at [24]:
""Alleging that trial counsel was incompetent does not reveal what is said to be the miscarriage of justice. That requires consideration of what did or did not occur at the trial, of whether there was a material irregularity in the trial, and whether there was a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial.""
22In the present case defence counsel gave evidence before this Court. It is apparent that, most likely through inexperience, he did not identify the fact that once Loh had pleaded guilty he may be able to give evidence in the appellant's trial which, if accepted, would have led to his acquittal. There was no tactical or forensic reason why the appellant's counsel did not seek to have Loh give evidence. It is plain that he should have taken this course.
23I am of the opinion that, for this reason, the appellant was incompetently represented at his trial. Counsel should have questioned whether Loh could give evidence to support the appellant's account. It may be assumed from the fact that he gave that evidence at the sentencing hearing that he would have done so. If Loh's account was to be accepted by a jury the appellant's acquittal would be inevitable. There was no direct evidence of the appellant's involvement in the criminal enterprise. No telephone message was intercepted which could have related to the offence and there was no suggestion that he received any money or other reward for his involvement. Although he admitted purchasing the plastic bags he provided an apparently innocent explanation which the jury could accept. When Loh met with Tan the CCTV footage disclosed that the appellant did not join them in any conversation and for a significant period was absent purchasing refreshments.
24I would uphold this ground of appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.
Ground 1
25The submission in relation to this ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the surveillance of the appellant and Loh from the time they left their hotel at Chatswood. It was submitted that the evidence had no relevance and that its prejudicial effect was significant. The prejudice was said to arise from the fact that by instituting surveillance it was apparent, and the jury would have understood, that the police held suspicions about both the appellant and Loh. Although it was accepted that Loh was the cause of the surveillance it was alleged that the police had no information about any involvement of the appellant in illegal drug dealing.
26The submission is without substance. The case against the appellant was that he was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with the co-offender Loh. The surveillance evidence was relevant and admissible to prove that the two men were staying together at the same hotel and that they travelled from there to the Starbucks cafe for a meeting with Tan where heroin was delivered. It was the Crown case that the purpose of the appellant and Loh travelling together for a significant distance after which they would have a short meeting with Tan was clearly for ""business"" rather than social purposes.
27The appellant emphasised that in the course of its deliberations the jury asked a question of the trial judge in the following terms:
""How much weight does circumstantial evidence have? Are we able to know why Koh and Loh were under surveillance?""
28In response to this question the trial judge told the jury:
""The simple answer to that is no, it's not part of the evidence and you must not speculate on what might have attracted the AFP and the New South Wales police force to do. What you need to look at is what happened from that point when they started the surveillance and what the evidence there describes. That is what is important in this case. Why the police happened to be there is irrelevant to your considerations. You should not embark upon any speculation on those matters.""
29It may be that the police originally had suspicions in relation to Loh, but not the appellant. However, when, as it happened, the appellant accompanied Loh to meet Tan the fact that they travelled together was relevant. The direction by the trial judge was adequate to dispel any suggestion of unfair prejudice arising from a suggestion of unfounded suspicions with respect to the appellant.
30No objection was taken, at the trial either to the admission of the evidence nor the direction given by the trial judge. The probative value of the evidence was significant. Any potential for unfair prejudice was adequately addressed by the trial judge's direction.
31I would refuse leave to raise ground 1 of the appeal.
Ground 2
32In the course of his ERISP the appellant was asked to give an estimate of the age of the man Tan. There was no evidence that the appellant had previously met Tan and accordingly the impression he may have formed of his age was confined to their brief meeting at Starbucks.
33The ERISP comprises 457 questions. Although the appellant understands and is reasonably fluent in English it is plain that English is not his first language.
34Question 138 in the ERISP reads as follows:
""Q: OK. With the bag this morning, did you know that you were going to meet with somebody?
A: No.""
35He then explained to the police that he went with Loh whom he thought was going to meet a friend but he had never seen the ""other person"" (Tan) before and he did not know his name or anything about him.
36He was asked about the age of the ""other person"" (Tan) and gave the answer:
""Q375 Well do you remember anything about him, was he young, old, was he about your age?A I think should be around middle age.""
37The trial judge permitted the prosecution to submit to the jury that out of a consciousness of guilt the appellant had lied about the age of Tan to avoid Tan being identified and possibly providing the police with information that would implicate the appellant. The particular answer that was emphasised by the prosecution was the appellant's description of Tan as ""around middle age.""
38No complaint is made about the direction given by his Honour which was in conventional terms when the prosecution submits that an accused person has lied from a consciousness of guilt. However, the appellant's submission was that the matter should not have been left with the jury at all. It was submitted that both the suggestion that the appellant lied and, if he did so, it was from a consciousness of guilt were not open.
39To my mind the appellant's submission should be accepted. Identification of a person's age is always difficult, particularly if the meeting with them is brief. Furthermore, the description ""around middle age"" is vague and carries with it the necessity to identify what the speaker considers to be middle aged. It will vary from person to person. To conclude (as the prosecution invited the jury to do) that in these circumstances the appellant had lied and furthermore lied out of a consciousness of guilt was, to my mind, not open.
40It is of course not possible to discern whether the jury concluded that the appellant lied. Accordingly, whether the issue played any part in the jury's decision is unknown. For my part, although I am satisfied the issue should not have been left with the jury, I do not believe that it occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The jury could be expected to understand that estimates of age are always liable to be erroneous, often to a significant degree.
41Although I would uphold this ground of appeal I would not for that reason have quashed the conviction.
Ground 3
42The co offender Loh gave evidence at his own sentencing proceedings. On that occasion he told the court that he knew he was collecting drugs and would be required to deliver them to another party. He also told the court that the appellant was not involved in the enterprise. I have previously referred to Loh's account.
43As a result of Loh giving this evidence the trial judge (the same judge presided at both hearings) and the Crown prosecutor took the view that the appellant should be alerted to the evidence which had emerged. As it happened and, no doubt because of knowledge of the evidence which Loh could give, Loh was called to give evidence on behalf of the appellant during his sentence proceedings. Although the evidence was received, the trial judge correctly ruled that it traversed the plea and was not admissible in relation to the appellant's sentence.
44An application was made that Loh's evidence should be received as fresh evidence in this Court. However, as was recognised in the course of submissions, because the evidence was available to the appellant at the time of his trial and reasonable diligence could have brought it forward that submission must be rejected: see Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516; R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at [2]; R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35, at 38 and MRW v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 260 at [45]-[54]. The consequence must be that this ground of appeal is rejected, although for the reasons I have indicated ground 5 should succeed.
Ground 4
45The trial judge is a very experienced criminal lawyer. As the transcript of this trial makes plain his Honour accepts the burden of ensuring that a trial before him is fair to an accused person but also efficiently conducted.
46In recent years there has been a growing concern amongst judges and, others, including advocates involved in the criminal trial process, about the length of time that criminal trials have been taking. The availability of intercept material and surveillance evidence has significantly increased the length of many trials. This is especially true of trials involving the illegal importation or supply of prohibited drugs where sophisticated investigative procedures are often utilised. On occasion when these trials have been conducted without a focus on the efficient management of evidence following an analysis of the issues in dispute, jurors have become distracted and the trial has miscarried. Inefficiency in the trial process can cause serious injustice to an accused and significantly increase the costs of the trial, including the costs of providing the court, the prosecutor and in many cases legally aided defence counsel.
47In a response to these problems in 2008 the Attorney-General established a working group to review efficiencies in criminal trials. In 2009 the working group released a report publishing its findings. The recommendations of the report resulted in the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Case Management) Act 2009, designed to provide judges with the power to ensure the efficient management of trials.
48At an early stage of the appellant's trial his Honour made plain to counsel that he intended to ensure that the trial proceeded efficiently. Amongst other matters he told counsel that he would not allow the proceedings to be stalled or delayed. He added, no doubt for emphasis, ""if necessary we'll sit through weekends."" The latter remark was not necessary but no doubt served to emphasise his Honour's determination that the trial should be efficiently conducted.
49Throughout the trial there were a number of occasions on which the trial judge intervened when prosecution witnesses were being cross-examined. It is not necessary to reproduce extracts from the transcript. However, it is apparent that his Honour formed the view that defence counsel lacked the experience to effectively represent the appellant.
50Consideration of a number of his Honour's interventions does leave the impression, which no doubt was held by the jury, that his Honour had little confidence in the ability of defence counsel. It was submitted by the appellant that his Honour's interjections were of such frequency that defence counsel was effectively bullied and for this reason was unable to effectively discharge his obligations to his client. It was submitted that some of his Honour's interventions were designed to humiliate defence counsel and control the manner in which his case was conducted although his Honour was not privy to the appellant's instructions. It was submitted that trial counsel was unable to develop effective lines of cross-examination due to continuous interruption.
51It is an inevitable consequence of the adversarial system that there may from time to time be an imbalance in the competence of the prosecutor and defence counsel. There will always be difficulties when the trial judge comes to the view that, through lack of experience or incompetence, an accused person is not being effectively represented. The trial judge has an obligation to ensure that an accused person receives a fair trial and on occasion this may require the trial judge to enquire of counsel as to the relevance of a particular question or the appropriateness of a particular submission. However, if interventions are made in the presence of a jury there is always a risk that the jury will interpret the apparent inadequacies of trial counsel in a manner which reflects adversely upon the accused. If a trial judge believes such interventions to be necessary it is better that the issue is pursued in the absence of the jury.
52It is undoubted that a trial judge has power to intervene in the questioning of a witness to assist in an understanding of the evidence which the witness can give. However, the power should be exercised with care to ensure that the intervention by the judge does not impede the development by trial counsel of the case he or she has been instructed to develop. 
53A perusal of the transcript in the present case confirms, as was admitted by counsel who appeared for the appellant in this Court, that defence counsel at trial lacked the experience necessary to effectively represent his client.  The concern which the trial judge obviously held that the appellant was not being competently represented was plainly justified. As the trial progressed his concerns increased and his intervention became more pointed.
54Although the jury would no doubt have formed the view that the trial judge lacked confidence in defence counsel's capacity, I am not persuaded that the nature or extent of the interventions by the trial judge caused the trial to miscarry. Because of the surveillance material the prosecution case was not, in reality, open to challenge. The jury's decision did not depend upon the effective cross-examination of any witness but on the inference to be drawn from the uncontested facts. 
55Although his Honour's interventions were significant and at times occurred when it would have been better if the jury were not present, I am not persuaded that for that reason the trial miscarried. I would reject this ground of appeal.
Other matters
56The appellant sought to agitate grounds of appeal in relation to his sentence. In the circumstances it is not necessary to consider these matters. I would make the following orders:
1. Appeal upheld.2. The conviction in the District Court is quashed.3. Order that there be a new trial.
57JOHNSON J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
58GROVE AJ:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		24 April 2013",2012-04-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708334,R v FH [2012] NSWDC 283,"Judgment
1This is an application under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for trial by judge alone.
2An election under s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was filed in Court this morning.  No objection has been taken by the Crown that there has been no compliance with s 132A(1) of the same Act.
3It is important to bear in mind some historical matters.  On Monday 17 October 2011 the Crown called the accused for trial and presented an indictment containing nine counts.
4The first count was that between 14 October 2005 and 31 December 2005 the accused assaulted CC [""the complainant""] and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency upon her in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the assault she was under the age of sixteen years, namely eleven years.  The allegation by the Crown was of a touching by the accused of the complainant's breasts.
5Count 2 was an allegation of sexual intercourse with the complainant, a child then above the age of ten years and under the age of fourteen years, namely eleven years, during the period from 24 October 2005 until 3 June 2006.  The allegation was of digital penetration per vaginam.
6Count 3 was again alleged to have occurred between 24 October 2005 and 6 June 2006 and was an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the complainant was under the authority of the accused.  The allegation by the Crown is that the accused caused the complainant to masturbate his penis until ejaculation.
7Counts 4 and 5 were alleged to have occurred on the same occasion.  The range of dates given was between 7 June 2007 and 6 June 2008.  The first allegation is an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the complainant was under the authority of the accused.  The particulars supplied by the Crown were that the accused caused the complainant to masturbate his penis.  The fifth count was of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and fourteen years, namely thirteen years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the complainant was under the authority of the accused.  The particulars provided by the Crown were of digital penetration per vaginam.
8Count 6 is alleged to have occurred between 1 September 2007 and 31 October 2007.  It as a count of sexual intercourse with a child between the age of ten years and fourteen years under the authority of the accused.  This is a further allegation of digital penetration per vaginam.
9Counts 7 and 8 were alleged to have been committed in the same circumstances.  Count 7 is an act of indecency where the complainant was under the authority of the accused.  Again, the particulars given were that the accused caused the complainant to masturbate his penis until ejaculation.  Count 8 was a further allegation of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and fourteen years, namely thirteen years, who was under the authority of the accused.  Again, the particulars were of digital penetration per vaginam.
10The final count in the indictment presented on 17 October 2011 was that on 30 July 2010 the accused possessed child pornography.  The pornography relied upon by the Crown was a cropped photograph of the complainant's vagina, found on the computer used by the accused.
11The trial proceeded from Monday 17 October until Thursday 20 October 2011 when it was stood over part heard to Monday 24 October 2011.  The reason why no time was spent on the trial on Friday 25 October was because I was the list judge here at Campbelltown and was required to call the normal list and deal with the ""short matters"".
12The trial resumed on Monday 24 October when there were closing submissions by the Crown and the defence.  It was then adjourned until Tuesday 25 October 2011 when I summed up the case to the jury and invited them to retire to consider their verdicts.
13At the close of the day on 25 October 2011 I made an order pursuant to s 54(1)(b) of the Jury Act 1977, permitting the jury to separate, after having retired to consider their verdicts, to re-assemble on the following morning and to continue their deliberations.  The jury returned on Wednesday 26 October 2011 and continued their deliberations.
14Eventually the jury advised me that they had reached a unanimous verdict on count 9 but were unable to reach either a unanimous verdict on counts 1 to 8 or, indeed, a majority verdict on counts 1 to 8.  I took the jury's verdict in respect of count 9 and then discharged the jury and set the matter down for trial on counts 1 to 8 to commence this day at 10am when, instead of the trial commencing, the application under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was made.
15The jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of count 9 of the original indictment.  I was surprised by that verdict at the time because it appeared to me, on the way the case had been presented and argued, that it would have been harder for the jury to reach a unanimous verdict on that count than it would have been to reach unanimous verdicts on the other counts in the indictment.  I shall have more to say about that presently.
16Mr Steirn SC, who appears for the accused, supports the application for trial by judge alone on three grounds.  The first is that there is expert evidence to be relied upon and that that is better dealt with by a judge alone rather than a jury.  The expert evidence relates to how photographic images are downloaded and stored in a computer.  Expert evidence was given at the original trial by Senior Constable Luke Shannon Bradley, and his evidence is recorded in the transcript of the earlier trial between pages 284 and 324.
17The Crown served, at 10.49am on 2 April 2012, a report from another expert, Phillip Moore, a ""departmental professional officer"" employed by the State Electronic Evidence Branch of the New South Wales Police Force.  It is clear from his qualifications that Mr Moore is not a sworn police officer.  He completed the Higher School Certificate in 2004 at Moriah College.  Between 2005 and 2009 he was on a business information technology cooperative scholarship at the University of New South Wales.  At the time he made his report for the current matter, he was working towards a graduate certificate in computer forensics at Macquarie University, which had commenced in 2011.  Having worked for two private companies between January 2008 and July 2008, he worked for what was then called the RTA as a project management and business analyst and he has, since January 2011, worked for the New South Wales Police.  In his report, Mr Moore refers to the earlier report prepared by Senior Constable Bradley, who he refers to as ""DPO (formerly Senior Constable) Luke Bradley"".  It would appear that the position of departmental professional officer is now preferred to ordinary police rank.  The inference to be drawn is that Mr Moore and Senior Constable Bradley work together in the same department of the Police Force, and the Force may well take the view that the evidence of one is as good as the evidence of the other.  Suffice it to say that the evidence of Mr Moore merely supplements the evidence of Senior Constable Bradley and answers questions arising at the first trial, which had been left ""hanging"".
18There is no competing expert evidence.  The expert evidence is really quite straightforward.  It merely explains the process by which a photograph taken on a camera can be downloaded into a computer; how that downloaded photograph might be stored in the computer and as to whether viewing a photograph on the computer would create a file or not, and what must be done to create a modified image, and whether that creates a further file for that photograph.  The evidence also discusses whether the timing shown in analysis of the computer is local time, whether daylight saving time or standard time, or whether it is Greenwich Mean Time.  The evidence also discusses whether the images can be modified by being screened by a computer virus checker or the like.  It is, as I said, fairly straightforward evidence and any member of the jury who has any ability with computers will be easily well across it.
19The defence, in discussing the expert evidence, pointed out that the expert evidence had not been served at least twenty-one days prior to the trial and, its having been served on Monday 2 April 2012, the defence had no time to meet it because, in the interim, there had been only eight working days because of the Easter holiday, which commenced on Good Friday, 6 April 2012.  However, that itself cannot be grounds for a trial by judge alone.
20If the defence wishes to obtain expert evidence to rebut that recently served by the Crown, the appropriate remedy is to seek an adjournment in order to assess that evidence.  Indeed, Mr Steirn was kind enough to put an appropriate moniker on his client's position.  It was ""having a bob each way"".  The defence could not meet the expert evidence if it was trial by jury, but could meet the expert evidence if it was trial by judge alone.  That is not a frank concession that Mr Steirn made, but rather an encapsulation of the problem I discussed with him, that if the defence is unable to meet the expert evidence, that is grounds for granting an adjournment, whether it be trial by judge or trial by jury.
21The second ground relied upon by the accused is that the accused would be prejudiced in front of a jury because of the sexually explicit material relied upon by the Crown.  Indeed, there is a full transcript of the earlier trial in which proceedings, even before the empanelment of the jury, are recorded.  When addressing the jury panels, the learned Crown Prosecutor said, inter alia, this:
""The Crown also alleges that the accused took sexually explicit photos of the complainant and that ten such images were found on his computer when it was seized by police in July 2010.
You should be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that if you are selected on this jury it will be necessary for you to view those ten images, which are explicit images of child pornography involving the complainant, when she was between 11 and 13 years old.""
22There was no objection to the admission of the photographs.  They are, clearly, highly relevant and their prejudicial effect is overborne by their probative value.  The photographs, essentially, are of the vagina of the complainant.  The complainant said the photographs were taken by the accused but the accused's daughter said that she herself, the accused's daughter, took them.  The images could be described as ""erotic posing"" and are not anything more sinister when one considers the variety of matters one needs to consider when, for example, sentencing for offences of child pornography.  The images are not such as would startle or overwhelm the minds of any juror.
23The third ground relied upon by the defence is that the Crown wishes to adduce fresh evidence from ""S"", who is now referred to as the former wife of the accused, but at the time of the first trial was his wife.  The Crown apparently wishes to adduce admissions alleged to have been made by the accused to his former wife whilst he was in custody.  However, Mr Steirn, very properly, did not push this with any great animation or verve because, in the normal course of events, the Crown and the defence are able to agree to omitting evidence, for example, that the admission was made at a gaol rather than at some place which is not necessary to nominate.  The admission is merely the conversation rather than the fact that the conversation happened whilst the accused was in custody.
24The first thing to consider is the effect of s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  Section 131 of the same Act should also be borne in mind.  It is in these terms:
""Criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court are to be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided by this Part.""
Section 131 could be described as the general rule for a trial of criminal matters in this Court.  There are provisions otherwise, the major provision being s 132.  Section 132 is well known but, unfortunately, there is as yet no binding authority for how s 132 must be interpreted.
25The parties have helpfully drawn my attention to the decision of my learned colleague, Judge G D Woods QC, in R v GSR (3) [2011] NSWDC 17.  After referring to certain authorities his Honour said, commencing at [14]:
""[14] As I analyse it, there are essentially three possible positions.  (In argument before me, the Crown contended for approach (1) and the accused for approach (2)).
(1) One approach might be to assume a ""default"" position of trial by jury; that is to say one starts with a presumption in favour of trial by jury rather than by judge alone.
(2) A second position may be the reverse of that - that presumptively there ought to be trial by judge alone if the accused asks for it.
(3) A third possible approach is that the court should make no presumption either way, but should engage in the exercise of judicially weighing factors relevant to the interests of justice overall.
[15] In my view the third approach is correct.  Plainly the law relating to s 132 has been altered by the legislature and deliberately so.  Now the court should not presume trial by jury as the default position, nor alternatively assume that the accused wishes a prima facie determinative.""
26I freely and candidly acknowledge that his Honour Judge Woods QC is much more learned in the criminal law than I.  Indeed, he lectured me in criminal law at Law School.  However, with unfeigned respect to his Honour, I cannot agree.  There is persuasive authority from superior courts in other States.  There are, in particular, the decisions of the Court of Appeal of Queensland in R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 and R v Kissier [2011] QCA 223.  In Kissier the primary judgment was given by Mullins J, with whom Fraser and White JJA concurred.  After referring to the decision of Fardon, her Honour said:
""[29] Chesterman JA referred to s 604 of the Code [the equivalent of s 131 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986] which confers the right to trial by jury, subject to chapter div 9A which inserted the provisions into the Code for ""trial by judge alone"".  Chesterman JA then stated at [81]:
'It follows that trial on indictment before a judge without a jury is exceptional.  An applicant for a no jury order must show why the case comes within the exception.  An applicant for such an order, prosecutor or accused, must satisfy the court that it is in the interests of justice that that be the mode of trial.  If the Code expressed neutrality and no preference for a trial by a jury the order could have be had for the asking.  As it is the sections make it clear that there must be an application for a trial without a jury and, in accordance with ordinary principles, demonstrate why such an order is in the interests of justice.'
[30] In light of the purpose for which provision for a judge alone trial was introduced into the Code and the discretion to make a no jury order may be exercised only if the court considers it is in the interest of justice to do so, I favour the view expressed by Chesterman JA at [81] of Fardon.  The process for the determination of the application that is reflected in the terms of s 615 [the equivalent of s 132 of the NSW Act] does not require expression of a starting point on the application for a no jury order that both methods of trial are equally valid.""
27There are decisions to the same effect from the Supreme Court of Western Australia, in particular TVM v State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 299 (per McKechnie J) and Arthurs v State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 (per Martin CJ).  In my view the correct position is that it is up to the applicant before me, the accused, to establish why is the interests of justice that there not be trial by jury but trial by judge alone.  
28The arguments adduced by the accused on this application I do not find in any way persuasive.  As I have earlier mentioned, the expert evidence is really straightforward.  It is merely to assist the jury to understand how things are received by and stored in a computer and anyone with any reasonable working knowledge of computers (which does not include me) would understand that.  The sexually explicit material is not anything that most adults would not have seen at some stage in their lives and is hardly inflammatory or likely to put a jury into a state adverse to the accused merely because such photographic evidence exists and especially when evidence will be given, I assume, again by the accused's daughter, the friend of the complainant, that she herself took the photographs of her friend, the complainant.  The third ground, as I said, is really an everyday bread and butter issue in a criminal trial and can be easily dealt with by counsel.
29Mr Steirn also relied upon what fell from my colleague, Judge Berman SC, in R v Markou [2011] NSWDC 25.  In that case his Honour appears to have been persuaded by utilitarian arguments as to why trial by judge alone is preferable, namely that it can be much shorter than trial by jury and that at the end of the trial there must be a fully reasoned judgment to be given by a judge who sits without a jury.  Again, I acknowledge his Honour's greater facility and ability with the criminal law than mine, but I am unpersuaded by such utilitarian arguments.  After all, sometimes a leisurely, slow analysis of evidence is preferable to a rapid and swift determination of issues where sometimes subtleties in the evidence can be overlooked.  A slow criminal trial, in my view, is preferable to a speedy one.
30As to the requirement to give reasons, although Berman J was not persuaded by what fell from McKechnie J in TVM, I certainly am of the view that what fell from McKechnie J is correct.  At [32] his Honour said this:
""There is a public interest in the administration of justice carried out in public and in serious cases by the representatives of the public sitting as jurors.  The fact that a judge must deliver written reasons, where a jury gives a general verdict, is of no consequence.  That is a difference between the two modes of trial provided for by law.  The inscrutability of a verdict of twelve is tempered by unanimity.  The verdict of one is tempered by the exposure of reasons.  The interests of justice cannot then be affected by the mode of trial, each being valid.""
31I hasten to add this that sometimes trials by judge alone (and very often does this happen in the civil jurisdiction of a court) miscarry because the reasons for judgment given by the trial judge are inadequate and that can often lead to a further trial.  It may be that publishing reasons does assist one party or the other but published reasons often lead to retrial after retrial because of the inability of some judges to adequately express their reasoning and sometimes, when the reasons are adequately expressed, they show an inconsistency or irregularity which requires a retrial.  
32In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate case for trial by judge alone.  
33There is one further consideration which has concerned me throughout.  I have heard all the evidence and, as one does, even when sitting with a jury, one forms a view of how the evidence is proceeding.  I was surprised by the verdict of the jury, because I thought it would be easier for the jury to reach unanimous verdicts on counts one to eight, rather than on count nine.  I thought count nine would cause them the gravest difficulty.  That appears not to have been the case.  The jury reached a unanimous verdict of guilty on count nine.  That creates an estoppel between the Crown and the accused and is an estoppel which I, sitting as a judge alone, would have to bear in mind.  That was not an estoppel caused by any reasoning process that I adopted or any view of the evidence that I had formed.  I would feel compromised sitting as a judge in a trial by a judge alone in the current matter, having presided at the earlier jury trial.  In that regard, I must refer to what fell from Judge Woods QC in R v GSR (1) [2011] NSWDC 14.  His Honour said this:
""[31] I have borne in mind the Crown's submission that I could not avoid having formed a view about the credibility of the accused in the course of the previous trial on another indictment which resulted in a hung jury.  That is a proper submission to make, but in that trial I was not a finder of fact as to credit either by the accused or anybody else, and I made no such findings.  The very process of allowing judge alone trial in major criminal trials in some cases necessarily envisages that the task of the judge be one which is divided, as when a magistrate deals with a matter, or when a judge of the Land and Environment Court determines a criminal matter.  In such trials there is a separation between the role of the judge in assessing whether or not evidence is admissible and making procedural rulings, on the one hand, and on the other (having identified the relevant evidence, the applicable law and procedures) drawing conclusions as to fact.
[32] Section 132 was introduced in circumstances where that division of functions was well known and it must have been within the contemplation of the legislature that trial by judge alone would inevitably involve assessment of matters in both of the two areas I have described.  It is a necessary and common part of the judicial discipline to sequester extraneous matters from fact finding.  If I felt compromised in any way, or if I thought the reasonable person aware of all the facts might regard me as compromised, I would recuse myself and cause the matter to be put before another judge.""
34In the current matter I would feel compromised being the tribunal of fact.  That is because the matter does not come before me as if I were tabula rasa.  I have received the jury's verdict on what was count nine in the indictment presented on 17 October 2011.  I must necessarily sentence the accused for that crime.  To bring an open and unbiased mind to all the evidence, to be the tribunal of fact in what essentially is a credit issue between the complainant and the accused, would put me in an invidious position.
35If the application for trial by a jury had been made weeks and weeks ago, it might have been possible to overcome that problem by listing the matter for hearing before another judge at another venue such as Parramatta or Sydney.  However, that has, unfortunately, not been done.  I must bear that in mind in reaching the decision to which I have come, to refuse this application for trial by judge alone.  However, even if that were not the position, on the merits of the case as argued I would still reach the same conclusion that this is not an appropriate case for trial by a judge alone.  The application is refused.

		17 April 2013",2012-04-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708335,Kuti v R [2012] NSWCCA 43,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ AT CL:I agree with Davies J. 

2DAVIES J: On 12 May 2010 the Applicant entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court to an offence against s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years.

3On 1 April 2011 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Zahra SC in the District Court of NSW to a period of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing 29 November 2009 and expiring 28 May 2014. The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against that sentence claiming that it was manifestly excessive. 


The facts

4The following facts are taken from those found by the Sentencing Judge. 

5At about 3.10pm on Sunday 29 November 2009 the Applicant, a Nigerian national, arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, aboard a flight originating from Nigeria. The Applicant was travelling alone on a Nigerian passport. The Applicant's Incoming Passenger card noted ""Garden Lodge Sydney"" as the Applicant's address in Australia and another address in Haberfield as the Applicant's contact details in Australia. The card noted the length of the Applicant's stay in Australia as two weeks.

6The Applicant was selected by Customs officers for a search of his carry-on luggage. The Applicant did not have any checked luggage.

7During the search, a Customs drug detector dog reacted positively to the presence of narcotics in the suitcase found in the possession of the Applicant. However no narcotics were located in that suitcase.

8The Applicant was spoken to by Customs officers. The Applicant said that he worked as a farmer and had a coca farm. He said he had never been to Australia and was in Australia for a holiday during which he intended to ""go to the zoo, museum and have a rest"".

9The Applicant told Custom's officers that he had a booking for three days at a hotel in Haberfield that was booked by his travel agent. He said he intended to look for somewhere else to stay after the period of the booking.

10The Applicant said that he was married with four children and his wife was looking after the farm while he was away. He said that other members of his family did not want to go on holiday with him and that he did not know anyone in Australia.

11During questioning by Customs Officers the Applicant produced a business card showing that he was ""Chairman / Managing Director"" of ""Agro-Allied Farms Limited"" with a Nigerian address.

12Enquiries by Customs Officers revealed that there was no booking in the name of the Applicant at the Garden Lodge Motel in Haberfield.

13Customs Officers suspected that the Applicant was internally concealing narcotics and requested consent for an internal search. The Applicant declined and the matter was then referred to the Australian Federal Police.

14AFP agents attended the airport and conducted a recorded interview with the Applicant. The Applicant declined to consent to undergo an internal search, stating that he could not undergo an X-ray for various medical reasons. The Applicant requested an interpreter and said he wished to contact the Nigerian embassy and a lawyer. He also requested to be deported from Australia.

15An amount of US$1,848 was found in the Applicant's possession.

16The Applicant was taken to St George Hospital. He continued to decline consent to undergo an internal search.

17At about 11:27pm AFP agents were granted an order for detention pursuant to s 219(T)(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) authorising the Applicant's detention for a 48-hour period. Soon afterwards the Applicant spoke with a solicitor.

18Police further interviewed the Applicant but he continued to decline to consent to an internal search.

19At about 9:40pm on the 30 November, the Applicant requested to use the toilet at which time he passed a number of foreign objects into a bedpan. Shortly after this occurred the Applicant consented to an internal search. A CT scan revealed a number of foreign objects inside his stomach.

20The recorded interview was recommenced. When asked what he believed was inside the objects he said that they contained drugs. He was then placed under arrest.

21AFP agents seized a number of items found in the Applicant's possession. These included the Applicant's Nigerian passport issued on 20 August 2008 which noted the issue of a three month visitor's visa issued by the Australian High Commission in Arcardia, Pretoria, South Africa, on 5 November 2009, and two ""Agro-Alliance Farms Limited"" business cards in the name ""Chief Joseph Kolawole Kuti, Chairman/Managing Director"".

22Between 9:40pm on 30 November 2009 and 3:07pm on 2 December 2009, the Applicant passed a total of 100 foreign objects from his body.

23After a further CT scan which indicated that all the objects had been removed, the Applicant was discharged from the hospital.

24When taken into custody the Applicant declined to be interviewed further.

25The objects were forensically examined. The objects consisted of compressed powder wrapped in plastic wrap. The total gross weight of the powder was 796.9 grams. Further analysis revealed that the powder contained heroin of 56.8% purity. The total pure weight of heroin was 452.6 grams.

26The ""street value"" of the heroin seized from the Applicant has been estimated by the AFP as being between $528,010 and $905,200.

27Records from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship indicate that the Applicant had not previously travelled to Australia.

The offender's account of the offending:

28The Applicant told the probation officer that he had borrowed $US10,000 from a man so that he could purchase a quantity of rice that he could re- sell. He said that he had been ""tricked"" by this person who ""disappeared"" with his money. He said that as he was unable to meet the debt that he had incurred he became involved in the importation of illicit drugs in order that the debt be cancelled. He said he intended that some of the monies would be retained for medical expenses. He said in evidence during the proceedings on sentence that he was having breathing difficulties.

29The Applicant told the probation officer that he initially refused to become involved. However, he said that he had been threatened with death if he did not co-operate. He said that he acted out of fear. In evidence he said that there was constant harassment and that he had no choice.

30The Applicant said that he was ultimately taken to a hotel and instructed how to conceal the drugs. He said he was told that the drug was cocaine. After he swallowed the drugs he was taken to a hotel in Lagos. All arrangements for travel had been organised by others.

31The Applicant did not give entirely consistent accounts of events in Nigeria. He told the psychologist, John Taylor, who examined him, that the person from whom he had borrowed the money introduced him to a man who told him that if he brought drugs to Australia he would give him money when he returned to Nigeria to enable him to repay the debt. He said that he had rejected this proposition but his family was threatened with being killed. He said that he took this threat very seriously and became very afraid. He said that he did not commit the offence willingly. 

32His Honour's conclusions about these matters was as follows:

Whilst I have some reservations about the offender's evidence concerning the origin of his indebtedness, I accept his evidence, on balance, that he had owed money to others and that he had hoped that, by importing the heroin, that that debt be expunged. I accept his evidence that his decision to become involved was made against a background of threats made to him. The offender comes from an impoverished background. There is nothing before me to suggest that he had the ability to organise or fund an importation of this scale or to procure the drug. I accept the offender's evidence that his role was to internally conceal the drug and bring it into Australia where others would collect it. His role was that of a courier.

...

... Having considered the various accounts given by the offender and his evidence during the proceedings on sentence I am of the view that it is likely that his ultimate decision to become involved was precipitated by threats towards him. It is however difficult to determine the extent to which his will was overborne. He has entered a plea of guilty which is an admission that he was not acting under duress. Further the offender himself acknowledged that he had other options and could have notified the authorities and has expressed regret that he did not take that course.

33Although the Crown had argued that the Applicant should be found to have been an importer of the drugs his Honour found that he should be regarded as a courier. His Honour went on to say, however:

This pursuit of a label however should not obscure what it is the offender did. The offender played a crucial role in the importation of a significant quantity of illicit drugs.

Subjective features

34The Applicant had no prior criminal record in Australia, and his Honour accepted that he had no criminal record in Nigeria. His Honour noted, however, that good record is generally of less weight where the Court is dealing with the dissemination of large quantities of narcotic drugs.

35At the time of sentence the Applicant was 69 years of age and is now 70 years of age. He resides in a village in Nigeria. He has four children although there are inconsistencies in the evidence offered by the Applicant about them. One or more of the children appears to be a minor.

36His wife was apparently ill before he came to Australia and died before he was sentenced. The family was in a financially poor state. He had not had sufficient money to enable his children to attend school. He gave inconsistent information about his occupation, saying first that he was a farmer who owned a coca farm, and subsequently that he was a tailor from which he earned the Nigerian equivalent of about AUS $866 per annum. He did not have any history of alcohol or illicit drug use. He suffered from hypertension and chronic nose bleeding. 

37The psychologist noted that at the time of testing the Applicant was suffering from depression which appeared to be reactive to his incarceration in Australia. His Honour accepted that the Applicant required treatment for his depression. 

Remarks on Sentence

38Having made the factual findings and noted the subjective features detailed earlier his Honour made the following determinations in relation to the sentence:

(a)he found that his remorse was genuine;

(b)he found that the Applicant's plea was made at the earliest opportunity, and discounted the sentence by 25%;

(c)he noted the maximum penalty, and the need for general deterrence for offences of the type charged;

(d)in relation to the objective gravity of the offence he found that the quantity of the drug was substantial which was a matter known to the Applicant, that his role was that of a courier, and that he was expecting to receive a substantial monetary reward equivalent to him of many years' income;

(e)he noted the Applicant had no prior criminal record but said that that was of less weight where a court was dealing with dissemination of large quantities of narcotic drugs;

(f)he noted aspects of hardship including the Applicant's health, his wife's death, and his isolation away from his family and country;

(g)he was mindful of the limitations of making references to statistics of sentences.

The Appeal

39The only ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Nevertheless, the Applicant submitted that considerations of duress and hardship to the Applicant of his present incarceration should have resulted in a lesser sentence. Since actual error was not asserted (although the submission in relation to duress suggested error) it must be taken that the real complaint was that the weight attached by the Sentencing judge to these two matters led to an excessive sentence. The difficulty with this type of submission is emphasised by what Johnson J (with whom Tobias AJA and Hall J agreed) said in Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215:

[58] This court is generally reluctant to entertain favourably grounds of appeal which contend that there was a failure to give ""adequate weight"" to a factor on sentence: Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]. Matters of weight are for the sentencing Judge. Unless it be demonstrated that the sentencing Judge placed so little weight on the duress finding that the sentence fell outside the appropriate exercise of sentencing discretion, there is no basis for appellate intervention: El-Charr v R at [28].

40The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing judge did not indicate how the duress which was found impacted on the assessment of the objective gravity. The Applicant pointed to what was said in Tiknius as follows:

[59]A significant feature of the submission in support of the first ground of appeal is that her Honour moved from strongly favourable findings on the duress issue to the imposition of sentence, without any assessment of the impact of the duress finding on the objective gravity of the Applicant's offences. In my view, this complaint is made out in this case.

[60]Her Honour's acceptance of the Applicant's evidence was a practical starting point in an assessment of the objective gravity of the Applicant's offences. What was then necessary, to comply with relevant principles, was an articulated assessment by her Honour of the impact of the finding of duress upon the objective gravity and moral culpability of the Applicant's offences. This did not require an elaborate and detailed analysis. However, some analysis, and an expression of conclusions, was required. It did not happen in this case.

[61]The very fact that an unusual and favourable finding was being made, which would operate in the interests of the Applicant, required analysis and conclusions with respect to moral culpability and objective seriousness of the offences. In light of her Honour's findings, this was a most important feature in this case, bearing upon the motivation of the Applicant to become involved in serious criminal activity.

41I have set out above at [32] what his Honour said concerning the matter of duress. In my opinion those remarks contained ""some analysis, and an expression of conclusions"". It may be inferred from those remarks that his Honour concluded that the Applicant's will was not overborne to the extent that the duress may have provided a defence to the offence charged, and that the threats influenced his actions but that he could have dealt with them by notifying the appropriate authorities. It may also be inferred that his Honour found that the duress was a mitigating factor to some extent, but not such as to remove the need for deterrence. In that regard his Honour observed in the passage immediately following what is set out in [32] above:

As I have indicated, the governing principle under s16A(1) is the imposition of a sentence that is of a ""severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"".

The offence is a prevalent one and one that is not always easy to detect. Offences of this kind have a significant impact upon illegal drug use in Australia and are the cause of substantial harm to the Australian community. A sentence must be imposed which will be regarded and seen by the community as carrying a strong element of deterrence.

42I do not consider there was any error in the approach of the Sentencing Judge to the matter of duress.

43The Applicant drew particular attention to the hardship he is experiencing, particularly because of his age, his health, and his being absent from his family particularly as his wife died after he was incarcerated here. These hardship matters were expressly taken into account by his Honour. 

44In addition, in R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 Hunt J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL said) at 239:

There were a number of subjective facts which the judge took into account. The respondent is incarcerated in a foreign country, living amidst a foreign language and a foreign culture. He is isolated from any outside contact. However, with all due respect to views to the contrary which may have been expressed by others, I do not consider that very much weight should be given to that particular circumstance.

The fact is that any person who comes to this country specifically and quite deliberately to commit a serious crime here (as did the respondent) has no justifiable cause for complaint when, as the inevitable consequence of the discovery of his crime, he is obliged to remain incarcerated in this country, with its language and culture foreign to him, isolated from outside contact. The respondent has nevertheless responded well in custody, and favourable reports were tendered as to his attendance at English classes and as to his rapport with his fellow prisoners and with prison officers.

This approach was reaffirmed in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2011) 205 A Crim R 1 at [265] where McClellan CJ at CL said these matters were of ""strictly limited"" significance.

45In further support for his submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive Mr O'Neil of Counsel for the Applicant took the Court to the decision of this Court in De La Rosa. He submitted, in particular, that the Applicant's case should be regarded as falling within Group 3 of importing a trafficable/marketable quantity as discussed at [223]. That paragraph of the judgment is as follows:

The sentencing range for cases in this group is 3.75 - 6 years (head sentence) and 2 - 4.25 years (non-parole period). The majority of the offenders were mere couriers. Many expected a financial reward, or were promised relief of a debt, measured in the thousands of dollars. Virtually all entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and received discounts of up to 25%. Many of the offenders in this group suffered adverse personal circumstances including drug use and dependency (Chong, Hoang, Tyn, Petrosyan, Blay, Salcedo, Le, Fisher, Berlitone), physical and mental health problems (Chong, Hoang, Danial, Petrosyan, Le, Seng, Ntsi) financial problems (Hoang, Huynh, Barany, Nhu Thi Ho, Thanh Nhu Ho, Chea & Ors, Le) and familial/relationship problems (Chong, Tyn, Blay, Chea & Ors, Le). The quantities of narcotics involved in the offences tend to lie at the more conservative end of the marketable (or trafficable, as it was known under the Customs Act) threshold. Petrosyan, which I have placed in this group, is something of an anomaly. It involved a high marketable quantity of cocaine and a role well above that of mere courier. On the other hand, it has features typical to this group, including a plea of guilty and adverse personal circumstances. Without the significant assistance provided by the offender in that case, I would have placed this decision into the second group of cases.

46Whilst it is certainly true that the Applicant can be fitted into the descriptions contained in that category he can equally be placed in what McClellan CJ at CL described as Group 2 of those charged with trafficable or marketable quantity as follows:

[221] The head sentences in this group range from 6 to 9 years. The non-parole periods range from 3 years to just over 5 years. The quantity of drug does not seem to be of particular significance. The significant factors which are common are the role played by the offender, the anticipated reward, the nature and timing of any plea, as well as the level of any assistance provided. The majority of the offenders in this group were mere couriers (Mirzaee, X, Do, Bartlett, Mattheyer, Radebe, Jimson, Heryadi, P , Anna Le, De Campos, Toure, Kaldor) although some had more senior roles (Pham low level importer; Saputra principal, Boyd significantly involved; Tran involved in management but not a principal; Nikolovska facilitator). Discounts were allowed in Mirzaee (plea 25%), X (plea and cooperation 35%), Thom (plea 10%, cooperation 25%), Radebe (plea 25%), Pham (plea 25%), P (plea and assistance 40%), Anna Le (plea, assumed discount 25%), De Campos (plea, assumed discount 20%, offer of assistance 5%), Toure (plea and cooperation 25%), Saputra (late plea 10%), Viera (plea 25%) and Taylor (plea and assistance 35%). In many other cases discounts were applied without being specified in numerical terms. The sentences in Kaldor and Tran were imposed following successful Crown appeals.

47McClellan CJ at CL stressed that he was not writing a guideline judgment, but was collecting previous decisions which might prove as a useful resource for judges sentencing for drug importation offences - see at [196] and [203]. He also said at [200]:

After analysis, I have placed the sentences into relevant groupings. I have taken this approach for ease of understanding by others. Of course the appropriate sentence for a particular offence will depend on all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The groupings are merely an attempt to facilitate an understanding of the available information by reference to the common features of offenders and offences and the sentence imposed. There will inevitably be anomalies and others exercising their own judgement may have placed one or other of the decisions into a different group.

48I do not consider that the determination in the present matter is assisted by the Applicant's approach of endeavouring to place himself within a particular grouping in De La Rosa and concluding that, because the present sentence exceeds the range in that group, the sentence is manifestly excessive. Even if it could be said that the case fits into the third group for marketable quantity the sentence imposed by the judge was sufficiently close to the range of sentencing in that group that manifest excess could not be demonstrated.

Conclusion

49In my opinion the following orders should be made:

(1) Leave to appeal granted.

(2) Appeal dismissed.

50GARLING J:I agree with the judgment of Davies J, and with the orders which his Honour proposes.

		14 April 2012",2012-04-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708343,R V KADDOUR & ZREIKA [2012] NSWDC 50,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The accused are both charged with offences relating to the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The Crown case against them depends largely on intercepted telephone calls. The Crime Commission intercepted the calls and recorded them in electronic files using a format known as PCM. As part of their preparation for their defence the accused sought, by way of subpoena addressed to the Crime Commission, ""copies"" - I emphasise the word copies - of the recordings of the intercepts. What were provided however, were not copies of the recordings in the PCM format, but versions of the recordings compressed into the more familiar MP3 format. 

2The evidence suggests that it was not until 20 October 2011, when an affidavit of an officer of the Crime Commission was served on the accused, that anyone on the defence side understood that their assumption that they had got copies of the recordings in the format in which those recordings were held by the Crime Commission, was wrong. 

3Before 20 October 2011, whilst still acting under the misapprehension, the defence engaged an expert, a Mr Gosh, to identify a number of matters, including in particular, whether there had been any editing of the telephone calls. It appeared to that expert that there had been such editing. An application was therefore foreshadowed that the defence would seek a permanent stay of proceedings on the basis that they could not get a fair trial because the case against them was based on edited telephone calls. 

4It was this application which prompted the affidavit of an officer of the Crime Commission of 20 October 2011. In that affidavit it was explained that the appearance of editing came about because of the format in which the recordings had been produced to the defence. I repeat that it appears to have been this affidavit which told the defence for the first time that there were in existence original recordings, in a different format to that which had been provided to them. This required the vacation of the trial which was about to start. It was vacated with the consent of all parties. 

5What I have before me today is an application by both accused that the proceedings should be stayed until the costs wasted as a result of them being provided with MP3 versions of the relevant telephone calls are paid by the prosecution, in circumstances where the defence was not made aware that this was not the format in which the Crime Commission held the original recordings.

6This is not a case where the defence suggests mala fides on the part of the prosecution or any investigating agency. The defence says that there has been some confusion, and so does the prosecution. But the defence says that if it got what it asked for by way of subpoena, namely copies of the relevant recordings, then the problem which led to the trial date being vacated and costs being wasted would not have arisen. 

7I need to explain some technical matters here. When the recordings are made, as well as there being an electronic recording of the sounds, each file contains what is referred to as metadata; information such as the date and the time the audio recording was made. When the copies were made by the Crime Commission in the MP3 format, such metadata was lost. It is the defence case that a request for a copy of a recording, when that recording is in a digital format, is not satisfied by providing a version of that recording which may be audibly indistinguishable from the original, but which does not contain the metadata. 

8Another technical aspect which is important is that the compression associated with an MP3 file may well give rise to the appearance, when that recording is analysed by an expert, of the recording having been edited. 

9The defence submission is that if you supply a copy of a recording and do not include the metadata, and compress the file which gives the appearance of editing, then you have not supplied what is asked for, that is a copy. 

10The prosecution, on the other hand, says that it is common knowledge that investigating agencies in Australia do not record in the MP3 format and so any decent expert retained by the defence to examine the relevant recordings, to see if they have been edited, should have known that he or she was not dealing with recordings in the original format where those recordings were in the MP3 format. 

11I note that there is evidence to establish that the MP3 format is not used by investigating agencies in Australia in the affidavit of Jacques Kim Yuen Song of 13 April 2012. On the other hand, the expert retained by the defence, Mr Gosh, appears to have had an extensive career in intercepting and analysing telephone intercepts, including having been a New South Wales police officer, and so it would appear that Mr Sung's understanding is not shared by everyone with expertise in this area. In any case to say that Mr Gosh is incompetent as an expert, which is what the prosecution suggests, is somewhat besides the point.

12The prosecution also says that if the subpoena had asked for recordings by specifying that they should be provided in the original format, then they would have been provided. Of course that assumes that the defence would foresee that the Crime Commission would not provide exact copies, something which I do not regard as being reasonable foreseeable. Of course none of the trouble which has arisen would have arisen had that been done, but the prosecution explained that recordings were not provided in the original format because compression of the files into the MP3 format means that fewer discs are required to be used, and that whilst software capable of playing MP3 files exists on all modern computers, in order to play PCM files, the computer user would have to download software from the internet first. 

13Whilst the Crime Commission appears to have copied the files into MP3 format to assist, the evidence before me does tend to suggest there was not a great advantage in doing what they did. For example, by compressing the recordings, the storage requirements were reduced by only about half and it was a relatively simple matter for Mr Lloyd's instructing solicitor to download the required software from the internet - at no charge I should add - and then, after seeking some further clarification from the Crime Commission, using that software to listen to the recordings in the PCM format. So whilst I accept that the Crime Commission appears to have been trying to be helpful, it is the case, with the benefit of hindsight which I appreciate the Crime Commission did not have, that the benefit which flowed from using the MP3 format was not all that great. 

14Of course before the era of digital recording, to copy something almost invariably meant that there were differences between the copy and the original. I used the example, in the course of submissions, of the Mona Lisa. If I asked someone to copy the Mona Lisa for me that person could either photograph it, or use their own paints and paintbrushes to do a version of it, but the copy would not be identical to the original. But in the digital age, digital files can be copied identically. At their most basic, a digital recording is a series of ones and zeros and they can be accurately reproduced so that a true digital copy of a digital file is indistinguishable from the original.

15It was easily technically possible for the Crime Commission to provide recordings which were identical to the original and, given that the subpoena asked for copies, that is what should have been done. I repeat however, that there is no suggestion that the Crime Commission was motivated by malice in doing what it did. It is accepted that the Crime Commission was trying to be helpful.

16What I will do now is speak about the history of applications of this kind because it is important to note two things; that fault must be demonstrated and that successful applications of this kind should be rare and exceptional. 

17The history of applications of this kind begins with The Queen v Mosley (1992) 28 NSWLR 735. In that case the District Court trial was adjourned on the application of the prosecution because two material witnesses had become unexpectedly unavailable. The prosecution had given the defence no notice of this. The trial Judge granted the adjournment sought by the prosecution but only on condition that the prosecution pay the wasted costs incurred by the accused. The prosecution successfully appealed, arguing that the trial Judge had no power to make the order which had been made. However, the Court of Criminal Appeal also noted that a trial Judge could effectively bring about the same result through making orders which he or she did have the power to make. The Court of Criminal Appeal suggested that if the trial Judge made an order conditionally staying the further proceedings until costs had been paid, then that would have achieved the same result and would have been within power. 

18Since then, orders of the kind suggested by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Mosley have been made in various jurisdictions. I was referred in the course of argument to orders made in: the ACT, R v Bui [2011] ACTSC 102; South Australia, R v Ulman-Naruniec (2003) 143 A Crim R 531; and of course many decisions in New South Wales.

19It has to be said that the decisions of the various courts do not always articulate the test for a trial Judge to apply, in identical terms. What is common however, is that orders such as those sought by the accused are to be made only in the most exceptional circumstances and that what the accused must demonstrate is injustice or unfairness for which the prosecuting authority should be held responsible. 

20The accused in this case were content to rely on the test as articulated by Justice Fullerton in R v Selim [2007] NSWSC 154 at [57] where her Honour said,

""I am content to proceed on the basis there needs to be demonstrated an identifiable injustice for which it can sensibly be said that the prosecuting authorities should be held responsible before a temporary stay is ordered, given that the effect of ordering a stay is to impose upon them the costs of previous proceedings before they may be permitted to prosecute again.""

21It is clear that the accused must demonstrate fault. In Pretroulias v R (2007) 176 A Crim R 302, the Court of Criminal Appeal spoke of default or impropriety on the part of the prosecution, and further, unfairness which cannot be established without proof of fault on the part of the prosecution. The ACT and South Australian authorities which I referred to earlier also seemed to require fault on the part of the prosecution. In Ulman-Naruniec the Court held that the trial Judge was right in concluding that the prosecutor was in flagrant breach of its duty of disclosure and in Bui the Court found that there was fault on the part of the prosecution which caused the vacation of the trial date.

22Before addressing issues concerning fault and unfairness in this case, I should mention one issue which turned out to be irrelevant. That issue concerned this circumstance: what is sought in this case is that there be a stay until the Crown pays the wasted costs, but it is not suggested that the Crown, in the sense of the prosecuting agency, the DPP, is at fault. That is, however not something that the prosecution can take advantage of. The Crown, very properly, referred me to a decision of R v Fisher (2003) 56 NSWLR 625. In that case the fault was of an investigating agency, in that case ASIC. Simpson J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, made it clear that fault on the part of prosecuting authorities, including ASIC, is enough to form the basis of a successful application of this kind. That case concerned about the failure to produce a file. Her Honour said at para [19]:

""I will here note that, in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the file was in the possession of, and should have been earlier produced by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The fact is that such fault as there was was on the part of the prosecuting authorities. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, as to the party to the proceedings, has to live with that fact.""

23So although the money would, by any order of mine, have to be paid by the DPP, who it appears is blameless, the DPP has to live with any finding of mine (if I make it) that the Crime Commission was at fault.

24As I explained, the Crime Commission was trying to be helpful. Although it did not strictly comply with a subpoena served upon it, I would not regard the initial provision of recordings in a format other than that in which they were originally made as being such a flagrant breach of duty or misbehaviour as to constitute fault for the purpose of this application. It led to confusion and it led ultimately to wasted expense. But there was no negligence of any gross kind that would satisfy me that the original decision to supply MP3 copies of the recordings was a serious fault. 

25I am satisfied that fault can be demonstrated in an appropriate case where what is established is inadvertence or omission or incompetence. Fault could be demonstrated where a prosecuting agency for example deliberately withholds exculpatory material from an accused person, but I do not read the authorities as requiring positive acts of this kind before appropriate fault can be demonstrated. Just as the criminal law punishes negligence, whether it be in the case of manslaughter, driving, or sexual assault, fault can be established in an application of this kind through negligence as well. 

26Mr Lloyd QC, whose submissions Mr Brewer adopted, took me to some communications made by the defence to the Crime Commission in April, 2011. On 1 April Miss Abigail Bannister wrote to the Crime Commission. She sought some information regarding the nature of the audio recordings which had been produced on subpoena. In that letter she raised the difficulties she had with respect to both outgoing and incoming calls and she asked what reference timepiece was used by the New South Wales Crime Commission in establishing the start of each intercepted call. It is important to note that Miss Bannister sought information about what she referred to as the ""reference timepiece"" because by copying the files in MP3 format, the apparent timing of the calls was altered. 

27This should have alerted the Crime Commission to the problems which have now become apparent. The simple response to the question as to which reference timepiece was used appears in a letter of the Crime Commission dated 7 April, 2011. The answer is succinctly given; ""eastern standard time"". After that on 8 April an affidavit was prepared on the part of the accused by Dorian Beaver, a solicitor then working for Miss Bannister. In that affidavit which was prepared in support of a notice of motion seeking a vacation of a trial then listed for 23 May, Mr Beaver refers to difficulties which he has had in analysing the recordings. In particular he prepared a schedule in which he compared call charge records with the time and date given on the audio files which had been produced on subpoena. He noted that there were some calls which were unmatched. It now appears that at least part of Mr Beaver's difficulties resulted from the use by the Crime Commission of the MP3 format in complying with the subpoena. Indeed the affidavit of Jacques Kim Jung He Sung of 20 October 2011, in response to a report of Mr Gosh, the accused's expert, criticises Mr Gosh for relying on the date and time stamp on the MP3 files. He says, this is not a reliable way to match the CCR with the audio; (CCR of course being the abbreviation for call charge records.) 

28So by mid April, difficulties which the Crime Commission had caused by its choice of format in compliance with subpoena were made known and a proper reading of the letter and affidavit would have alerted an officer of the Crime Commission with relevant knowledge to the problems the Crime Commission had caused.

29I should skip ahead here to September and October 2011, because it was on 5 September 2011 that a letter was sent by Miss Bannister in which she told the Crime Commission for the first time that she was arranging for the recordings to be examined by an expert.

30Taking that letter in isolation I do not regard the failure of anyone in the Crime Commission to respond to that letter by revealing the difference in formats as significant because the letter only sought permission to provide the material to the expert, that permission being granted. It was not until the results of that expert's examination were provided to the Crime Commission that the Crime Commission finally realised what was going on and it was that that led to the disclosure on 20 October 2011 of the difference in the formats. 

31So I do not consider that the Crime Commission is relevantly at fault as regards the failure by them to realise what was going on from the letter of 5 September 2011. But what about what happened back in April? As I have explained, in early April the defence were saying things which should have led officers in the Crime Commission to understand that the defence were barking up the wrong tree. The letter and affidavit make it clear that the defence were relying on the date and time stamp provided on the MP3 files when, as Mr Sung's affidavit later makes clear, they should not have been doing so. 

32After barking up the wrong tree the defence then went on a wild goose chase from early April till late October. Various employees of the accused's solicitor attempted to correlate the call charge records with the time and date stamps on the MP3 recordings, experts were retained, and money was spent, which has ultimately turned out to be wasted. 

33This is a rare and exceptional case, not only because the particular problem of a technical kind which is at the heart of this proceeding is something that I am not aware of anyone coming across before, but also because, more relevantly to this application, the Crime Commission has acted in a way it should not have. Having caused the problem, albeit innocently in the first place, it failed to correct the clear misunderstanding on the part of the defence, a misunderstanding the Crime Commission was responsible for, when it had the opportunity to do that in April last year.

34As I said, deliberate misconduct is not required before fault can be established and fault can be established where the defence establishes or satisfies me that the Crime Commission has failed to do what it should have done and that that failure is particularly serious. It is particularly serious in this case because of the consequences which have come about and because it should have been clear to the Crime Commission from April 2011 that it had caused the problems which the defence faced. 

35I do not look at individual officers at the Crime Commission and say that it is his fault or her fault, and some of the people involved in this process who are employed at the Crime Commission are probably blameless. But whatever happened in April, 2011 which led to the failure of the Crime Commission to tell the defence that it was barking up the wrong tree, as an organisation the Crime Commission was at fault and seriously so. It is unfair for the accused to have to bear the financial consequences of the Crime Commission's serious mistake.

36As a consequence I make the orders sought in the notice of motion, that is that the further trial of these accused be stayed until the Crown pays reasonable costs of the defence as incurred by reason of the trial date of 10 October, 2011 being vacated on 24 October 2011. 

37As will be apparent from this judgment those reasonable costs would be limited to what occurred after the misunderstanding was not corrected by the Crime Commission following the affidavit of Mr Beaver being filed and served.

		26 April 2012",2012-04-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2708344,New South Wales Crime Commission v Li Zhang [2012] NSWSC 316,"Judgment
Background1On 25 March 2011, on the application of the NSW Crime Commission (""the Commission"") orders were made by this Court against the defendant Li Zhang pursuant to the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (""the Act"") in relation to property known as Unit 15, 9 Pitt Street, Mortdale (""the Mortdale property""). Those orders included an order pursuant to s 10A of the Act preventing disposal of the Mortdale property (""the restraining order"").
2The restraining order remains in force at the present time and was made having regard to the contents of an affidavit of Jonathon Lee Spark sworn on 25 March 2011. That affidavit deposed to a number of facts, on the basis of which Mr Spark suspected that either:  
(a)statements made by the defendant to a home loan provider in an application for a loan were false, were known by her to be false, and were made for the purposes of dishonestly obtaining a loan from that home loan provider for the purposes of purchasing the property; or alternatively
(b)an Income Tax Return lodged by the defendant to the Australian Taxation Office for the year ending 30 June 2004 was false, was known by the defendant to be false, and was lodged by her for the purposes of dishonestly obtaining the benefit of paying less income tax than she would have had a liability to pay had she correctly declared her greater taxable income. 
3On 6 February 2012 the defendant filed a notice of motion seeking that the restraining order be set aside.  It was this notice of motion which was listed for hearing before me on 29 March 2012.  In short, the defendant sought that the restraining order be set aside on the basis that if there had been any dishonest conduct, she was neither involved in it, nor aware of it.  In this regard, paragraph 8(c) of the defendant's affidavit of 5 February 2012 which was filed in support of the motion was in the following terms:  
Gladiator Home Loans provided the home loan for the property in the sum of $240,000. Annexed herewith and marked ""C"" is their approval advice. This loan was negotiated by contact between my husband, Henley Han, and a broker named Tony Nguyen. Tony Nguyen was a broker for Gladiator Home Loans. I did not see nor sign the Loan Application Form. 
4At the commencement of the proceedings on 29 March 2012 Mr Temby QC, who appeared on behalf of the Commission, filed a notice of motion in Court seeking (inter alia) a further restraining order.  In doing so, Mr Temby explained that what the Commission now sought was a restraining order based upon the fact that the defendant's interest in the Mortdale property is serious crime derived property, not as a result of any serious crime related activity of the defendant, but as a result of such activity on the part of her husband, Henley Han (""Han""), either alone or in combination with Tony Nguyen (""Nguyen""), a Mortgage Broker.  
5In circumstances where there were two motions before the Court, Mr Temby submitted that the Commission's motion should be dealt with first.  Mr Jones, who appeared with Mr Clark for the defendant, did not argue against that course but made it clear that the orders sought by the Commission were opposed.  Mr Jones further submitted that if I came to the view that such orders were appropriate, they should be granted on terms which allowed the defendant to access her equity in the Mortdale if property to meet her reasonable legal expenses.  Mr Temby indicated that if that issue arose, he would require an opportunity to consider it and obtain instructions.  
6In these circumstances, I proceeded to hear the Commission's motion.  
The evidence7Mr Temby relied upon three affidavits in support of the motion, namely:
(i)an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 9 March 2012 (""the first Spark affidavit"");
(ii)a further affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 28 March 2012 (""the second Spark affidavit"");  and
(iii)an affidavit of the defendant sworn 5 February 2012 (""the defendant's affidavit"").
8The majority of the evidence relied upon by the Commission is contained in Exhibit JLS-1 to the first Spark affidavit.  
9The first Spark affidavit contained some typographical and formatting errors which are corrected by the second Spark affidavit.  I should also note that although a further affidavit of the defendant sworn on 29 March 2012 was filed in Court, this affidavit is relevant only to the application foreshadowed by Mr Jones as to the terms on which any orders should be made and was not relied upon either party on the hearing of the Commission's motion.    
10The evidence relied upon by the Commission discloses the following.  
11The defendant and Han are married.  On 11 September 2003, a Mortgage Loan Application (part of Exhibit JLS-1/Tab1) (""the application"") was completed in the name of the defendant for the stated purpose of borrowing an amount of $240,000.00 from Gladiator Home Loans (""Gladiator"") to assist in the purchase of the Mortdale property, which was offered as security for the loan.
12The defendant has stated that the signature on the application is not hers and that she did not complete that document (defendant's affidavit at paragraph 8(c)).  She has further stated (in the same paragraph) that the loan was negotiated between Han and Tony Nguyen (""Nguyen""), the latter being Mortgage Broker for Gladiator.
13The application stated that the defendant was employed by a company called Rovil Pty Limited (""Rovil"") and was paid an annual salary of $55,016.00 per annum.  
14Exhibit JLS-1/Tab 3 discloses:
(a)that the defendant has been a director of Rovil since 26 February 2002;(b)that Han has been a director and secretary of Rovil since 16 August 2000;(c)that Han is the sole shareholder of Rovil; and(c)that the Mortdale property is Rovil's principal place of business and registered office.
15The application was supported by a series of other documents (which also form part of Exhibit JLS-1/Tab 1).  They included:
(a)an ""Employment Verification"" form which bears the name of Nguyen and a signature next to the words ""completed by"", and which purported to verify that the defendant's employment with Rovil, and the amount of her salary, had been confirmed.  Han's name appears as the person who was contacted for the purposes of that confirmation;
(b)a document on the letterhead of Rovil, signed ""Henley Han, Sales Manager"", certifying that the defendant had been employed by Rovil as a saleswoman for two years and earned a weekly wage of $1,058.00;
(c)a document entitled ""Payment Summary Report"" showing that for the year ending 30 June 2003 the defendant was paid a sum of $54,349.00 from Rovil;
(d)a document entitled ""Loan Submission Summary"" dated 2 October 2003 confirming Nguyen as the contact person in respect of the loan.
16A title search (Exhibit JLS-1/Tab 2) establishes that the defendant is the registered proprietor of the Mortdale property, it having been transferred to her on 22 November 2003.
17Documents obtained from the Australian Taxation Office (Exhibit JLS-1/Tab 4) establish that in the financial year ending 30 June 2004 (that being the financial year in which the application was submitted) Rovil's total salary and wage expenses were $6,600.00.  In the defendant's taxation return for the year ending 30 June 2004 it was declared that she was employed by Rovil and received salary and wages from Rovil totalling $6,600.00.  It was further declared that her taxable income for that financial year was $6,530.00.    
Relevant legislative provisions18Section 10A of the Act is in (inter alia) the following terms:10AProceedings for restraining orders

(1)An interest in property is serious crime derived property if: 
(a)it is all or part of the proceeds of a serious crime related activity, or
(b)it is all or part of the proceeds of the disposal of or other dealing in serious crime derived property, or
(c)it was wholly or partly acquired using serious crime derived property......
(5)An interest in property ceases to be serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property:
(a)when it is acquired by a person for sufficient consideration without knowing and in circumstances that would not arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the interest was, at the time of acquisition, serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property;.......
The submissions of the parties21Section 10A(5) of the Act mandates the making of a restraining order if a number of pre-requisites are satisfied.  For the purposes of the present case, those pre-requisites are that:
(a)the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer;(b)the affidavit states that the authorised officer suspects that (in this case) the defendant has acquired serious crime derived property because of the serious crime related activity of another person;(c)the affidavit sets out the grounds upon which the suspicion is based; and(d)the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit, and any evidence filed by the defendant, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
22Mr Jones did not dispute that the matters in (a), (b) and (c) were made out.  He helpfully confined his argument to two propositions.  Firstly, he submitted that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion held by Mr Spark.  Secondly, he submitted that the Mortdale property had, having regard to the provisions of s 9(5)(a) of the Act, ceased to become serious crime derived property. 
23As to the first issue, Mr Temby submitted that the evidence established reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion that the defendant had acquired serious crime derived property as a result of the serious crime related activity of Han and/or Nguyen.  Specifically, Mr Temby submitted that the evidence established reasonable grounds for the suspicion that that an offence had been committed, by Han and/or Nguyen, against s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900. Although that section is now repealed, it was, at the material time, in force and was in the following terms:
178BBObtaining money etc by false or misleading statements 
(1)Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 

24Having regard to the term of imprisonment for which s 178BB(1) provides, the offence created by that section is a ""serious criminal offence"" within the meaning of s 6(2)(d) of the Act.  
25As to the second issue, Mr Temby submitted that there was an onus on the defendant to adduce evidence in support of her reliance upon s 9(5)(a), and that such onus had not been discharged.  He further submitted that the evidence upon which Mr Spark based his suspicion would lead me to conclude that the circumstances surrounding the defendant's acquisition of the Mortdale property were such as to arouse the reasonable suspicion of which s 9(5)(a) speaks.  
26In relation to the first issue, Mr Jones' position was essentially confined to  one proposition.  He submitted that the evidence was not sufficient to establish reasonable grounds for the suspicion held by Mr Spark because, in order to reach that point, it was necessary for the Commission to show a causal nexus between the making of a false statement in the application, and the payment of the money by Gladiator.  At paragraph 17 of his written submissions, Mr Jones put the submission in this way:  
It is essential for the Commission to show a nexus between the false/misleading statement and the benefit. The Court cannot assume that Gladiator Home Loans Pty Limited acted on the false/misleading statement and there is no fact that would warrant such an assumption. The simple making of a false or misleading statement is not sufficient to ground the offence. 
The facts that ground Spark' (sic) suspicion are insufficient for his suspicion to be reasonable. As particularised the Commission must demonstrate a factual nexus between the false statement and the obtaining of a bank loan from Gladiator Home Loans Pty Limited.

27In support of this submission Mr Jones cited the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Ho & Szeto (1989) 39 A Crim R 145.  He also relied upon the decision of the High Court in George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104. 
28In respect of the second issue, Mr Jones submitted that in circumstances where the defendant had not herself been charged with any criminal offence, the evidence, at its highest, pointed to nothing more than the fact that she obtained a loan which had been arranged by Han or alternatively by Han and Nguyen.  He submitted that this evidence was not sufficient to arouse the reasonable suspicion to which s 9(5)(a) refers.
Resolution of the issuesAre there reasonable grounds for the suspicion held by Mr Spark?29In George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 the High Court made a number of observations in relation to the concepts of ""reasonable grounds"" and ""suspicion"". As to the former, the Court observed (at p112):
When a statute prescribes that there must be ""reasonable grounds"" for a state of mind - including suspicion and belief - it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person.
30As to the latter the Court observed (at p115):
Suspicion, as Lord Devlin said in Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942 at 948, ""in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking: 'I suspect but I cannot prove.' The facts which can reasonably ground a suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief, yet some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown. In Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266, a question was raised as to whether a payee had reason to suspect that the payer, a debtor, ""was unable to pay [its] debts as they became due"" as that phrase was used in s 95(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth). Kitto J said (at 303): 
A suspicion that something exists is more than a mere idle wondering whether it exists or not; it is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust, amounting to 'a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence', as Chambers' Dictionary expresses it. Consequently, a reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence. The notion which 'reason to suspect' expresses in sub-s (4) is, I think, of something which in all the circumstances would create in the mind of a reasonable person in the position of the payee an actual apprehension or fear that the situation of the payer is in actual fact that which the sub-section describes - a mistrust of the payer's ability to pay his debts as they become due and of the effect which acceptance of the payment would have as between the payee and the other creditors.
The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture. 
31I have set out, in paragraphs (7) to (17) above, those matters relating to the loan application and purchase of the Mortdale property which are disclosed by the evidence.  Mr Jones did not argue against the proposition that such matters were, in fact, disclosed.  Bearing in mind the observations in George v Rockett to which I have referred above, I am of the view that those matters are more than sufficient to induce, in any reasonable person, the suspicion held by Mr Spark.      
32I do not accept the submission advanced by Mr Jones that on the facts of the present case, it is necessary for the Commission to establish a nexus between the making of the false or misleading statement in the application, and the advancement of the money by Gladiator. In my view, there is nothing in the terms of s. 178BB of the Crimes Act which supports the conclusion that any such nexus is required.   
33In particular, the decision in R v Ho and Szeto (supra) relied upon by Mr Jones provides no support for his submission and is clearly distinguishable from the present case.  That decision was concerned with the provisions of s 178BA which are cast in terms which are quite different from those in s. 178BB.  Whilst the decision is authority for the proposition that, for the purposes of an offence under s 178BA, there must be a causal connection between the deception of which that section speaks and the obtaining of the money, it has nothing to say about the provisions of s 178BB which, as I have said, are cast in completely different terms. 
Has the defendant's interest in the Mortdale property ceased to become serious crime derived property pursuant to s. 9(5)(a)?34Accepting that the defendant did not sign the application, and further accepting that she has committed no offence, there is evidence pointing to those matters set out in paragraphs (7) to (17) above.    There is also an available inference that the defendant must have executed the Memorandum of Transfer of the Mortdale property at or about the time of settlement of the purchase, in order to become the registered proprietor.
35In my view, these matters are sufficient to have aroused a reasonable suspicion of the kind contemplated by s 9(5)(a), namely that the defendant's interest in the Mortdale property was, at the time of its acquisition, serious crime derived property.  Without determining the question of who might bear any onus of proof in terms of the matters set out in s. 9(5)(a), it is relevant for me to take into account that the defendant's affidavit is largely silent on the matters which, in my view, were sufficient to have aroused the relevant suspicion.    
Conclusion 36In my view, for the foregoing reasons, the orders sought by the Commission in its notice of motion should be granted.  
37The question of whether such orders should be made on the terms sought by Mr Jones remains outstanding.  That may be a matter in respect of which the parties are able to reach agreement.  There will also be a necessity for an order to be made vacating those orders which are presently in force and which were made on 25 March 2011.
38In these circumstances, I make the following orders:
(a)I stand the matter over for further directions until 9.30 am on 23 April 2012 before me;
(b)I direct the parties to bring in Short Minutes of Orders reflecting the conclusions I have reached and which are set out in this judgment.

Introduction

1The plaintiff brings proceedings for damages arising out of an injury she suffered on 5 October 2009, when she was attacked by the defendant's horse, ""Wrangler"", while riding with the defendant on her property in Sackville Road, Ebenezer.

2The circumstances of the plaintiff's injury were as follows. The plaintiff and defendant both have a long history of involvement with, and ownership of, horses, although the plaintiff portrays herself as somewhat naïve and reliant upon the advice of the defendant. The plaintiff and defendant met the year before the accident, and had been living together on the plaintiff's property for approximately eight months, although for the last four months of their relationship the defendant lived on a property nearby because of his work duties. He returned to the plaintiff's home on weekends, when they would go for rides on her property, in the ""arena"" paddock at the far end of the acreage. The plaintiff owned about a dozen horses, and the defendant's stallion, Wrangler, was also stabled at the plaintiff's property.

3For some months prior to the accident, the plaintiff had agisted two of her mares on a neighbouring property. About seven days before the accident, the plaintiff brought these two horses (named ""Aletist"" and ""Butterfly"") back from agistment, and put them in the paddock containing the arena where she and the defendant regularly rode. As she was doing so, she noticed, according to her evidence, that one of the horses, Aletist, was in season and ""winking"" (releasing fluid which would signal her condition to stallions). The defendant, who was living away from the premises during this week, was not a party to the bringing back of these horses, but the plaintiff contends that he would have seen these mares, as he returned to the property daily for the purpose of filling the food bins for the horses in their paddocks around the plaintiff's property.

4The accident occurred as follows. When the plaintiff and defendant, mounted on their respective horses, Freckles and Wrangler, reached the path leading to the arena paddock, Wrangler became excited at seeing the two mares, Aletist and Butterfly behind the fence in their paddock. The defendant attempted to turn Wrangler to go back to the homestead. At first Wrangler obeyed, but then he reared up and the defendant was thrown to the ground. The defendant got up and shouted instructions to the plaintiff (the circumstances of this conversation and the precise location of the parties are in dispute). The horse Wrangler immediately charged back towards Aletist, turned right, galloped to where the plaintiff was and bit her left leg above the knee. The plaintiff came out of the saddle and was thrown to the ground. She was seriously injured. She had to drag herself to the fence to get out of the way of Wrangler while the defendant went to call the ambulance.

The issues in these proceedings

5In written submissions, and in oral submissions on 3 April 2012, the parties confirmed that the plaintiff's case is one of actual knowledge on the part of the defendant that the horse Aletist was in season, and not that the defendant ought to have known that it was dangerous to ride towards or into a paddock containing one or more mares which may have been in season.

6The issues for determination are as follows:

(a)Whether the defendant owed any duty of care to the plaintiff to warn her not to ride her horse ""Freckles"" towards or into the arena paddock on her own property because another horse owned by the plaintiff, ""Aletist"", was in season;

(b)Whether the duty of care owed by the defendant was breached;

(c)Whether the particulars of negligence pleaded have been made out;

(d)Section 5D Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and issues of causation;

(e)Whether, by reason of s 5L Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), the defendant was not liable in negligence for the harm suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff;

(f)Whether there was voluntary assumption of the risk (pleaded in the defence as a volenti defence at common law, and thereby the subject of challenge by the plaintiff, as the defence does not refer to s 5G Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW));

(g)The asserted effect of admissions by the defendant and s 69 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW);

(h)Contributory negligence (ss 5R and 5S Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)); and

(i)Quantum of damages.

The particulars of negligence pleaded

7The plaintiff alleges that the defendant is a horse expert and that as the horse riding companion of the plaintiff (paragraph 1, statement of claim), he owed her a duty of care. It is asserted that he breached that duty of care as follows:

(a)Failing to properly and/or adequately control his horse Wrangler.

(b)Allowing the plaintiff to ride her horse in the vicinity of Wrangler when it was not safe to do so.

(c)Allowing his horse Wrangler to be close to the horse Aletist when he knew that Aletist was in season.

(d)Allowing the plaintiff and her horse to ride together with Wrangler when he knew or should have known that Wrangler was ""fresh"" and had been fed grain recently so that Wrangler was ""pepped up"".

(e)Instructing the plaintiff ""don't let him get past"" after Wrangler had thrown him to the ground when it was not safe for the plaintiff to get near to Wrangler.

(f)Failing to direct the plaintiff to immediately leave the area after Wrangler started to become excited.

(g)Failing to direct the plaintiff to immediately leave the area after Wrangler had thrown the defendant to the ground.

(h)Failing to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff.

(i)Approaching, or continuing to approach, Aletist, knowing that Wrangler had previously become excited/agitated in the presence of other horses and in particular mares.

8The plaintiff, who was taken by helicopter to Westmead Hospital and in the intensive care unit for a week, remained in hospital for three weeks, having suffered severe injuries to her left leg, left wrist and right shoulder. The nature and severity of those injuries are essentially not matters of contest, although the non-economic and future economic loss are disputed.

The procedural history of the claim

9On 1 June 2011, the hearing of these proceedings was vacated, with the costs of the adjournment reserved to the trial judge, by reason of the plaintiff's amendment to her claim to include particular (i), namely the assertion that the defendant knew that the horse had a bad disposition and had previously become excited or agitated in the presence of other horses and in particular in the presence of mares.

10An application to amend the statement of claim during the trial, to plead that if the defendant did not know the mare Aletist was in season, he ought to have known of the potential danger, was withdrawn.

11I shall first set out the evidence of the plaintiff and defendant and their respective witnesses.

The plaintiff's evidence

12The plaintiff, who was born in June 1966 and is currently 45 years of age, completed a Bachelor of Applied Science at Hawkesbury Agriculture College and then completed training at the Police Academy at Goulburn. She spent some time at Norwest Legal Services as well as completing general duties at police stations in the country. She has worked as an investigator at the NSW Ombudsman's Office, Railcorp and more recently for a government department.

13The plaintiff bought a 25 acre property at Ebenezer in 2005. She kept about a dozen horses she owned on this property. It was as a result of her horse riding activities that she met the defendant in 2008. She described this meeting as follows:

""When I had - I returned back to the academy I had taken some horses with me and one of the horses that I'd taken was a young horse that I had wanted to continue working with because I'd been having lessons from a local fellow prior to going down to Goulburn and I wanted to keep that up. And he was quite a spirited and afraid horse and I had contacted the proprietor of the steel company that had done the modification on the float and I'd asked him or he'd recommended to me Allan again as a horse expert and at that particular time when I spoke to the proprietor he had been or was having one of his horses trained by Allan and he spoke very highly of the work that Allan had done with the horse and that's how I came to be put on to Allan."" (T 14-15)

14The plaintiff described her own horse knowledge and background at the time she met the defendant:

""Q. What happened after your discussion?
A. I told him what my background and experience was and I said to him I'm an English rider. I had dressage lessons when I was a much younger person. A couple of years ago I purchased an old quarter horse gelding who was an old rodeo horse and that horse was teaching me. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know much about how to ride a western horse and the horse that I was hoping he would help me with was a young - and I was saying this, was a young quarter horse gelding who had had some reining training prior to me purchasing him and I explained that to me the horse was quite afraid and quite fast and had training in working at speed and being manoeuvrable and during the conversation just prior to that I'd asked Allan when he had explained what the John Lyons Select Training was I'd asked him what sort of training do you do and he told me that he could train anything and that he'd trained national champions and he was a reining trainer and he'd also trained police horses in the states."" (T 16)

15The plaintiff compared her knowledge to the defendant's knowledge of horses as follows:

""Q. How would you compare your knowledge of horses with Mr Meyer's knowledge?
A. Very little. He was highly experienced from what I could see. He was successful with the time that he worked on that horse. The more I saw of what he was doing with the horse the more I realised I didn't know."" (T 17)

16Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Jones, indicated (T 17) that although there was no payment of money for these training activities, there would be evidence about reliance upon the defendant's expertise (T 17 line 27; T 18 lines 5-7). She said that the defendant gave her lessons (T 19-21). 

17The plaintiff commenced to have a personal relationship with the defendant, and in December 2008, approximately eight months before the events the subject of this litigation, he moved into her property. 

18The plaintiff painted a picture of the defendant as essentially remaining at home and performing the farm duties, as well as going for lengthy rides on his horse (T 19), while she worked full time. In fact the defendant worked even longer hours (see [24] below). 

19The evidence of the extent of the plaintiff's expertise was the subject of challenge in cross-examination. Although the plaintiff had painted a picture of the lessons she received from the defendant as being beginner's lessons, she had been riding, including riding in competitions, since about the age of 12 (T 83), winning ribbons in gymkhanas. She competed in events called ""barrel racing"" around New South Wales (T 85-86). She worked as a trail guide, supervising groups of people on horsebacks (T 243) for inexperienced rider on country riding holidays. She refused to describe herself as an experienced rider (T 86), although she had a part time job at ""Horselands"" (T 86), a shop which supplied horse care products, and had bought the property in 2005 so that she could stable all her horses. Those horses included a stallion which she bred with a mare, although she said that she was unsuccessful, as this stallion was injured in the process (T 87-88).

20The plaintiff described (T 16) how the defendant trained her horse. She did not pay him for this (T 17 line 13). She said that after the defendant moved in ""I had asked him if he would give me lessons"" (T 19) on Freckles in western riding. This was because the plaintiff was accustomed to English riding (T 20). She said that the defendant agreed to do so and that when they went to the arena paddock ""he would give me some instruction on [Freckles]"" (T 20) in western riding. The plaintiff decided to sell some horses and advertise these horses for sale in July 2009 (T 20). It was in relation to this sale transaction that she wanted to have western riding lessons. She said that the defendant also gave her advice about appropriate saddles and equipment, and that she took ""huge notice"" (T 21) of what he told her. She said that when they went to the arena paddock the defendant would give her lessons, usually in the ""round pen"".

21The plaintiff said she was not an experienced horsewoman and knew little about stallions:

""Q. So Ms Watson, during the period leading up to the date of your injury I want to suggest to you that you were an experienced horse woman, quite capable of managing multiple horses including a stallion on your own?
A. I disagree entirely.

Q. So are you presenting yourself to the court and is it your suggestion that you are an inexperienced person incapable of managing horses?
A. To some extent that's true.

Q. To some extent?
A. The - the horses on my place that I felt comfortable about managing were Freckles [sic]. Like I said to you that stallion was an entirely different proposition and in fact when Allan moved in he'd offered to assist me with different horses on the place because he suggested that I had too many and I certainly agreed with him and the stallion was one of the horses that he handled on the property.

Q. But before Mr Meyer moved into the property you had that stallion for a period of what would appear to be in excess of 12 months?
A. And did nothing with him.

Q. Except attempt to breed with him and take him to the vets on your own?
A. And when the farrier came to trim those feet the farrier held him, not me, and the horse used to misbehave quite drastically for the farrier.

Q. Ms Watson, I'm suggesting to you that you are an experienced handler of horses with a great deal of knowledge in relation to horses. That you are an experienced rider. That you have the capabilities of managing horses including stallions?
A. I don't mean to be rude but I'm not sure what part of that you would like me to address."" (T 88-89)

22The plaintiff agreed (T 90) that she was not so frightened of Wrangler that she told the defendant not to bring him onto the property. She agreed that she had control of the property and she had control of what occurred on it, including what horses came onto the property (T 90) and what paddock they were put in. On occasions she had fed Wrangler but said that he had been ""nippy with me"" (T 91). The defendant subsequently told her to keep away from him and said that he had banned his former wife, Ms Fenner, from any contact with Wrangler (Ms Fenner did not give this evidence when called by the plaintiff).

23After the defendant moved into the property, the plaintiff went riding with him, to her arena paddock or to the back of the property, about every second weekend (T 91). She said that they had never ridden through the arena paddock with a horse in it before, although there were mares in other paddocks on the property during this 10 month period, including the mare Aletist (T 91). She said that these horses never came into close proximity with Wrangler because the arena paddock, the place to which they rode, was not used for this purpose.

24For the first six months that the defendant lived on the property, he was working as a long distance driver for up to seven days a week. The long hours that he was away meant that he spent little time at the property, so in mid-2009 he obtained a job in a nearby stud (T 25). This stud was about 10-15 minutes drive away, but as mares generally foal at night, he had to live on the stud property. He returned on some weekends. The plaintiff and defendant both gave evidence they would talk to each other on the telephone on a daily basis and that in addition, the defendant would come onto the plaintiff's property one to two times a day to put feed in the horse feed bins (T 25).

25There were about 12 horses located on the plaintiff's property in 2009, although two of the plaintiff's horses, Aletist and Butterfly, were agisted for some months on a neighbouring property. The plaintiff was the sole person responsible for the placement of horses on her property. The defendant was not cross-examined about a statement he made (T 344) that she rotated horses between paddocks from time to time at her discretion.

26According to the plaintiff, when she was bringing back her two mares from agistment to her property, about a week before her accident, she observed one of the mares, Aletist, to be ""winking"", a term which describes fluid coming out of a mare's twitching vulva, indicating she is fertile and receptive to a male (T 25). Evidence from the experts as well as from the lay witnesses was to the effect that mares are in season about once a month for a period of up to a week, and that they are particularly likely to be in season during spring. Although the tradition of giving all horses birth dates in the same month is for convenience purposes, this reflects the fact that many horses are fertile in the September-October period.

The plaintiff's account of conversations with the defendant about Aletist being in season

27According to the plaintiff, when she spoke to the defendant on the telephone on the day she brought the horses home, their conversation was as follows:

""Q. What sort of contact did you have with Mr Meyer whilst he was at the stud?
A. We used to speak daily. Our practise had been of an afternoon or evening that we would chat to one another on the phone to see what had happened with each of us during the day. And he was also spending a lot of time at my place as well when he had time available from work. And on the afternoon that I'd brought Aletist and Butterfly home, which was just getting towards dark, I'd called him that evening and part of our conversation, because I had told him that I'd brought--

Q. What did you say to him?
A. I said to him ""I brought Aletist and Butterfly home today. Aletist is in season, just so you know. I've put them at the far paddock at the back of the property, the farthest away from Wrangler. Is that okay"".

Q. Did he respond?
A. He did. And he said to me ""That's fine"". He also said ""You shouldn't have done that because I was going to help you"" and that was reference to me actually bringing the horses home.

Q. Besides speaking with him on the phone, what other contact did Mr Meyer have at that stage with you and your property and the horses on your property whilst he was in the position at Don Burke's stud farm?
A. He had a lot. As I said, we would talk on a daily basis. He was also spending a lot of time at my place. He'd told me that at the stud he'd had a lunch break and also that he was, part of his duties was that he had to feed some of the stud's horses that were kept on a different property and that he would arrange to feed those horses either during his lunch break and then come past my place at that time, or alternatively do it in the afternoon so he would leave the stud and go and feed those horses and then come back past my place."" (T 25-26)

28Although the defendant came to the property for about half an hour early in the morning and again in the evening for the purpose of putting feed in the horses' feed bins (which would have included the horses Aletist and Butterfly, now that they had been relocated in the arena paddock), he did not see the plaintiff again until next Saturday (5 October, the date of the accident). They continued to have daily conversations, but this topic was not mentioned again.

29On Saturday 5 October, the plaintiff and defendant first went to Kurrajong to meet the plaintiff's mother for breakfast (T 22). There was discussion about going for a ride later in the day. They returned to the plaintiff's home in Ebenezer, and at about 2.00pm they both decided to saddle up the horses and travel to the arena paddock (T 22-23). It was their habit to ride their own horses, Wrangler and Freckles. According to the plaintiff, the following conversation occurred:

""Q. What was said?
A. When I had finished getting Freckles ready, I'd led Freckles off the wash bay and I was standing just below - we were both standing just below where the water tank is and a little garden area.

Q. The water tank, is that the one shown on the right?
A. That's correct.

Q. Of Exhibit D1?
A. That's correct.

Q. What was said?
A. I said to Allan ""Will Wrangles be okay with Aletist up there, she's in season don't forget"".

Q. Did he respond to you?
A. Yes he did.

Q. What did he say?
A. He said ""He should be fine"".
Q. Did you have any further discussion with him?
A. There was. I said to him ""The mares could always go into that spare paddock before we go up if you like"". 

Q. The spare paddock being what paddock?
A. It was the paddock that was adjacent to the area and on the first map it's on the left-hand side of Aletist's paddock.

Q. I think you have told us this but just in case you haven't, to go into the arena which is I think where you were destined that day, is that right--
A. That's correct.

Q. --you had to go through the paddock in which Aletist and Butterfly were located, is that right?
A. That's correct.

Q. After you said to Mr Meyer ""Well you can always put the two mares in the spare paddock"", did he respond to that?
A. He did. He said ""No it'll be fine""."" (T 26-27)

30The plaintiff was certain that she had informed the defendant twice of these events, although she said she was unaware of the dangers of taking a stallion into a paddock containing a mare in season (T 186 line 28-35) and although she had no regular practice of monitoring when the horses on her property were in season:

""Q. Did you have any monitoring of or make any observations about her, for example, past behaviour of winking and things like that?
A. Sorry--

Q. Did you take any specific notice over that period of two years about her behaviour in the period when she was seasonal, for example winking behaviour?
A. I would have noticed it but I don't know that I made any specific note to myself in relation to that.

Q. Are you able to say whether she showed any obvious visible signs of being in season?
A. Aw well, she would wink when she was in season.

Q. And did you notice for how long that occurred for?
A. I can't answer that at this point. I'm aware that the season lasts about a week give or take depending on - apparently horses are all different, but I don't have any - what am I trying to say, I hadn't made any particular observations in terms of her patterns of behaviour if you like in relation to when she was in season other than if she was I would see it.

Q. Would her season go only for two or three days where she was exhibiting signs of winking?
A. I'm not sure that my - well I may well have made observations along those lines, I don't recall them now. Yep, sorry, I'm not sure what else I can say.

Q. In relation to a mare being in season are you at the present moment aware of the seriousness in relation to keeping a mare away from a stallion during that period of time?
A. I certainly am today.

Q. What about back in 2009?
A. I was aware that mares who are in season were in season for a reason, if you like, that they were - had times when they were receptive to a stallion and that was the times when they were actually in their season.

Q. So were you aware of the need to keep, and this is again going back to the time of your injury in October 2009, were you aware of the need or the caution not to put a stallion near a mare who was in season?
A. Yes.

Q. You were aware of that?
A. Well, and that's why I had advised Allan where I had put the horses and noted to him that they were the farthest away from his stallion and up the back of the property.

Q. When you went riding with Mr Meyer that day it was your plan to go down, that was your intention to go down into the paddock which was where the arena was located, is that right?
A. We were both going there.

Q. And you're aware at that time that it wasn't advisable to go into a paddock where there was a mare on season?
A. Are you talking - sorry I don't understand the question.

Q. Well as at 5 October 2009 when you were injured, were you aware of the dangers associated with taking a stallion into a paddock where there was a mare which was in season?
A. No.

Q. You weren't aware of that at all?
A. On that day when I advised Allan again that the mare was in season, yes I did have some concern in relation to the behaviour of his stallion which is why I reminded him and asked him if his horse was going to be okay. I have not experience in terms of people riding with stallions in paddocks with mares in season.

Q. See Ms Watson, you never told Mr Meyer either on the telephone or even before the ride, that Aletist was in season?
A. I absolutely told him on each occasion.

Q. Are you suggesting the reason you told him was that you were aware of the dangers associated with riding a stallion into a paddock or even in the vicinity of a mare?
A. I told him because his - sorry his horse is a stallion, the mares were up there and I'm reminding him this is where we're going is your horse going to be okay, because I didn't know how his horse would respond, hence my question to him in terms of will he be okay."" (T 185-186)

31The plaintiff repeated (T 187 line 14) that she was not aware of there being any danger. She said the second conversation was simply ""a courtesy"" to him in case he had forgotten what she said in the phone call some seven days earlier (T 187).

32In cross-examination it was put to the plaintiff (T 188-189) that she had not told the defendant that Aletist was in season. She denied this.

33As the plaintiff and defendant set out on 5 October, she said the defendant told her Wrangler was ""a bit fresh"" because he had been given ""a fair bit of grain"" and not much exercise (T 229). 

The circumstances of the accident

34The plaintiff described the accident as follows. The plaintiff and defendant proceeded from the stable where they had saddled the horses and began to ride their horses up the track. They were heading towards the arena paddock. The plaintiff said that Wrangler appeared fresh, and was zigzagging. 

35The plaintiff and defendant reached the paddock previously occupied by Freckles. This paddock was empty of horses on the day (T 30). The defendant was a short distance ahead (about 10-15 metres) and they were riding towards the end of the track where the arena was. Before that, it was necessary to go through the gated or cordoned-off area of the paddock occupied by Aletist and Butterfly. 

36When they were approximately 20-25 metres from the gate, Aletist and Butterfly could be seen. The plaintiff said that Aletist was facing backwards and it was obvious from her rear end that she was ""winking"". The defendant denied this.

37Wrangler began to play up (T 40-41) by tossing his head, dipping his head down and beginning to prance. The defendant was gripping the reins and would go forward with the movement of the horse. The horse then began screaming. The plaintiff said ""I think we better go back"", to which the defendant agreed, saying he was already trying to get the horse away from the fence. The plaintiff turned her horse around and began to walk very slowly back towards the home. She was looking back to see how the defendant was going on his horse and observed that the horse was moving sideways. He was at about a 45-degree angle to the right hand side fence line, which was the electrified fence line. 

38As the plaintiff was leading up to the hay shed, Wrangler appeared to be a bit calmer. The defendant got Wrangler to a gate area on the right hand side of the track when the horse changed direction and went to the left hand side of the fence. He threw his head down and threw the defendant, who went sailing over the horse's neck and on the horse's right hand side (T 44). The defendant hit the ground near the trunk of a small tree; at this stage the plaintiff was about 10 or 15 metres back (T 45). The horse Wrangler spun around and began charging back towards the two mares Aletist and Butterfly. The plaintiff said that the defendant called out ""Don't let him get past"" (T 45). 

39The plaintiff had already stopped Freckles from going forward. She was sitting on her horse beside the hay shed, facing towards the gateway where Freckles was. This was the gateway where Wrangler had deviated to the left. Wrangler was charging back towards them as fast as he could. As the defendant had told the plaintiff not to let the horse go past, she squeezed Freckles with her heels and asked him to move forward and Freckles took one step forward with his right front foot. She thought she could grab a rein, but it never reached that point, because Wrangler had started to charge in her general direction. He lined her up and, coming at her very fast, took her leg above the knee. He ""latched onto her like a vice"". He continued to charge towards Aletist and Butterfly, holding onto her leg, and she began screaming (T 48). 

40The plaintiff had not changed her position in the saddle as she was dragged along. Wrangler did not break stride with Freckles, so they were galloping side by side (T 49), while Wrangler had the plaintiff's left knee in his mouth. The plaintiff then came out of the saddle and she was up side down with her head close to the ground. She hit the track when the horse dropped her and she landed on her back. 

41The plaintiff knew immediately that she was seriously injured. The defendant ran up to her and said ""I'm going to put Wrangles [sic] down"" (T 50) and went to the house to get assistance, as they did not have mobile phones. Wrangler charged back towards her and she had to crawl underneath the fence to avoid him (T 51-52).

42The plaintiff suffered serious injuries which are described in more detail in the section of this judgment in relation to quantum.

The defendant's evidence

43The defendant, who is currently 60 years of age, was born in the United States. He became interested in horses as a teenager and acquired his first horse in about 1972 or 1973. Since that time, he has owned about a dozen horses (T 323), a number comparable to that owned by the plaintiff. At one stage he worked with the Sheriff's Department in the United States as an instructor and trainer, but this was part-time. He worked for a trucking business between 1971 and 1999. 

44The defendant began working full time in the United States as a horse trainer for about three years after 1999. He completed the John Lyons horse training course in 2001 and it was during this six months at school that he met Ms Kate Fenner. He went to live with her in the United Kingdom in 2002, where he lived until 2004. He married Ms Fenner in 2004 and worked with her as a horse trainer, covering both western and English horse training and horse riding disciplines. He came to Australia in 2004 with Ms Fenner to live. They looked for a property and settled on a country property of about 100 acres in the area between Marulan and Goulburn. It had been divided into paddocks for horses as the previous owner has owned horses. He lived there until Ms Fenner said she wanted in a divorce, in late 2007 or early 2008. During this period of time both he and Ms Fenner trained horses. They owned about three or four horses between them over this time.

45The defendant and Ms Fenner returned to the United State for further training with John Lyons. While there he bought the horse Wrangler. Wrangler was about two years old at the time. The horse remained with the defendant when he returned from the United States to England and was then flown to Australia. Wrangler then remained with the defendant and Ms Fenner in England for about 18 months. (The defendant's dates in relation to these events are somewhat inconsistent (see T 328-330), but nothing turns on this part of the chronology.)

46The defendant had had prior experience with stallions. His first horse in 1972 was a colt. He said it made little difference to him whether the horse he was riding was a stallion or not (T 326). It was difficult for him to put a number on how many stallions he had managed, but he said that stallions were fewer in numbers than the rest of the horse population, because they were principally kept for breeding purposes rather than for riding.

47The defendant described Wrangler's behaviour in England and the circumstances in which he suffered an injury when thrown from Wrangler when the horse was injured by a nail in the saddle:

""Q. During the time that Wrangler was in England with you and Kate how did you find his behaviour as a horse?
A. Typical.

Q. And what do you mean by typical?
A. He was a young horse that had no education and that was the reason for buying him really, rather than having to change a behaviour you get to build it from scratch.

Q. In this building from scratch process in England did you have any problems with him?
A. I did. It wasn't his problem. While breaking him in Kate and I had a clinic to do on one weekend so I put him away on Friday night and had him looked after while we went and gave this instruction at this clinic and came back early the next week and started him again. And when I went to saddle him he acted differently. I knew there was something but it didn't stop me and I mounted and he began to buck and carried on more vigorously with each buck after that and I wound up falling and he came down on my ankle and shattered it.

Q. Was that behaviour of Wrangler the same or any different to any other experiences you'd had with stallions during the course of your time with working with stallions?
A. I don't think it had anything to do with him being a stallion. This was all brought about by a nail that was making its way from the inside of the saddle, or the underside of the saddle towards the horse and my weight in the saddle was simply driving that nail into his back."" (T 331)

48The defendant described Wrangler's behaviour in Australia as uneventful:

""Q. When you migrated with Kate to Australia did you bring Wrangler with you?
A. We did.

Q. Where did Wrangler come and reside or be housed at Tiyces Lane?
A. That's correct.

Q. Did he remain at the property at Tiyces Lane during the course of the time that you resided there?
A. Yes he did.

Q. During that period of time was there any - were there other horses on Tiyces Lane?
A. Absolutely.

Q. Did Wrangler have any involvement with those other horses?
A. Involvement in--

Q. Did he mix with them?
A. He wasn't housed with them. You never put a stallion along a common fence with any other horse. But he rode with Kate while Kate rode geldings and mares and everything else.

Q. And how did you find Wrangler's behaviour with other horses during that period of time?
A. A non event.

Q. What do you mean by a non event?
A. He was focussed on the instructions, and on me, and what we were trying to accomplish at the time.

Q. During that period of time how much involvement did you have with Wrangler, was it on a day to day basis during that period of time that you lived at Tiyces Lane?
A. It was every day..

Q. What were your observations about his behaviour during that period of time?
A. Can you re-phrase that, I'm not sure--

Q. Well did you form any opinion about his behaviour, or his demeanour, during that period of time?
A. He was a typical horse."" (T 331-332)

49During the time that the defendant and Ms Fenner lived together, three incidents occurred which are relied upon by the plaintiff as evidence of the horse Wrangler as having a bad disposition. These are described in more detail in the section below concerning the temperament of the horse Wrangler.

50After the defendant left the matrimonial home he had been sharing with Ms Fenner, he met the plaintiff, while he was working at Australian Stockyards. This was a steel fabricating company which, among other things, built horse floats. He was working there as a welder. He was consulted because the plaintiff said she was ""afraid"" of a horse she had bought (T 338). They became romantically involved. The plaintiff invited him to come and live with her at the property in Ebenezer some months earlier to December 2007 but he said he would not do so until he had obtained employment. He then went back to driving trucks, and in particular driving racehorse trucks for Prestige and its sister company Hawkesbury Racehorse Transport (T 339). He worked for them driving long-range trucks but was still home every night. However, as horseracing was a seven-day a week job, he was on call every day of the week, including many weekends. The defendant found the very long hours driving trucks to be tiring and began looking for other employment. He worked for Prestige/Hawkesbury Racehorse Transport from January to June 2009. He found employment at Burke stud in June and worked for them until about October 2009. He lived at the stud but came home for about three weekends out of four.

51The defendant gave a very different description of the rides he had with the plaintiff. He said that he always rode Wrangler, and that the plaintiff would more often than not ride Freckles. He said that they both ""loved to ride"" (T 348) and that these were rides for pleasure. He said his level of horsemanship was different to the plaintiff's, and said:

""A. I believe Lorna has ridden for almost as many years as I have and certainly done eventing that I've never done and I think it takes a great deal more experience to go out and do eventing which is running and jumping through hazards and fences, I'm not up to that."" (T 381)

52He said that he did not advise her on selection of horses, and that he did not provide input into selection of horses when she advertised some horses in a horse swap (T 381). He said that he had given her instructions in western riding but that he stopped giving her instructions on western riding because ""all it did was lead to an argument"" (T 382).

53During the six-month period that he was working for the transport company, he would try to go for a ride with the plaintiff at least once a week. He described these rides as follows:

""Q. When you'd go for a ride whereabouts would you go riding on the property?
A. We might keep the ride to the arena, we might go to the arena and then make our way to the bush area that was you know towards the back of the property beyond the arena or we might do both of those and then ride out onto the road and then go down the road and there was a little track that Lorna knew, it kind of went to the back of her place, so wherever we wanted to go.

Q. And what horse would you ride on those ride?
A. I always rode Wrangler.

Q. And what horse would Lorna ride?
A. More often than not she would ride Freckles, if not all the time.

Q. And during that period of time did you experience any difficulties with Wrangler whilst riding with Lorna whilst you were riding Wrangler and she was riding Freckles?
A. No.

Q. And again I'm just asking during that first six months, during that period of time are you aware of where Aelitist was housed on the property Ebenezer?
A. There were quite a number of horses and they were rotated between paddocks from time to time at Lorna's discretion. I was made aware of what horses were where so that I could feed them the proper ration but none of that was within my control or - so I just delivered the feeds where Lorna told me the horses were."" (T 343-344)

54Wrangler and another horse owned by the defendant also lived on the property. The defendant said that there were many times that he rode Wrangler in the arena paddock. On occasions, they rode in the arena while there were horses in the arena paddock, but they did not go into the arena paddock and ride at the back of the paddock, where these horses were kept. They rode in the arena (at T 345). 

55The defendant's jobs while living on the property included feeding the horses. He described this as follows:

""Q. Can you give an indication to the court what feeding of the horses involved?
A. Lorna would generally and certainly in the beginning, make up her rations for her horses, in the buckets with their individual names on them so that I could deliver the proper ration to the proper horse and that was simply my job until I became more familiar with both her horses and her feeding regime and she would have that on a piece of paper for me, who got what and she entrusted me after some time to give them the proper feed.

Q. And during the time when you were feeding the horses, how did you physically do that, did you move the feed from the shed around to the different paddocks?
A. Yes by means of a wagon or trolley that Lorna had.

Q. And would you pull that physically just on foot or would you have that on a car or the back of the horse?
A. No I just dragged the thing.

Q. Sorry?
A. I would just drag it along behind me."" (T 345)

56It was necessary for the plaintiff to remain on the Burke stud during the week because he had to assist with foaling (T 346-347). He would have one weekend off in four. As there were four staff members, they would share the weekends off between them. He nevertheless had weekends free during the day, and would still go for weekend rides with the plaintiff. He also continued to be responsible for the feeding of her horses:

""A. I would generally feed in the morning and feed at night so that meant getting up, running over to Lorna's place, feed, run back, feed the sixty some horses there before starting the day to train and then in the evening I would do the same routine.

Q. And did it involve, the feeding regime that you performed at the, whilst you were working at the Burke Stud, was the same regime you just described a moment ago is that correct, in relation to the feeding of the horses at Ebenezer was it the same regime that you described a moment ago, how the mixing of the having to feed--?
A. Yes, Lorna would try and make up a week at a time so there would be stacks of buckets that belonged to a particular horse and all I'd have to do is come along take the top one of each of the stacks, throw them in the trolley and down the lane I'd go.

Q. And the feeding that you undertook whilst you worked at the Burke Stud, when you undertook it at Ebenezer was that undertaken in daylight hours or in darkness?
A. That would depend, generally in the mornings it was dark, given the time of the year and the fact that I needed to be back at the stud to start work there at seven, seven-thirty in the morning so, and then I had to do Lorna's even earlier, I would get to feeding in the evening when I could.

Q. And would that generally be in the hours of darkness or in light?
A. It wasn't pitch dark by any stretch of the imagination but it wasn't full light either.""(T 347)

57While the plaintiff said that she only went riding with the defendant about every second weekend, the defendant's evidence was that they would go riding at ""every opportunity"", and that while that depended on the plaintiff's work schedule ""we both loved to ride and that's what we'd do"" (T 348). This appears to be a more likely description of their activities together. 

58The defendant's presence on the property for feeding would take about half an hour in the morning and half an hour at night, and in addition, he would be there on weekends all day and often overnight (T 348). He was asked whether the horses would always be at the feeding trough:

""Q. And in relation to when the horses would be fed, was it always the practice that the horses would be there at the feeding trough when you fed them?
A. No, no it wasn't those horses had a little more to choose from in that back country and they, as often as not weren't there when you'd dump the feed in."" (T 348)

59He said (at T 390) that, at best, horses would come to the troughs at feeding time about 50% of the time, but that you could not see if a mare was ""winking"" unless you saw the horse from behind (T 391).

60He was asked in particular about his observation of the horse Aletist and the other horses in the arena paddock in the week before the accident:

""Q. I just want to clarify the question, when I said the horses, I was referring to Aletist and the other horse in the arena paddock which is what, you answered that question didn't you?
A. Yes I did.

Q. Do you know what other horse was there with Aelitist [sic]?
A. No I know there was another horse, I don't remember that horse's name.

Q. And did you observe Aelitist during that period of time of the week when she was in the paddock the arena paddock?
A. Did I observe her.

Q. Yes?
A. Not particularly.

Q. Did you observe any characteristics such as what has been described as winking during that period of time which would indicate to you that she was in season?
A. No I did not.

Q. The plaintiff has given evidence in relation to a conversation that took place on the telephone relating to - whereby the plaintiff said that she told you that Aelitist was in season, this was on the telephone during the week, did any such conversation take place?
A. Absolutely not."" (T 348-349)

61The defendant agreed that they would have telephone conversations on a daily basis, sometimes several times a day, and that they would discuss matters such as horses. He said the plaintiff described such matters as changes to feeding regimes or water troughs, whether the garden needed to be watered and the like. It was not necessary for the defendant to open the gate for deliveries because those persons had a key (T 349), that there were occasions when he had to let persons in to the property.

62He said that Wrangler was a typical stallion and stallions ""typically are nippy"" (T 350). He agreed it was very likely that he had told the plaintiff words to this effect (T 350).

The defendant's denials of conversations with the plaintiff about Aletist being in season

63The plaintiff alleges that she spoke to the defendant by telephone at the stud on the day that she brought the horses home from agistment. During this conversation the plaintiff says she told the defendant that Aletist was in season. The plaintiff says she had a second conversation with the defendant to this effect on the day of the accident. 

64The defendant said, in examination-in-chief:

""Q. The plaintiff has given evidence in relation to a conversation that took place on the telephone relating to - whereby the plaintiff said that she told you that Aelitist was in season, this was on the telephone during the week, did any such conversation take place?
A. Absolutely not.

Q. Was there any conversation of a telephone nature that took place during the time that you worked at all during, sorry I withdraw that question. Did you communicate with the plaintiff when you stayed overnight at the Burke Stud?
A. Yes daily, several times a day.

Q. And would you talk to the plaintiff about matters involving the horses?
A. Certainly.

Q. And would you talk to - and sorry what sort of things would you talk to the plaintiff about as far as the horses on Ebenezer was concerned?
A. Well if Lorna felt on horse needed more hay or less hay or had changed the feeding regime or water troughs had to be filled, garden needed to be watered it would be mentioned."" (T 349)

65The defendant denied that anything was said by the plaintiff about Aletist being in season on the day of the accident:

""Q. And was there anything said by the plaintiff about Aelitist being in season?
A. No.

Q. If something had been said by the plaintiff about Aelitist being in season would you have ridden Wrangler down to the area where Aelitist was situated?
A. Absolutely not.

Q. And why not?
A. My job at Burke Stud was to handle the stallions for collection, in so doing and in many years of experience prior to that one becomes aware of what a horse is capable of from a physical and emotional standpoint when it becomes aroused, it's dangerous and under the best of circumstances is hazardous and you just simply wouldn't do it."" (T 350)

66In cross-examination, the defendant denied being told, in either conversation:

""Q. Can I suggest to you that a conversation occurred during one of these daily conversations between you and Lorna Watson do you agree with that?
A. Quite likely yes.

Q. And can I suggest to you that at the same time she told you that Aelitist was in season, that happened didn't it?
A. No it did not.

Q. And can I suggest to you, you said to here ""that's fine"", do you agree with that?
A. No."" (T 387)

67This was put to the defendant a second time:

""Q. I want to suggest to you that not only did Lorna tell you over the telephone some days beforehand that she'd put the horses in there and Aelitist was in season, but she also told you on that very day just as you were about to set off riding, that's right isn't it?
A. No it isn't."" (T 393)

68Mr Jones went on to ask:

""Q. Just before you set out did you have a conversation in which she reminded you that the two mares were there?
A. No.

Q. Yes or no, okay?
A. I was feeding them, why would she remind me of that?

Q. Well she also said to you not to forget that Aelitist was in season?
A. No, absolutely not.

Q. And can I suggest to you that she said the mares could always go in the spare paddock before we go up, if you like. That's what she said to you wasn't it?
A. No.

Q. And you said ""No it'll be fine"" didn't you?
A. No I did not."" (T 393)

69The defendant said that it should have been obvious to the plaintiff, if she knew, as it was obviously potentially dangerous:

""Q. That's something she should have told you at the time?
A. If she knew.

Q. Yes?
A. Sure.

Q. Because it was something - I withdraw that. It should have been obvious to her that if you were to go through that paddock to get to the arena it may well have been dangerous if you were on Wrangler and one of the mares was in season?
A. So what's the question?

Q. That's because it should have been obvious to her that if you were to go through that paddock with one of the mares in season it may well be dangerous?
A. I think that was obvious to everyone.

Q. Even someone with a lot less knowledge and experience than Lorna?
A. I would say yes.

Q. Well can I suggest to you that the communication one of those mares was in season was indeed so obvious that she told you, do you agree with that?
A. No."" (T 395)

70In order to feed the horses, the defendant drove to her property very early in the morning before starting work and again in the evening after finishing. He would wheel the food (which the plaintiff had left out for him) along the track to the feed bins along the trail road, dump the food in and then leave immediately to return to the stud where he lived. He said that unless the horse showed its rear to him, he could not have observed ""winking"", and that horses did come to the food trough as he approached, but less than 50% of the time.

The circumstances leading to the accident

71On the day in question, the plaintiff and defendant made preparations for their usual ride. The defendant was adamant, both in examination in chief (T 350) and cross-examination, that the plaintiff said nothing about Aletist in season. He said if he had known Aletist was in season, he would ""absolutely not"" (T 350) have ridden Wrangler to the area where Aletist was situated.

72The description given by the defendant of the circumstances leading to the accident vary, in that the defendant said he saw the horses Aletist and Butterfly facing them, and that Aletist did not have her back turned. He then described what happened as being as follows:

""A. Wrangler took me toward those two horses like a locomotive, I tried pulling him up, I tried turning him, I tried doing everything that I think one could attempt with absolutely no result, I didn't know that we were going to stop at the fence, I was thankful that we did, at that point all I could think about was getting him away from those two horses, one of which or both must have been in season for him to be acting the way he was acting."" (T 352)

73He came to the conclusion that one or other of the horses was in season because of Wrangler's behaviour. He did his best to get Wrangler under control. He told the plaintiff he was abandoning the ride and that she could go on, but that he would have to return with this horse. Wrangler continued to act up, although as they got further away the horse became more relaxed. He did not have any idea where the plaintiff was while he was endeavouring to control Wrangler. Once Wrangler had appeared to become calmer, he said ""okay Lorna, what do you want to do today"" (T 354) and that what subsequently happened was as follows:

""A. I was relaxed, I was comfortable in the saddle and without warning I got chucked to the floor, in picking myself up, Wrangler seemed to momentarily stand still, I asked Lorna to do something, stop him, block him, hold him, whatever, I don't remember those exact words, while I was getting up, which was a split second, as I wasn't injured, Wrangler spun and went racing back toward those two horses. Freckles was running with him in that direction and he reached over and I could tell by the screaming he had a hold of Lorna's leg with his mouth and then somehow dragged her from her saddle and carried her some distance and both horses were beating her up with their hooves and their legs and she was screaming wildly."" (T 354)

74The defendant saw the plaintiff lying on the ground injured in the pathway with the horses still loose. He was reluctant to move her because her leg was obviously fractured and he did not want to cause more injury. His first priority was to get help on the way and he returned to the house as neither of the plaintiff nor the defendant had mobile phones. Because the ambulance arrived, he gathered the horses because the plaintiff was screaming and he observed she had dragged herself under the fence so she did not get trampled again.

Whether Aletist was ""winking""

75The defendant was away from the plaintiff's property during the week when Aletist was put in the top paddock. How could he have known that Aletist was in season? The plaintiff said he knew because she told him. It would otherwise have been up to him to notice this. Mr Lawson, the expert retained by the defendant, states at paragraph 12 of his report (Exhibit 2), that unless the mare is very hormonal, it is easy to miss she is in season unless she is teased. However, the plaintiff's case is that it was particularly obvious that the mare Aletist was in season, because Aletist was ""winking"", namely displaying a stream of liquid from her twitching vulva, which was an indication that she was in season. 

76Did the plaintiff in fact observe Aletist winking, or is this, as the defendant submits, a later invention? Mr Wilson states (written submissions, at paragraph 42) that the statement of claim does not describe prior observation of ""winking"", or the first conversation about it, despite going into considerable detail on a number of other issues and having the opportunity to amend on 1 June 2011. In addition, Mr Wilson submits that I should take into account the failure to refer to the mare Aletist ""winking"" in answers to further and better particulars provided by the plaintiff, to the instructions to the expert, and to the reports of Mr Sanna.

77Exhibit J, which is a letter from Graham Jones Lawyers dated 15 November 2010 to Mr Sanna, does not refer to the mare ""winking"". Mr Sanna's report of 6 December 2010 (Exhibit H) refers to the two mares in the paddock ""one of which at least was posturing towards him"" (page 2). Is ""posturing"" the same as ""winking"", or is Mr Sanna referring to the plaintiff's evidence that Aletist was displaying her rear?

78Whether or not ""posturing"" is the same as ""winking"". Mr Sanna goes on to refer to both ""posturing"" and ""winking"" in his next report of 29 June 2011 (Exhibit H):

""3. On the assumption that the mare ALETIST was posturing towards the stallions as they approached the paddock, Mr Meyer should immediately have turned around to avoid, if it was not already too late, an increasingly dangerous situation. Again, I repeat that not all mares in season engage in open posturing or 'winking' at oncoming horses. The stallion's sense of smell could very easily pick up on a mare in season.""

79Mr Sanna's report was prepared following a letter of 21 June 2011 outlining ""further information with regard to alleged previous behaviour by the stallion ""WRANGLER"" and a request for more detailed information on matters previously covered."" This would suggest that it was not until the letter of 21 June 2011 that the issue of whether ""winking"" occurred was raised. When looking at the letter from Graham Jones Lawyers of 21 June 2011 at paragraph 3, this appears to be correct, in that the following is stated:

""3. We invite your comments regarding the conduct of the defendant on 5 October 2009 on the assumption that as he and the plaintiff were riding they continued to proceed even when they came towards a mare that was ""winking"" or on the assumption that they continued to proceed even when they came towards a mare (noting the time of year).""

80As to the final words in this letter, I note again that both parties have assured me that the plaintiff's claim is brought on actual knowledge, and not upon the fact that the defendant ought to have known that riding into the paddock at that time of year was dangerous. The principal purpose of the letter of 21 June, which was written after the hearing date was vacated, was to ask him to comment about particular (i), which introduced new material about Wrangler's prior disposition. The request for additional comments about ""winking"" (as opposed to merely posturing) suggests that this was not an issue put to Mr Sanna beforehand. The additional particulars also assert that the plaintiff and defendant continued even after they saw Aletist winking, but in fact it was the evidence of both the plaintiff and defendant that they turned their horses around almost immediately when Wrangler began misbehaving. The defendant said he never saw Aletist winking; he assumed from Wrangler's behaviour that one or both of the mares in the paddock must be in season and for this reason turned his horse around to go back. 

81As noted at [75], Mr Lawson, the expert retained by the defendant, stated that it is often difficult to tell whether a mare was in season. This is effectively what Mr Sanna is saying as well, in that whether or not a mare was in season was not always obvious to people as not all mares engage in ""open posturing"" or ""winking""; the stallion's sense of smell could, however, very easily pick up on a mare in season. The inference is that a mare being in season is something which might not be obvious to people, but would be obvious to stallions.

82Mr Sanna was cross-examined about his reference to winking; he stressed that he did not know if the horse had been doing that, as he was not there, but he describes the process as being the emitting of fluid and the contracting of the vulva for most of the period of time that the horse was in season, which could be a few days to up to a week, although some horses in the spring season (September to March) are more or less continuously in season.

83The evidence of the plaintiff about observing the horse Aletist ""winking"" on one occasion when she brought the horses home from the neighbour's property (T 24-25) and a second time when she and the defendant were approaching Aletist (T 40) are provided after pleadings and particulars were sought and expert opinions obtained. It was not part of the plaintiff's claim when Mr Lawson provided his report, which may explain why he does not deal with it. Mr Wilson adds that in cross-examination the plaintiff volunteered other examples of Aletist ""winking"" on previous occasions (T 266) although it was not particularised. He asks the court to find that all this evidence is a recent addition.

84The plaintiff's observations of the horse Aletist ""winking"" was important information for Mr Sanna. Mr Sanna's initial reference to the mare Aletist as ""posturing towards the stallion as they approached the paddock"" suggest that on his instructions, Mr Sanna was not told about the plaintiff's observations of Aletist ""winking"" almost a week earlier. However, I must exercise caution in this regard. It may be that the persons drafting the letter of instruction to Mr Sanna, and the statement of claim, did not appreciate the significance of this evidence.

85As noted above, the question of ""winking"" is linked to the other problem in the letter of instruction, namely the omission in this letter to the conversation the plaintiff said she had with the defendant about ""winking"" prior to the day of the accident. All those particulars say are as follows:

""The Plaintiff and Defendant started to saddle up at about 2.30pm on 5 October 2009. As the Defendant was on his horse and the Plaintiff was getting stirrups and girth organised she said to the Defendant words to the effect ""Will Wrangles [sic] be okay with Aletist up there? She is in season don't forget."" The Defendant replied with words to the effect ""He should be fine.""""

86The evidence of the plaintiff on this issue has, Mr Wilson submits, a fundamental inconsistency. Firstly, the plaintiff agreed in cross-examination that she had never taken notice of Aletist's cycles prior to this event, despite saying that Aletist had a tendency to wink while in season (T 185), although mares are in season about once a month for up to a week:

""Q. Did you take any specific notice over that period of two years about her behaviour in the period when she was seasonal, for example winking behaviour?
A. I would have noticed it but I don't know that I made any specific note to myself in relation to that.

Q. Are you able to say whether she showed any obvious visible signs of being in season?
A. Aw well, she would wink when she was in season.

Q. And did you notice for how long that occurred for?
A. I can't answer that at this point. I'm aware that the season lasts about a week give or take depending on - apparently horses are all different, but I don't have any - what am I trying to say, I hadn't made any particular observations in terms of her patterns of behaviour if you like in relation to when she was in season other than if she was I would see it.

Q. Would her season go only for two or three days where she was exhibiting signs of winking?
A. I'm not sure that my - well I may well have made observations along those lines, I don't recall them now. Yep, sorry, I'm not sure what else I can say.

Q. In relation to a mare being in season are you at the present moment aware of the seriousness in relation to keeping a mare away from a stallion during that period of time?
A. I certainly am today."" (T 185)

87The plaintiff went on to say that this was the reason why she had put these horses in the paddock the furthest away from his stallion and up at the back of the property (T 186).

88However the plaintiff said elsewhere in her evidence that this was the first time she had ever put horses in the arena paddock. She was very firm about this evidence. Yet Aletist was a horse which, according to her, winked regularly when in season, and would have been doing so while not only the plaintiff's stallion was on the property, but also while another stallion owned by the plaintiff had been on the property. 

89The plaintiff gave evidence about horses being kept in various paddocks at various times, but there was no system for keeping mares in season apart from stallions. She said at T 187 that this was because she was not aware of there being any danger:

""Q. You must have been aware of the dangers associated with putting a stallion in the vicinity of a mare in season, you must have been aware of that danger?
A. Well I certainly am now.

...

Q. You must have been aware of that danger?
A. No, I was not aware."" (T 186-187)

90She repeated at T 189:

""Q. You realised at that time the potential danger of that situation?
A. Like I said I was aware that his horse was a stallion and the circumstances of where we were going. I was not aware, although I am now, of the dangers that were awaiting.""

91The defendant in written submissions calls attention to the inconsistency between the plaintiff making a point of telling the defendant, and then reminding him a second time, about something she did not consider to be important. The defendant's evidence was that if he had known, he would never have taken his horse into the vicinity. 

92In written submissions, Mr Jones refers to the cross-examination at T 186 line 6-14 as follows:

""Q. So were you aware of the need to keep, and this is again going back to the time of your injury in October 2009, were you aware of the need or the caution not to put a stallion near a mare who was in season?
A. Yes.

Q. You were aware of that?
A. Well, and that's why I had advised Allan where I had put the horses and noted to him that they were the farthest away from his stallion and up the back of the property.""


93However the plaintiff went on to say that she was not aware of the dangers of taking a stallion into a paddock where there was a mare in season as at 5 October 2009 (T 186 lines 25-28):

""Q. Well as at 5 October 2009 when you were injured, were you aware of the dangers associated with taking a stallion into a paddock where there was a mare which was in season?
A. No.""

94Viewed in its totality, I am satisfied that, whether she observed Aletist ""winking"" or not, the plaintiff did not realise the danger of riding a stallion into a paddock where there was a mare in season. This is a relevant matter to take into account when considering whether the plaintiff told the defendant about Aletist's condition, and sought confirmation about any danger on the day of the accident. These inconsistencies cast real doubt upon whether the plaintiff did in fact observe Aletist winking, or appreciate its significance if she did.

Issues of credit

95In relation to this issue, the defendant has made submissions about the plaintiff's credit, which I summarise as follows:

(a)The plaintiff attempted to downplay her experience with horses, to minimise her experience and to maximise her asserted reliance upon the defendant, whom she portrayed as giving her lessons;

(b)The plaintiff's specific answers in relation to questions such as whether Wrangler and Freckles had been ridden through paddocks with mares before (T 91), as opposed to very general answers when asked whether Wrangler had misbehaved or acted badly during the time he was on the property prior to her accident (T 90). The plaintiff did not answer the question and when it was asked again (T 94) it is asserted she was evasive. 

(c)The plaintiff and defendant were in a relationship which has now come to an end; and

(d)The conduct of the plaintiff, including speaking to a witness during the adjournment. 

96While great caution needs to be exercised when making findings of credit about witnesses, the way that the plaintiff minimised her prior experience with horses is relevant to this issue. In examination in chief, she portrayed herself as inexperienced and lacking in knowledge, and claimed to consult the defendant for lessons and advice, when she had been an experienced horsewoman since her early years; she had not only owned horses, but ridden in races, worked as a trail guide and worked at ""Horselands"". Horses were her main interest in life. The other matters relied on by the defendant are not, however, of relevance to the plaintiff's credit.

97Did the plaintiff rely upon the defendant's superior horse expertise? The plaintiff's written submissions (at paragraph 50) assert that there is reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant's horse expertise ""such that she was prepared to obey and conform to the directions he gave her"" and that she held his horse abilities in high regard (T 21 line 5). The plaintiff's written submissions also claim that she sought out and obtained lessons and instructions from ""persons such as the defendant"", particularly with regard to western riding (paragraph 47) and that he advised her in relation to the selection of horses (T 20). 

98The plaintiff did not give evidence of having lessons from anyone other than the defendant, and the details of these were extremely vague. Nor was there evidence that he advised her on the selection of horses; it was the plaintiff's decision to enter into a sell and swap agreement in relation to her horses, and on her own evidence the most she did was to consult the defendant about western riding lessons in this regard. Nor was there evidence of his being involved in the management of the property and animals on a day-to-day basis, apart from performing tasks at the plaintiff's request such as feeding the horses (written submissions, paragraph 51). The long hours the defendant was working, and the extent of his absences from the property, were not apparent until the defendant gave evidence.

99The plaintiff also submits that if the defendant was aware that the mares had been returned to the property at the height of the breeding season, then ""it is likely he would have made that enquiry of the plaintiff"" (written submissions, paragraph 83). No transcript reference was given for this, and I cannot find a question which amounts to putting this proposition to the defendant in these terms. The defendant submits, and I accept, that submissions of this nature would fall outside the case as pleaded and particularised.

100The plaintiff made a concerted attack upon the credit of the defendant both in cross-examination and in written submissions. It was put to the defendant that he had exaggerated his prior history of horse training activities (T 356-360) and that he exaggerated his involvement in the training of champions (T 360). In addition, it is claimed that the defendant acknowledged his wrongdoing by having the horse Wrangler shot. (This is dealt with in more detail in the section of this judgment at [242] - [249] below.)

101The plaintiff's written submissions also refer to the evidence of the defendant and Mr Boileau that when the defendant and Ms Fenner (the defendant's former wife) joined Mr Boileau on a brumby hunt, there would have been mares in season. The defendant said in his evidence that he was not apprehensive about taking Wrangler into a situation where he could be confronted by a mare in season, which the plaintiff submits in evidence that the defendant was unconcerned about the danger.

102However, this answer needs to be seen in context. Not even Ms Fenner gave evidence to this effect that it was dangerous to take Wrangler on a brumby hunt where there could be mares in season. Nor did the experts give evidence to this effect. The brumby hunt was an exercise in locating and attempting to capture brumbies, by a number of riders. It is the kind of activity to which I assume Mr Lawson is referring in his report where he says that the mere fact that a horse is a stallion does not mean that the horse should be ""closeted away and never interact with other horses"". It is up to the rider or handler of the stallion to look for possible problems or conflicts that could arise (Exhibit 2, paragraph 15) and this is what the defendant did on the brumby hunt.

Conclusions concerning the conversations alleged by the plaintiff

103I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not appreciate the dangers of a stallion being ridden into a field where a mare in season was to be found, and that the conversation she alleges took place on the day of the accident never occurred at all. I am similarly satisfied that any conversation the plaintiff had with the defendant about seven days beforehand, on the day she brought Aletist home from agistment, did not include any reference to Aletist being in season, either because the plaintiff did not notice that Aletist was in season, or because she did not appreciate its significance. Taking all of the above into account, the plaintiff has not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that either of the conversations she deposed to took place. 

104There are additional problems. The conversation on the day of the horses being brought back to the property seven days before the accident would not amount to an appropriate provision of information about riding dangers a week later to the defendant, who was living away from the property and who had returned, it would appear, only on the day of the accident. The crucial conversation is the conversation which took place at about 2.30pm on 5 October 2009, which occurred when the defendant was already on his horse heading out of the stable and the plaintiff was getting stirrups and girth organised (Exhibit J, page 1). The plaintiff and defendant had already decided to go for a ride and were on their way. This is not a conversation of reliance; it is a discussion between two experienced horse riders of a very brief nature, which is relevant to the issue of both volenti and obvious risk.

105However, if the defendant had knowledge of prior bad disposition of the horse Wrangler, and of the horse's tendency to become excited in the presence of other horses, whether mares or not, that would be a different basis upon which negligence could be asserted, and it is to this evidence that I now turn.

106None of these incidents involved a horse in season. A finding of the horse having a bad disposition is evidence I could accept independent of any finding as to whether or not the defendant knew that the horse Aletist was in season.

Evidence in relation to the prior bad disposition of the horse Wrangler

107It was the addition of particular 10(i) to the Amended Statement of Claim, concerning the alleged known propensity of Wrangler to become excited or agitated in the presence of other horses which led to the adjournment of the proceedings before Elkaim DCJ on 1 June 2011.

108The plaintiff, in the opening to these proceedings, identified three examples as follows:

""Now if I could just stop there because your Honour will also hear some evidence that there'd been problems with this stallion Wrangler in the past. Particularly in the presence of other horses and particularly mares. Your Honour will hear evidence that at one stage whilst the defendant was riding Wrangler with another person who was riding a mare Wrangler had, whilst the other rider was still on the mare, attempted to mount the mare and that is particularly dangerous. Such that Mr Sanna says that if that had been known Wrangler would have been banned from any competition because of the dangerousness demonstrated by that action. It would be classified as a dangerous horse. 

Furthermore, in the past Wrangler had escaped from its paddock and this is before the defendant knew the plaintiff in order to try and gain access to a paddock in which there were some mares and Wrangler had, as it were, gone quite berserk charging up and down the fence trying to get into the paddock where the mares were. 

Then on a third occasion, also in the presence of other horses, Wrangler had been taken to a show and it had been secured to the horse trailer and then, in the presence of the other horses, had spent its time rearing and what's called screaming. So that it was known that this horse, Wrangler, had difficulties in the presence of other horses particularly mares."" (T 3)

109The plaintiff's own evidence does not touch upon any of these events, which occurred prior to her association with the defendant. As counsel for the defendant points out in his submissions (paragraph 137), the plaintiff is limited to the pleading. There are no particulars indicating that the horse Wrangler is alleged to have misbehaved in the presence of the plaintiff prior to the events on the day in question.

110The principal witness to these events, on the part of the plaintiff, was the defendant's former wife, Ms Kate Fenner (T 284ff). The defendant called three witnesses: Mr Boileau, Mr Burgun and Mr Chant.

111Mr Sanna, the plaintiff's expert witness, provided reports dated 6 December 2010, 9 May 2011 and 29 June 2011. These were short reports and the subject of some qualifications in the witness box. His evidence on relevant issues is referred to in relation to the particulars of negligence set out in this judgment.

112Mr Robert A Lawson, the defendant's expert witness, provided a four-page report which is Exhibit 2. He was not cross-examined. The contents of that report are also referred to where appropriate in relation to the particulars of negligence set out in this judgment.

(i) The Braidwood incident in 2006

113This was particularised as follows:

""In about 2006 in Braidwood the defendant was riding Wrangler and another person was riding a mare. As the horses were attempting to go through a gate Wrangler tried to mount the mare whilst it was being ridden.""

114Ms Fenner's evidence of these events is that in 2006 she and the defendant were at a property near Braidwood to take part in the rounding up of some wild brumbies. Ms Fenner was riding a horse she had bought in Australia as a three year old, which had just been broken in, so the horse had been under saddle for a very short time. The defendant was riding Wrangler. She described what happened as follows:

""A. We came to a gate and Alan was, in an attempt to open the gate and the horses obviously got too close to each other and Wrangler tried to mount my mare and as he did that he came down and one of his front feet landed quite heavily on my knee and that was quite painful so I moved my horse away and we eventually got through the gate, I can't really recall how, but I just made sure I kept a good distance away from him after that.

Q. How long have you been riding horses for?
A. All my life.

Q. And how did you regard in terms of horse play, the attempt by Wrangler to mount your mare?
A. Well it just told me that he wasn't under proper control. It is extremely dangerous if a horse rears up you know he could have, he hit my knee which was probably quite lucky, he could have hit my back, he could have hit my head, it is a very dangerous situation."" (T 294-295)

115In cross-examination, Ms Fenner discounted the inexperience of Wrangler, who was on his first trip of this kind, and the new surroundings in which he found himself (T 295) and said that the horses ""got too close to one another"" (T 295 line 47). The question was whether Wrangler attempted to mount the horse or was merely prancing around. If it was the latter, such conduct was, in the opinion of the plaintiff's expert Mr Sanna, completely unexceptional:

""A. Well my take on that is that there is a sort of, there's a bunch of things in there that I don't think were appropriate handing the reins of stallion to someone sitting on a mare was pretty inappropriate. It seems to me, maybe Mr Meyers was being a gentleman and doing the gate, I would have kicked the wife off and got her to do the gate if I was on a young excitable stallion. But given that he felt compelled to do the gate I though handing the stallion to her was probably not a smart thing to do. We are dealing with a totally different set of facts. If you're asking me was it a great piece of horsemanship no but it he didn't mount the horse then it didn't mount the horse I don't know.

HER HONOUR

Q. We are more interested in the horse than the skills of rider. The thing is that this is a horse that had just been broken who was on its first trip out, bulked [sic] a bit at a gate and was then prancing around. Now is this a horse that's dangerous, unruly?
A. No it's pretty much what you would expect from a young horse and especially a young stallion. If he didn't mount the horse and he was being held next to it by the reins by someone sitting on mare and he didn't try and mount it then he deserves a gold star."" (T 152)

116Wrangler, at about 14 and 2 hands high, was not as tall as Ms Fenner's mare, which was 15 and 2 hands high. Ms Fenner was certain that Wrangler had to raise his front end in what she called ""a rear or mounting motion"" because he had landed downwards on her knee (T 296).

117Ms Fenner suffered no injury to her knee beyond a bruise. It did not require any treatment, or even a brief rest. Another person called by the defendant, a Mr Campbell Boileau, who travelled with the defendant and Ms Fenner on what he called the ""brumby chase"" (T 414) not only knew nothing about this incident, but knew nothing about any bad behaviour by Wrangler throughout the trip. He commented at T 415:

""Q. What was your observations of Wrangler's behaviour during the course of the brumby chase or being on that property during the brumby chase?
A. When the horses were penned at night I didn't appear to have any trouble with Wrangler upsetting the other horses or - I mean he could have whinnied or squealed or rushed the fences if he'd wanted to get to the other horses but I didn't observe anything like that. During the riding, the day when we crossed paths with Alan I didn't see any real problems. I was just - I was worried at the time because there are stallions in amongst the other brumbies so I was just mindful that may have attacked someone else's horses but we didn't have any problems anywhere like that.""

118Mr Boileau said that the herd of 200 to 300 brumbies which they were chasing would have included mares in season (T 417) and that Wrangler appeared to behave appropriately during the times that Mr Boileau encountered the horse. He recalled one occasion when he saw Wrangler being excited, but when on to explain that this was the case for all the horses:

""JONES: I'm looking at the behaviour and the controllability of the horse on this muster.

WITNESS: I would say that the behaviour was that of a three-year-old horse but not a stallion. I noticed that he wasn't - he didn't attack other horses or do anything like that, but he was just simply an excited horse galloping amongst other horses, the same as all our horses were at the time."" (T 419)

119Mr Boileau was aware of the events in which the plaintiff was injured and the defendant subsequently had Wrangler put down. He described a conversation with the defendant as follows:

""A. He said to me that he did it for the sake of Lorna coming back that she wouldn't have to see the horse. He said to me that Lorna had an accident, he said that the horse had taken her off the horse, carried it in its mouth and she was in hospital and that he'd had the horse put down so that when Lorna came back the horse wouldn't be there.

Q. And at any stage had he approached you about agisting the use perhaps on your property?
A. No he hadn't. I think he rang me two or three days after the accident to let me know that Lorna had had an accident and that she was in hospital and what had caused the accident.

...

Q. Did he, that is Mr Meyer, discuss with you the dangers that had been associated with that day in question, that is the day that Wrangler attacked Lorna Watson?
A. I just don't quite understand. He just simply told me that the horse had attacked Lorna or had become aggressive and injured Lorna and then that he'd had the horse but down, other than that I didn't ask him any questions about whether he thought it was a wise thing to do or not, I just accepted it, that it was after the fact and there was no point in trying to change anything."" (T 422-423)

120As is noted elsewhere, the Braidwood incident was the one upon which Mr Sanna based his opinion, in that he uncritically accepted the account of events given by the plaintiff, namely that of a rider put in danger by reason of one horse trying to mount another without inquiry as to whether the horse was sexually excited or whether there was another explanation for these events. Mr Sanna's revision of this evidence in the witness box at T 152 was significant.

Conclusions concerning the Braidwood incident

121Ms Fenner is the defendant's former wife. Caution should be exercised when considering issues of credibility of a witness, but Ms Fenner's hostility towards her former husband was very evident. She was dismissive of his claim that he had trained three international champions (T 299) and referred a number of times to Wrangler as having insufficient training (for example T 302-303 and 313) and as having caused her concern in relation to each of the three incidents, in dramatic terms (for example ""very dangerous, quite frightening"" at T 297).

122Ms Fenner suffered no injury beyond a bruised knee which does not appear to have prevented her carrying out her activities on the day in question. Mr Boileau, who was also present, did not even know about this incident. 

123All of this suggests an incident of minor proportions. I also note the concessions of Mr Sanna in cross-examination, in which he revised the opinions he expressed in his report.

124Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that this was not evidence of Wrangler behaving dangerously, but the horse rearing simply because another horse had come too close. It is not evidence of Wrangler's bad disposition.

(ii) The paddock escape incident in 2007

125Ms Fenner described this event as follows:

""A. Alan and I came in, in the car, initially he decided he might try and sort of round him up in the car, which obviously wasn't going to work we realised that very quickly, and we got out of the car and he was trying to catch him, but Wrangler was very excited and it was really a very dangerous quite frightening situation because the stallion was galloping the fence line and he wouldn't be caught and he - we did eventually catch him but it took quite some time, I was quite nervous."" (T 297)

126The particulars relied upon by the plaintiff were read by Mr Wilson for the defendant to Mr Sanna in cross-examination, and Mr Sanna's response is of relevance, given the defendant's admission that his failure to lock the gate was the reason Wrangler had got out:

""Q. The second incident that you have been provided information about and I will read from the letter of instruction. 

""In about 2007 Wrangler got out of his paddock and got into a paddock close to two mares. Wrangler was charging around and was very excited and agitated. The defendant had great difficulty restraining the horse and requested assisted from another person who was present.""

I think you evidence is that that really didn't cause you any real concern or the facts didn't form any basis for your opinion that Wrangler was unruly or of an unruly disposition?
A. No I agree with that, that's what you would expect with any stallion. The only thing is it depends on how he got out of the paddock. If someone left the gate open or did he clamber through a decent well built fence to try and get to the mares? That's more the issue. I have no information on that, if someone e [sic] left the gate open or if it was a flimsy little bit of electric tape or something like that and he just stepped over it, then that's to be expected. If he clambered through a decent sort of fence to get to the mares that exhibits a little bit more, well a lot more, than normal behaviour."" (T 152-153)

127Mr Sanna went on to explain at T 153:

""Q. One night after accomplishing the evening feed routine one of the gates was neglected and left open. This allow two mares, one of which was known to be in season, to share a common fence with Wrangler that's what occurred?
A. So then he probably clambered through the fence. Did he get in with the mares or.

Q. Because of the fact that they were adjacent?
A. Yes.

Q. So that behaviour would be quite natural?
A. Well you'd expect him to get inside if he can get up against the mares for sure. There are some stallions who, as I say, are not especially interested but most stallions would behave in that way.""

128The defendant blamed himself for this incident. He had not locked the gate, and he said this was why the horse had got out of the paddock:

""Q. There was an incident involving - when Wrangler got into a common fenced area whilst you were living at Tiyces Lane, is that correct?
A. That's correct.

Q. Could you describe to the Court what occurred on this occasion?
A. One night I forgot to close the gate after feeding, which allowed two mares to get to a common fence with Wrangler, and during the night I think he must have jumped the fence and was out with them the next morning when I went down to feed again.

Q. And when you say that he was with the mares, what was he doing?
A. He was grazing, so were the mares."" (T 334) 

129The defendant's cross-examination did not include a challenge to his admission that he had forgotten to close the gate:

""Q. You told the court that there was an incident in which Wrangler got in with two mares at Ticey's Lane and you told the court that when you went there he was grazing with the mares. Can I rather suggest to you that you and Kate Fenner were - you came upon the property and Wrangler was running up and down and you and Kate Fenner had to try and restrain him and retrieve him, do you agree with that?
A. No because I was the one that always did the feeding, I was the one that went down there and discovered that he was out and you don't restrain an animal. I put a halter on him, I did go up and tell Kate that he was out and asked her to assist me and we went down and haltered him and walked him back to his paddock.
Q. Wrangler was galloping along the fence line wasn't he?
A. He may have - yeah galloping, no I don't think he knew how to gallop but he was cantering.

Q. It would be wrong to give the impression that he was simply standing in the paddock grazing on some food with these mares, that would be wrong wouldn't it?
A. No we're comparing apples and oranges. When I first went down there he was quiet as and grazing. I went back and told Kate and asked her to come down with me because there was going to be an obvious need to get the mares as well for the typical after next morning shot.

Q. If he was just grazing you could have gone up to Wrangler, taken hold of him and put him back in his own paddock, couldn't you?
A. I did.

Q. You wouldn't have needed Kate Fenner to do that?
A. I just explained why I went and got Kate.

Q. All I'm putting to you is that you didn't need Kate if Wrangler was simply standing there grazing food?
A. Need no, probably not.

HER HONOUR

Q. Well one moment, am I right in thinking your evidence was that you put Wrangler back and you got her to give the morning after shots to the mares?
A. Yes your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Well that's what he said.

JONES

Q. Didn't you need the two of you to try and get Wrangler?
A. No."" (T 379-380)

Conclusions concerning the paddock escape incident in 2007

130Ms Fenner's account of this event was overly dramatic (""very dangerous"", ""quite frightening"", ""quite nervous"" - T 297). The defendant said he was to blame for not locking the gate. Mr Sanna agreed at T 153 that most stallions would behave in this way. This is not an incident of significance and does not demonstrate the conduct asserted in particular (i).

(iii) The Wingadene show incident in 2007

131The third particular of prior bad behaviour by Wrangler was as follows:

""At the Wingadene show in 2007 Wrangler was misbehaving and was screaming and rearing in the presence of other horses. Wrangler was excited and agitated for most of the day and had to be restrained.""

132Ms Fenner described this as follows:

""Q. In 2007 at some stage did you and Mr Meyer go to the Windradyne [sic] Show?
A. Yeah Windradyne Quarter Horse Show yes.

Q. And was Wrangler taken along?
A. Wrangler was taken along, along with the old polo pony that my son rode.

Q. Now at some stage was Wrangler secured to a trailer or horse float?
A. Yes he was.

Q. And did something happen?
A. Yes he just was very badly behaved he was raring, sort of jumping up and down and calling out all the time and just very restless and quite badly behaved.

Q. How long did that behaviour go on for?
A. The rest of the day that we were there, Alan took him in some classes and for western, the horse is supposed to be very relaxed and have its head low and Wrangler had his head quite high and he wouldn't jog and he was trotting and he was basically very excited all day long.

Q. And were there other horses in the immediate vicinity?
A. Yes, yes.

Q. Now Mr - we are told that Mr Meyer says that he settled down the horse and went on to win a medal at that show, what do you know about that?
A. I know that he did come home with a couple of ribbons from the show. I also remember that he didn't actually beat any other horses, if you - I remember one of the classes there was three horses in hit and he got a third, and he went in a couple of other classes, but I don't remember him actually beating another horse and I don't know what the medal is about, I don't think any medals were awarded at the show."" (T 297-298)

133Mr Sanna's evidence was as follows:

""Q. The third incident that you were provided with was at the Wingadene(?) show in 2007. Wrangler was misbehaving. Was screaming and rearing in the presence of other horses. Wrangler was excited and agitated for most of the day and had to be restrained. Did you place much emphasis on that as a basis for any opinion?
A. Only to form a view that it's not a dobbin. You know like with a dobbin, in the industry something that's really quiet. I mean he's obviously, he has a propensity to get excited and in certain situations he appears not to be very quiet and very amenable in certain situations and I can see in certain situations, as from the photograph with the ..(not transcribable).. on him he's very, very quiet.

Q. Yes. If the facts in that situation were just briefly that Wrangler didn't want to be tied to the trailer as everyone passed by, walked past that particular trailer and he demonstrated this by calling and frolicking though he was a nuisance he didn't interrupt the show or break away or run amok as some horses tend to do and also Mr Meyer saddled him and rode him in open company in the warm up arena thereafter until it was time for him to show. The first event for him was the stallion class and he did very well. Then later in that day he was again ridden in open and mixed company, in other classes, to demonstrate his ability to perform under saddle. He was well placed in these particular events. This was a sanctioned show and if the judges had deemed him to be a danger or disruptive he would've been expelled. So does that set of circumstances change your view about the manner in which Wrangler behaved on that occasion?
A. I think it's normal. They get excited. They're put in a particular place. They don't particularly want to be there. They get excited. They scream and holler and maybe kick out at anything that comes past. That's why, in our sport, we have to have green discs on the horses, on stallions, so they're identified by other competitors. So they have a green disc on their bridle or on their saddle cloth to identify them because they're much more likely to kick or to be unruly. When the horses are tied to the float they have to wear the green disc and the float has to have a green disc on it so people walking by aren't going to get too close because they're very likely to try and lash out and kick anything that comes by and then the fact that he's then ridden. That means he's becoming a trained horse and he knows by and large sometimes that he's to behave himself. That's all I think sort of normal stallion stuff.

Q. So again the factual basis is now that you've been appeased of maybe an alternate set of facts in relation to those three events, does that change your opinion about the demeanour or character of Wrangler?
A. Yes it does although I wrote my first report without any reference to that information which came along fairly later so just, you know stallions are stallions and they need to be - they're never to be taken for granted. That's the bottom line.

Q. And that fact that stallions are never to be taken for granted is something which is well known in the horse industry isn't it?
A. Of course, yeah.""(T 153-154)

134The defendant said in his evidence that this had been the first time he had driven to the show and he had parked his car in the worst possible place in that, having arrived early, he picked a spot which turned out to be on the main thoroughfare where there was a lot of noise and there were many passing horses. He said that this was what distressed the horse, but that the horse's distress had not prevented him from entering the competitions he had been brought to enter, and from receiving a prize.

135The only issue of bad conduct about which the defendant was cross-examined was as follows:

""Q. At Wingerdeen [sic] Show was not only excited and calling he was also rearing wasn't he?
A. No he was tied to the trailer at the point I think you're bringing in the question, and being tied to a trailer it's impossible to rear."" (T 380)

Conclusions concerning the Wingadene show incident in 2007

136This is conduct that was described by Mr Sanna as ""normal"" for stallions. On the day in question, Wrangler was still well-behaved enough to participate in events and to win a prize.

137There was other evidence about Wrangler's behaviour at pony club shows, where he was able to mix in a quiet fashion with children and to be taken through his paces by the defendant.

138The plaintiff's claims in relation to particular (i) concerning the Wingadene show incident have not been made out.

Other evidence about the disposition of Wrangler

139The defendant points to the following evidence which is inconsistent with evidence of a horse which is troublesome in nature, and/or known by its owner to be troublesome:

(a)Photographs of Ms Fenner's nephew George (a small boy, about 10 years old) riding Wrangler were hard to explain after the alleged ""bad behaviour"" she claimed Wrangler had shown (T 298 and T 303)Ms Fenner described the circumstances of this photograph as follows:

""Q. And what can you tell us about the circumstances of the photographs being taken?
A. I think George had wanted to have a ride on a horse and Wrangler was there, I mean George has got his helmet on he is sitting on the horse, the stirrups haven't been adjusted or anything but Alan is very close by and he is leading him in most of them, I then remember I asked him just to step aside so we could get a picture of George riding the horse, you know, all by himself, so Alan was just outside the frame of the photograph, but the horse is you know, in its own environment, there are not other horses about and no reason why it shouldn't be quite quiet which it was.

Q. Now what do you say about any suggestion that such a photograph is consistent with a docile Wrangler stallion?
A. Well I think that stallions aren't sort of thinking about mounting mares all of the time and if you have them in a situation where there aren't any other horses about, like this is, and it is in its home environment, there's nothing unusual going on and the horse is just lazily walking around the arena, I don't think it is particularly unusual, I don't think it says particularly anything about the horses actions in other situations or if you put another horse there it would be quite a different animal. So I don't think it is very-"" (T 298)

Ms Fenner said in cross-examination that she would not have allowed her nephew to go near the horse if there is another horse around. However, she went on to say that she had never permitted her nephew to ride any of those other stallions.

(b)Ms Fenner permitting Wrangler to remain on her property with other horses in season.Ms Fenner agreed that she never remembered seeing Wrangler bolting while he was riding (T 305), that there were mares on her property which had been in season, and that she had never witnessed any problems the defendant had with Wrangler in relation to these horses:

""Q. There was times that Mr Meyer would have written on that property when there was mares in season, that is correct, isn't it?
A. Yeah, but he never rode through paddocks.

Q. No, I am not suggesting that I am just saying in the vicinity of them riding past them within 20 metres or whatever distance it would have been when you're riding along past a paddock where a horse is in it?
A. Mm.

Q. And there were never any incidents that you can recall or you witnessed whereby Mr Meyer had problems with Wrangler in that regard?
A. No, not when he was on the horse.

Q. The only incident that you have given evidence about was this incident whereby in 2007 Wrangler got out of his paddock and got into another paddock close to two mares?
A. Yep.

Q. That is normal behaviour sometimes for a horse, isn't it, to get in and be a little bit frisky, charging around with other horses when they are not used to those horses, that is normal behaviour, isn't it?
A. For a stallion, yes, because they're quite dangerous too. It is quite dangerous to be around.

Q. I appreciate that. Stallions are quite dangerous to be around, aren't they?
A. They can be, yes.

Q. You know that?
A. I do.

Q. You're a woman who has extensive experience in the horse industry?
A. Mm.

Q. You need to answer?
A. I do, I do I suppose, yes.

Q. It is common knowledge in the horse industry, isn't it, that stallions are dangerous?
A. It depends on what you're doing with the stallion. I mean if you have a loose stallion it is a dangerous thing. If you have a stallion a well trained stallion that's under control, it is not necessarily a dangerous thing. I mean I think it depends on the stallion, it depends on the stallion's level of training.

...

Q. Even if he is in an environment whereby there are other horses around in their paddocks and he is in his own paddock then just like he was at your property?
A. Yeah but he was a long way away from other horses in my property so I mean in this new property, I don't know, it would depend I mean if he is very close to another horse then he can smell the other horse he might get excited I couldn't tell you, I don't know. I don't know how close he is. I have no idea.

Q. If a horse is on - a stallion is on a property for ten months, doesn't cause any problems then you would have to, in your experience, have to imagine that the horse is reasonably comfortable and has acclimatised to the other horses around, wouldn't you?
A. You'd have to assume that nothing at all changed."" (T 306-307)

Ms Fenner agreed that apart from the incidents she had described in court, she had no other incident upon which she could express any opinion that Wrangler was not comfortable or well-behaved around other horses (T 308).

(c)The Defendant rode Wrangler in the vicinity of other horses whilst on Ms Fenner's property without Wrangler causing any problems (T 304).This included riding on occasions when there were mares on the property in season (T 305), participating in horse shows where there were many other horses present and rides Ms Fenner took with the defendant where he was riding Wrangler.

140Mr James Chant agisted Wrangler on his property for two to three months. No precise dates were given for this, but it was during the period of time between the defendant's separation from Ms Fenner and his going to live at the plaintiff's home, so it would have been about a year before the accident. He was able to observe Wrangler's behaviour almost every day, as the paddock was close to his workshop. He said that Wrangler did not cause any problems, in that he was not a horse standing at the gate trying to get out. He said ""he was no problem, he was never a concern"" (T 478). On one occasion, when the farrier came, Mr Chant's daughter went into the paddock and caught Wrangler without difficulty (T 479).

141Mr Chant also observed Wrangler at a pony club event. Mr Chant was one of the persons in charge, and was very busy, but said that if the horse had been playing up, it would have immediately come to his attention (T 481).

142Mr Burgun, the manager of rural operations for the Sydney University, manages a number of properties for Sydney University running their livestock operations (T 447). He resides on a mixed grazing enterprise with merino sheep and beef cattle at Marulan, as well as other properties for the university. There is a horse unit at Camden and Mr Burgun uses stock horses on the property he works on. He has seven horses, in addition his children are recreationally involved in a pony club. He described Wrangler participating in pony club rallies on three or four occasions and he described the horse as ""reserved and under control"" (T 468). The defendant took him to the pony club to show how horses were broken; this was a demonstration for children. 

143Mr Burgun said he had been physically attacked a horse which bit him because he had some hay the horse wanted (T 468-469). Mr Chant gave similar evidence (at T 481), as did Mr Boileau. All three witnesses made it clear that horses can be dangerous. Wrangler, however, was a well-behaved horse.

Conclusion concerning Wrangler's disposition

144Mr Sanna commented:

""Q. If a stallion such as Wrangler was on a property for a period of ten months, would it be fair to say that observing Wrangler over that period of time if there was no observations of any unruly behaviour that you would consider that a horse such as Wrangler would be of good disposition?
A. I think it is fair to say that that's how you form an assessment of a horse, the longer time you spend with it the more likely you are to predict what he is likely to do.

Q. If I was to suggest to you that Wrangler was on the property which you went - the plaintiff's property, Ebenezer for a period of ten months and during that period of time that there were no difficulties with the handling of Wrangler whilst he was being ridden around by Mr Meyer on a regular basis where there were mares in paddocks - would you say that Wrangler would then be a horse of good disposition?
A. Certainly very relevant that sort of history, yeah."" (T 135)

145The plaintiff had no prior experience of bad conduct or incidence involving Wrangler, although she was reluctant to concede this (T 90 and 94). The three incidents referred to by Ms Fenner, the defendant's former wife, are set out above. I have rejected these claims. Mr Sanna, the plaintiff's expert, made appropriate concessions in cross-examination when additional factual material was provided to him. The three witnesses called by the defendant gave objective and convincing evidence about their personal observations of Wrangler. Questions were put to them by Mr Jones in cross-examination about the defendant's conduct on the day of the accident, and about incidents which these witnesses had not observed, but as these were lay witnesses, I propose to treat this evidence with caution. The evidence of their personal observations of Wrangler is, however, in a different category as it is direct observation rather than surmise or opinion. 

146All of the evidence points to Wrangler being, for a stallion, a well-behaved horse with no prior history of misbehaviour. There is no prior history of his attacking anyone due to excitement because there was a mare in season; he had behaved well in the presence of the plaintiff and the horses she rode on other occasions; he had behaved well in the presence of objective observers who were themselves quite skilled horsemen, such as Mr Burgun, Mr Boileau and Mr Chant; he had behaved well in the presence of children; he appears from all accounts to have been a well trained horse in that the defendant is a skilled horse trainer. These findings of fact are relevant to a number of the particulars, but principally to particular (i). 

The existence of a duty

147The first question is whether or not there is a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff in relation to the case as pleaded. The plaintiff in written submissions (paragraph 33) draws my attention to the statement in Flemming Law of Torts, 10th Edition 2011 at [17.100] that:

""The ordinary duty of care requires that an animal, like anything else under one's control, does not become the source of harm to others. It matters nothing whether the Defendant causes a collision by negligently driving his car or galloping a horse.""

148The defendant in written submissions draws my attention to the statement of Beazley JA in Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells [2010] NSWCA 147 at [34]-[35]:

""[34] Notwithstanding a tendency for judges to cling to Mason J's formulation in Wyong v Shirt, claims for personal injury damages are now governed by the Civil Liability Act, subject to the exclusionary provisions of Pt 1 and, perhaps, cases which involve positive acts of negligence, to which I refer later.

[35] In Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem [2009] HCA 48 the High Court, at [11], warned that if attention was not directed to the Civil Liability Act first, there was a serious risk that ""inquiries about duty, breach and causation would miscarry"".""

149The defendant also refers to Doubleday v Kelly [2005] NSWCA 151 at [15]-[16], where the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of the response of a reasonable person in the position of the defendant as to the foreseeability of risk of injury.

150The law of negligence is governed by the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). It is necessary, when considering actions for negligence, to start by setting out the relevant statutory provisions.

151The Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) in Division 2 (headed ""Duty of care"") sets out general and other principles at ss 5B and 5C as follows:

""5B General principles 

(1) A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless: 

(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and 

(b) the risk was not insignificant, and 

(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions. 

(2) In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things): 

(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken, 

(b) the likely seriousness of the harm, 

(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm, 

(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm. 

5C Other principles 

In proceedings relating to liability for negligence: 

(a) the burden of taking precautions to avoid a risk of harm includes the burden of taking precautions to avoid similar risks of harm for which the person may be responsible, and 

(b) the fact that a risk of harm could have been avoided by doing something in a different way does not of itself give rise to or affect liability for the way in which the thing was done, and 

(c) the subsequent taking of action that would (had the action been taken earlier) have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission of liability in connection with the risk.""

152Duty of care issues need to be seen in context. The plaintiff and defendant were indulging in a recreational sporting activity, namely horse riding. The defendant's duty of care is to exercise reasonable care riding his horse so as not to injure others. The principal question is whether or not he knew that he was riding into a paddock where the horse Aletist was in season. There are also questions as to how the defendant responded to the danger, and whether his horse was known to him to have a bad disposition. It is for this reason that, in relation to consideration of issues of the defence, I have set out the provisions of ss 5F and 5G in relation to voluntary assumption of risk and s 5L in relation to obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity.

153Concepts of duty of care owed by participants involved in recreation or sport have been the subject of analysis in a series of decisions. An early High Court decision, Rootes v Shelton (1967) 116 CLR 383, sets out (at 385) the parameters of the duty of care owed by participants in a sport:

""By engaging in a sport or pastime the participants may be held to have accepted risks which are inherent in that sport or pastime: the tribunal of fact can make its own assessment of what the accepted risks are: but this does not eliminate all duty of care of the one participant to the other. Whether or not such a duty arises, and, if it does, its extent, must necessarily depend in each case upon its own circumstances. In this connexion, the rules of the sport or game may constitute one of those circumstances: but, in my opinion, they are neither definitive of the existence nor of the extent of the duty; nor does their breach or non-observance necessarily constitute a breach of any duty found to exist.""

154Kitto J went on to say at 389:

""It may be a moot point, as Dixon J regarded it in Insurance Commissioner v Joyce (1948) 77 CLR 39, at p 57, whether, in a negligence action, a plaintiff's voluntary acceptance of a risk should be considered as bearing upon the question whether the relation between the parties was such that the defendant owed him a duty of care, or to the question whether the standard of care which the defendant was under a duty to maintain towards the plaintiff was higher than that which in fact his conduct reached. But the issue on either view is whether the defendant's act or omission was a breach of a duty of care which he owed to the plaintiff; and accordingly in a case such as the present it must always be a question of fact, what exoneration from a duty of care otherwise incumbent upon the defendant was implied by the act of the plaintiff in joining in the activity. Unless the activity partakes of the nature of a war or of something else in which all is notoriously fair, the conclusion to be reached must necessarily depend, according to the concepts of the common law, upon the reasonableness, in relation to the special circumstances, of the conduct which caused the plaintiff's injury. That does not necessarily mean the compliance of that conduct with the rules, conventions or customs (if there are any) by which the correctness of conduct for the purpose of the carrying on of the activity as an organized affair is judged; for the tribunal of fact may think that in the situation in which the plaintiff's injury was caused a participant might do what the defendant did and still not be acting unreasonably, even though he infringed the ""rules of the game"". Non-compliance with such rules, conventions or customs (where they exist) is necessarily one consideration to be attended to upon the question of reasonableness; but it is only one, and it may be of much or little or even no weight in the circumstances.""

Breach of duty

155I have set out above the relevant extracts from ss 5B and 5C of the Act, and, at the risk of repeating myself, note once again that this is a case which has been fought on the issue of the defendant's actual knowledge, and not a claim of constructive knowledge on the part of the defendant.

156The particulars of breach of duty essentially relate to the circumstances in which the defendant allayed the plaintiff's fears or concerns about riding into the arena paddock in circumstances where both of them knew that the horse Aletist was in season. This is not a case where it is asserted that it was negligent for the defendant to ride his stallion into the arena paddock regardless of whether or not the mares in the paddock were in season; the case has been fought on the basis of the pleadings, namely that the defendant had actual knowledge of this fact.

157As Mr Lawson points out at paragraph 12 of his report, mares do not always demonstrate that they are in season unless there is a male horse around. Unless the mare is a very hormonal mare, it is easy to miss she is in season unless she is teased. In the present case, it is asserted that it was visually evident that Aletist was in season because she was ""winking"", namely releasing fluid from her vulva, which would have been visible to anyone experienced with horses.

158The other particulars of negligence relate to the circumstances in which the defendant directed the plaintiff, once he had been thrown from Wrangler to the ground, to try to grab Wrangler's rein otherwise to stop him from getting into the field where the mares were.

159The third general area of breach of duty is the material set out in particular (i), namely prior knowledge of the horse Wrangler becoming excited in the presence of other horses and in particular mares.

160In addition, if breach of duty is established, the issue of causation may arise (s 5D(1)(a)): Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem (2009) 239 CLR 420 at [54]-[55]. The breach of duty must be established to have caused the injury.

Particulars of negligence

161I now set out the evidence in relation to each of the particulars of negligence pleaded by the plaintiff

(a) Failing to properly and/or adequately control his horse Wrangler.

162The defendant's written submissions point out that the answers to particulars in relation to this claim assert that the defendant did not have proper control of Wrangler because ""Wrangler threw the defendant off him and charged at the plaintiff"" and ""the defendant should not have been riding Wrangler in the vicinity of Aletist"". This is essentially a restatement of the claim in other particulars of negligence, discussed in more detail below, to the effect that the defendant failed to have proper control over his horse. I note my findings that the plaintiff did not tell the defendant the horse Aletist was in season. 

163However, independently of whether or not the defendant should have been riding Wrangler near a horse which was in season, there is a question of how a person riding a stallion should manage that horse when it comes into contact with another horse in season. 

164Mr Sanna's evidence at T 139-140 was as follows:

""Q. If you were riding a horse and saw mares at that gate or barrier, you would attempt to turn the horse around, is that ride?
A. The stallion for sure.

Q. If the stallion attempting to cantor swiftly towards that barrier where the mares are you would attempt to turn the horse around?
A. Definitely.

Q. If I suggest to you that's what Mr Meyer did - in other words, he attempted to turn Wrangler around then your opinion would be that that was the actions of a reasonably prudent rider of a stallion?
A. Definitely.

Q. If after controlling the horse, the stallion, and being able to have the horse under control to be walking back towards the direction in which it came, walking back probably a distance of maybe 100 to 150 metres and the horse was acting - in other words the stallion was acting quietly and you as the rider had that stallion under control and you were walking back and you were returning the stallion back to its stable or the area where it is enclosed, would you consider that to be the actions of a reasonable, prudent rider of the stallion?
A. If those circumstances were the case, yes, definitely.

Q. If you got to a point 150 metres away from the area where the mares were located and the stallion unexpectedly bucked you from the horse would that be something that you would have expected to have occurred under those situations?
A. It is certainly not impossible at all. I think the fact that the horse is wanting to go that way, you'd want him to go that way until you've got him secured there is always a chance that he is going to maybe spin around, rear up, buck or try and assert himself in some ways but there is - I wouldn't discount that there is a strong chance that that could happen.

Q. Having been bucked off the horse, the stallion, the behaviour of the stallion or the manner in which Wrangler behaved - in other words, went directly back to the mares in question was predictable, is that right?
A. Yes, I would - that's what you would expect him to do, yes.

Q. And if there was a moment when the stallion was standing stationary after you'd been bucked, would you try to restrain or grab onto the stallion?
A. If you can get to your feet quick enough assuming he'd bucked you off and you're on the ground. If you can jump up and grab him that would definitely be a smart thing to do yes.""

165It was put to the defendant that he had lost control of the horse. While the defendant said that he had been thrown unexpectedly, the plaintiff submits it was not completely unexpected because of the horse's prior behaviour in trying to get to the other side of the fence with the mares (T 437).

166The defendant's response to this danger, namely to endeavour to walk the stallion back to the stable area was, as Mr Sanna pointed out at T 140, the action of a reasonably prudent rider of a stallion. The question of whether it was inadvisable for him to be riding this stallion in the vicinity of a mare in season is dealt with in other particulars set out below.

167Mr Lawson's report makes no comment on this particular. At T 150, he does however say that when riding a stallion, it is essential to be always looking for possible problems or conflicts that could arise. However, Mr Lawson does not identify any negligence by the defendant in response to the danger, such as an alternative course of conduct.

168It was put to Mr Sanna at T 156 that if Aletist was visible from about 100 metres back from the fence the defendant went through ""a red light"" by continuing to advance towards the fence when the horse was visible some 100 metres away. However, this was on the basis of the defendant knowing about Aletist being in season (T 155 lines 44-49). If, as I have found, the defendant did not know that Aletist was in season, the mere fact that he saw a horse 100 metres away would mean nothing to him. It was not suggested in the evidence that from 100 metres it was possible to see a mare ""winking"". The evidence of the defendant was that as soon as Wrangler became excited the defendant endeavoured to get him under control and to turn him around and lead him away. 

169The plaintiff has not made out this particular of negligence. 

(b) Allowing the plaintiff to ride her horse in the vicinity of Wrangler when it was not safe to do so.

170The particulars given by the plaintiff (Exhibit 3) state that the defendant allowed the plaintiff to ride her horse in the vicinity of Wrangler when it was not safe to do so in that there was a foreseeable risk Wrangler would get excited and out of control which in fact happened.

171This particular of negligence is therefore based upon the knowledge of the defendant that Aletist was in season, or could be in season, and that there was a foreseeable risk that Wrangler would become excited. 

172Mr Sanna told the court that stallions were so potentially dangerous that they are required to wear green discs at shows and events so that persons could identify them (T 154 line 15) and that children are not allowed to ride stallions because of their dangerous propensities (T 148). However, this only relates to competitions, not to private riding activities, as Mr Sanna noted in his comments about the photograph of Ms Fenner's nephew seated on Wrangler (T 148-149). What Mr Sanna had to say about that was as follows:

""Q. In a situation such as this, in a controlled environment, on a private property with a horse which is familiar with the operator being Mr Meyer there's nothing wrong with that is it under those circumstances?
A. Doesn't look like it there looking at those photos.""

173Mr Lawson, in his report (Exhibit 2), states that when working with a stallion the rider/handler is always looking for possible problems or conflicts that could arise. However, Mr Lawson said it would be unreasonable simply because Wrangler was a stallion that he should be closeted away and never permitted to interact with other horses.

174As I have found that the defendant did not know that Aletist was in season, and as there was no additional reason for the plaintiff not to ride her horse in the vicinity of Wrangler, this particular of negligence is not made out.

(c) Allowing his horse Wrangler to be close to the horse Aletist when he knew that Aletist was in season.

175The particulars (Exhibit 3) state that the defendant knew that the horse Aletist was in season because the plaintiff told him before they commenced their ride.

176For the plaintiff to succeed on this particular, she must prove that the defendant knew that Aletist was in season and/or that he knew of Wrangler's prior history of becoming excited or agitated in the presence of other horses and in particular mares. 

177I am satisfied that the defendant did not know that Aletist was in season, although the plaintiff did. In addition, I have found that there is no evidence of Wrangler having the prior history of becoming excited or agitated in the presence of other horses, especially mares.

178The defendant also draws to my attention that in the particulars for paragraph (c) there is no reference to the plaintiff informing the defendant in a telephone conversation the week before. This is a minor point, as I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not inform the defendant that Aletist was in season.

179It was the plaintiff, not the defendant, who placed the two mares in the paddock where she and the defendant took their weekly rides. The plaintiff, and not the defendant, had the responsibility for the care, control and management of the property and the horses on it. 

180In addition, the defendant did not allow his horse to ""be close"" to Aletist at the first sign of trouble. He endeavoured to control his horse and to return the stable. 

181As is set out elsewhere, there is no evidence that his decision to turn around and return to this stable was made too late, or in circumstances where he allowed the horse to become too close. This particular of negligence accordingly fails.

182The plaintiff has not made out evidence capable of supporting this particular.

(d) Allowing the plaintiff and her horse to ride together with Wrangler when he knew or should have known that Wrangler was ""fresh"" and had been fed grain recently so that Wrangler was ""pepped up"".

183The particulars provided refer to a statement to this effect by the defendant to the plaintiff. It is based on the claim that Wrangler had not been having enough exercise, as well as to the claim that the horse was ""pepped up"" by reason of his grain-feeding regime. It is a particular of negligence capable of being relied upon whether the defendant knew Aletist was in season or not.

184Mr Sanna's evidence at T 143-144 concerning Wrangler's feeding regime was as follows:

""Q. So in your comments about the manner in which - sorry, I withdraw that. In relation to the feeding regime of Wrangler, if I was to say to you that Wrangler for a period of one month before the incident was on 200 grams of what could be described as sweet feed which is molasses, lupins, sunflower, corn and soya, that wouldn't, 200 grams per day is not a large amount of corn so to speak, or sweet feed?
A. 200 grams is not excessive.

Q. It's not excessive?
A. No.

Q. It would not give rise to any heightened behaviour on behalf of the horse, the stallion?
A. It depends on the horse and it depends on the work. If a horse has a propensity to get a bit excitable then the work-to-feed ratio is relevant. If you are asking me is 200 grams is an excessive amount of feed, no I don't think it's an excessive amount of feed.""

185The defendant's evidence was that the horse Wrangler had been on a high protein diet for months. The defendant said at T 399-400:

""Q. You had fed Wrangler grain in the lead up to this event, hadn't you?
A. I fed Wrangler a high protein diet.

Q. That was to get him more energy, wasn't it?
A. To give him more energy and to build his muscle.

Q. That would tend to make him more frisky, wouldn't it?
A. I think the term you're looking for is ""hot""

Q. More hot?
A. It can do with some horses.

Q. That would make him harder to control, would it not, when you were riding him?
A. For a period of time, maybe.

Q. Particularly if he hadn't been ridden that much?
A. True.

Q. You hadn't ridden him that much, had you?
A. I hadn't ridden him for a week.

Q. Feeding somebody - a horse a high protein diet and not having exercised him for a week may suggest that there may be some difficulties with him becoming ""hot"" and having more energy due to the high protein diet, that's right, isn't it?
A. He's been on a high protein diet for months.

HER HONOUR

Q. How many months?
A. Since before the national finals, so it would have been around February.

Q. That would be most of the time he was there, wouldn't it?
A. That's correct.
JONES

Q. And most of that time he hadn't been ridden regularly?
A. No, that's not correct.

Q. He'd been ridden at the most, generally, once a week?
A. That's - that's - with regard to frequency; I would ride for hours at a time.""

186Mr Sanna said (T 144) that questions of management of the horse by an experienced person such as the defendant would largely be a matter for that person to make informed decisions about. The expert evidence does not go so far as to say Wrangler was ""fresh"" or ""pepped up"" by reason of diet or lack of exercise. 

187The defendant said that he rode Wrangler at every opportunity. There was no evidence that Wrangler needed exercise or was restive due to lack of exercise.

188This particular of negligence is not made out.

(e) Instructing the plaintiff ""don't let him get past"" after Wrangler had thrown him to the ground when it was not safe for the plaintiff to get near to Wrangler.

189According to the answers to particulars, the plaintiff relies upon the statement by the defendant that he should ""don't let him get past"" meaning Wrangler, which had just thrown the defendant to the ground, when it was not safe for the plaintiff to go near to Wrangler. This particular of negligence is independent of whether or not the defendant knew Aletist was in season and relates to his response to the danger.

190The plaintiff's evidence on this was as follows:

""Q. So the horse dips near the second little tree and Mr Meyer is thrown off, all right?
A. That's right.

Q. You are about ten or fifteen metres back?
A. That's right.

Q. You are witnessing all this, did Mr Meyer get up?
A. He began to get up and as he started to get up he shouted to me, ""Don't let him get past"".

Q. And what was Wrangler doing at this stage?
A. Wrangler, I'm not sure the horse eventually spun around because he realised I guess that Alan wasn't on him any more and the horse spun around and was charging back.

Q. When you say back, back towards what direction?
A. Back towards the two mares at the top of the track.

Q. Back towards Aletist and Butterfly?
A. That's right.

Q. Back towards that gate?
A. That's correct.

Q. The gate was still in position was it, it hadn't been moved?
A. Not to my knowledge, no.

Q. So it is charging back, Mr Meyer yells out to you, ""Don't let him pass""?
A. Right and he did that as he was starting, I saw Alan start to get up after he hit the ground and while he was still getting up, he shouted that out to me and at the same time the horse was doing its thing and had spun around and was starting to go back up.

Q. So be coming back towards your direction?
A. That's correct.

Q. What happens next?
A. I had stopped on Freckles and I was standing on the hay shed side of that white tree.

...

Q. Now can I just stop you there and say, you have been told you told the Court previously that Mr Meyer had told you not to have anything to do with Wrangler?
A. That's correct.

Q. How confident did you feel being around Wrangler at this time when he had thrown off Mr Meyer, he had told you to not let him pass and the horse is coming back towards you, how confident did you feel?
A. I wasn't confident at all.

Q. Right?
A. I was very concerned at the antics of the horse leading up to that point in time and also the antics that had led to Alan who I - he was an experienced, or is an experienced horse person and he had just been thrown off the horse in that circumstance, so I was very worried.

...

Q. You told the Court you asked Freckles to move, did Freckles move?
A. He did.

Q. Where did he move?
A. He took one step forward with his right front foot.

Q. And which direction?
A. towards the gate area.

Q. Is that towards the centre of the track?
A. Yes it is.

Q. Now why did you take that manoeuvre, why did you do that manoeuvre?
A. Because Alan had told me to.

Q. If you hadn't had been given that manoeuvre, in other words if you hadn't been told not to let Wrangler pass would you have taken that manoeuvre with your horse?
A. Absolutely not."" (T 45-47)

191The plaintiff described the next event as follows:

""Q. What happened?
A. After Wrangler had spun around he had then started charging and obviously he was coming in my general direction. As he got a bit closer towards me he snaked his head around, sorry, I can still picture it as clear as day, he moved his head around to the horse's right hand side which meant that he was lining me up directly and he tilted his head a little bit and obviously he was close to me and I could see the look on his eye and the only way I can describe it is pure fury.

Q. Is this the look on Wrangler's eye?
A. That's right. And at that point I knew exactly what was going to happen and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.

Q. What happened?
A. The horse then kept coming at the same speed and took hold of my leg, left leg above the knee.

Q. How did he take hold of it?
A. He bit it, opened his mouth and latched on like a vice, was how it felt it was the most excruciating pain I have ever felt. Kind of happened pretty fast at that point but his momentum to where he was going took me--

Q. It was towards Aletist--
A. And Butterfly, it took me and my horse in the same direction.

Q. Was he still holding onto your leg?
A. Yes he was.

Q. Left leg with his mouth?
A. Absolutely.

Q. Did you feel any pain at that stage?
A. It was the most excruciating pain I had ever felt, and I began screaming probably at the top of my lungs, I remember thinking, it was a very loud scream, but it just an instinctive response.
Q. Were you still in the saddle at this stage?
A. Yes I was and I still had my - I hadn't changed my position in the saddle."" (T 48-49)

192It is clear from this description that the plaintiff's horse would have at best taken only a step in the path of Wrangler. The plaintiff in cross-examination said at T 228-229:

""Q. You didn't actually move Freckles at all did you, you only squeezed him?
A. I squeezed Freckles and he took one step forward with his right front foot and that was it.

Q. Didn't move physically across the pathway in any way. Just put a foot forward. Is that it?
A. Well I must admit I wasn't looking to see if that step forward had actually meant his body had gone forward but he certainly only took one step forward with one foot.

Q. So you are not sure whether you actually moved forward at all are you?
A. No.

Q. You could have quite easily just remained stationary without actually physically moving your body?
A. Sorry can you please say that again?

Q. You could have quite easily just remained stationary yourself, in other words not, just yourself personally?
A. I think it would be unusual but perhaps it's possible. I can only tell you that he took that step forward and that I imagine there would have been some shoulder and body movement of the horse--

...

Q. So therefore you're in that position or Freckles was in that position as a result of and before Mr - sorry, I withdraw that. You were in that position across the pathway before Mr Meyer said anything to you weren't you?

OBJECTION. 

Q. When Freckles was in the position across the pathway, that was before Mr Meyer called out wasn't it? You didn't manoeuvre--
A. Yes.

Q. Yes it was before that?
A. That's correct.""

193Looking at the photographs which have been tendered and having regard to the evidence about the width of the pathway, it appears that it was possible for Wrangler to have passed the plaintiff whatever action she took. It is also most likely that the plaintiff had so little time to move that if Wrangler had decided to attack her, there was little she could do. However, far apart the horses were, it was not a distance that would represent any difficulty to a stallion to cover in a matter of seconds.

194The manoeuvre which the plaintiff asserts was dangerous was not considered to be dangerous by the expert Mr Sanna, depending upon how quickly the horse could be controlled. He said at T 140-141, concerning the desirability of either the plaintiff or the defendant trying to grab the horse Wrangler:

""Q. Having been bucked off the horse, the stallion, the behaviour of the stallion or the manner in which Wrangler behaved - in other words, went directly back to the mares in question was predictable, is that right?
A. Yes, I would - that's what you would expect him to do, yes.

Q. And if there was a moment when the stallion was standing stationary after you'd been bucked, would you try to restrain or grab onto the stallion?
A. If you can get to your feet quick enough assuming he'd bucked you off and you're on the ground. If you can jump up and grab him that would definitely be a smart thing to do yes.

Q. And if there was another person, experienced rider with 31 years experience, riding with you, would you expect that that person may assist in some way in holding the stallion?
A. I think if you're on another horse that's probably a slightly different proposition because there is a chance that the, it depends on how those two horses interact, that there is a chance that the stallion would behave aggressively towards another horse. Most horses, if they face up to a - most stallions if they face up to another horse and they're physically very close and they can sniff at them, they're very likely to scream and paw and maybe strike or rear at the other horse, so it would be a considerably more dangerous procedure to try and do it off another horse.

Q. If the other horse was, which is Freckles in this situation, a gelding which had been riding and familiar with riding with Wrangler basis probably once every fortnight over the period of ten months prior, would you consider that an experience rider, someone with 31 years experience and with experience of riding Freckles, would be appropriate to maybe try to hold onto--
A. If the horses have a history of interacting well, stallions normally can differentiate a mare from a gelding and they're much comfortable, they're much less likely to get excitable about a gelding being near them, then I don't disagree with what you are saying. Provided it is not on the move, you know, if it's stationary and you can get a hold of it for a moment, then the rider can jump up and grab it, then I think it's probably quite appropriate. If the thing's already on the move and got, it's sort of got a clear direction and he's sort of on the run, then I think it would be, it would be dangerous to try and attempt that manoeuvre.

Q. But in that momentary situation whereby you've been thrown from this stallion, the horse is standing there and there's that other person with the experience I outlined, on a horse such as Freckles, before the horse started to move, in other words before the stallion started to move, it was a reasonable reaction to attempt to restrain the stallion?
A. Yes I wouldn't disagree with that.

Q. You would not disagree?
A. No.

Q. And for you to say something like ""hold him"" or something like that, to that person who's on that gelding such as Freckles, in that split second when he's stationary, would be a reasonable thing in your view?
A. If they were close. If they, you know, I think if they were right here then yes I think that would be a reasonable thing to do. As I say, if there was any distance and they have to gallop up to the horse or if the horse had turned around started to gallop, then to try and grab a hold of it then would be, would be a very different proposition I think.""

195The events in question occurred within seconds. The defendant denies that he said ""don't let him get past"", and says he said ""hold him"", but they amount to much the same thing. The difficulty is that, whatever the plaintiff did, she did not have time to react, and her horse in fact barely moved. Wrangler was already on the way, as the expert evidence makes clear.

196Mr Sanna in his report of 6 December 2010 comments that the events which led to the plaintiff's injuries were 

""really a random series of actions resulting from the defendant losing control of his horse, as he was trying to extricate himself and the horse from a situation he had come to realise was very dangerous. Unfortunately the horse had become over excited at being confronted (albeit on the other side of a very flimsy wire fence) by a couple of mares, one of which at least was posturing towards him.

The defendant's fall from the horse, the resulting attack on the plaintiff by the now loose and excited stallion were all foreseeable if unfortunate consequences of the initial poor decision to take the stallion into that situation."" (report 6 December 2010, Exhibit H)

197Mr Sanna concludes that whether the plaintiff responded to an instruction to block the stallion or was ""merely in the path between the loose stallion and the mares in the paddock"" was probably irrelevant (report 29 June 2011, Exhibit H).

198In practical terms, the defendant's instruction to the plaintiff made no difference. She had no time to move out of the way and there was nothing that the defendant could do or say to help her. The accident was about to happen by reason of the fact that the plaintiff and defendant had ridden towards the paddock into which the plaintiff had put a mare in season.

199Mr Chant expressed some opinions about the defendant's course of action, in his cross-examination by counsel for the plaintiff. He is a lay person who was not present at the time. He agreed that it was the direction that he would have been unlikely to give (T 480) but he said that if the horse was closer than 15 metres away it would be an acceptable direction to give (T 484), particularly if the person to whom the direction was given was familiar with the horse (T 485). This evidence does not take the matter much further.

200Regardless of my findings as to whether or not the defendant knew that Aletist was in season, the defendant's conduct in saying either ""don't let him get pass"" or ""hold him"" was not negligent. If I have erred in this finding, there is a causation problem. As Mr Sanna points out, the circumstances leading to the plaintiff's injuries were a random series of actions and furthermore the plaintiff had no time to act upon any negligent instructions by the defendant. The horse was charging towards her and her own horse had only been able to take one step. The accident was going to happen regardless of what the plaintiff and defendant did. Accordingly, this particular has not been made out.

(f) Failing to direct the plaintiff to immediately leave the area after Wrangler started to become excited.

201These amount to particulars that the defendant failed to take reasonable care for the safety for the plaintiff by telling her to go somewhere safe as soon as Wrangler became excited. 

202As is set out above, the evidence of Mr Sanna was that it was not unreasonable for the defendant to endeavour to control his horse and to commence riding back to the stables and to terminate the ride. He did so in the company of the plaintiff and was effectively directing her to leave the area. The key difference seems to be the word ""immediately"", in that it appears to be submitted that he should have directed the plaintiff to gallop away while he remained behind to get control of his horse. 

203The evidence of both the plaintiff and defendant was that the defendant was initially able to get Wrangler under control and start to lead him back to the stable. In addition, the evidence is that as soon as Wrangler began to misbehave, the defendant did in fact turn the horse around.

204The defendant's evidence was that he gave her the opportunity to continue riding without him, to allow him to return to the stable area with Wrangler, and that she declined. There is no evidence that there was sufficient time for the horses to travel in different directions in any event.

205The plaintiff has not made out evidence to support this particular.

(g) Failing to direct the plaintiff to immediately leave the area after Wrangler had thrown the defendant to the ground.

206Once the defendant had been thrown to the ground, it was a matter of seconds before the plaintiff was attacked by Wrangler. The plaintiff's horse took one step forward, on her evidence, and she was then attacked by Wrangler.

207For the reasons set out in relation to particular (f) above, the plaintiff has not made out evidence to support this particular. I also note reliance of the defendant in relation to s 5H of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) in relation to any duty to warn of obvious risk.

(h) Failing to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff.

208The defendant refers me to the request for further and better particulars, where the plaintiff asserts that the failure to take reasonable care for the safety of the plaintiff is ""not directing her to go to a safe area"", the same as the particulars for paragraphs (f) and (g). The defendant submits that this does not take the plaintiff's case any further. 

209There are a number of matters which could be relied to by the plaintiff which are not contained in the particulars. These include the submission that the defendant was putting his horse's welfare ahead of the welfare of the plaintiff (plaintiff's written submissions, paragraph 133), the circumstances in which he left the plaintiff lying on the ground in circumstances where she had to drag herself under a fence (written submissions, paragraph 135) and losing control of Wrangler (written submissions, paragraph 107-109). 

210All of the evidence points to both the plaintiff and defendant endeavouring to get away from the paddock where Aletist was. Even if the defendant had known that Aletist was in season, the speed with which Wrangler reacted and, as a powerful stallion, escaped the control of the defendant by throwing him and charging towards the plaintiff, was such that the accident was, as both experts point out, inevitable. There is no evidence, expert or otherwise, to support the contention that the defendant could have directed the plaintiff to go to a safe area. The provisions of s 5H are also of relevance; as soon as Wrangler became excited, the plaintiff, an experienced horsewoman, should have known of the danger and not require warning by the defendant. In relation to leaving the plaintiff on the ground, the defendant had no alternative as he had to call an ambulance.

211Further, the parties should be held to the case that they plead and particularise, and if the case as particularised in relation to particular (h) is ""not directing her to go to a safe area"" it is not appropriate for me to speculate as to what other material may be derived from the evidence in support of this particular. I note that the plaintiff's written submissions do not identify specific matters going to this particular of negligence.

(i) Approaching, or continuing to approach, Aletist, knowing that Wrangler had previously become excited/agitated in the presence of other horses and in particular mares.

212The evidence relied upon according to the particulars provided by the plaintiff are the three prior incidents in 2006 - 2007 where Wrangler is asserted to have behaved in a manner indicating he became excited or agitated in the presence of other horses. As set out at [107] - [112], I have not accepted this evidence.

213There is no evidence that the plaintiff and defendant continued to approach Aletist after Wrangler began to become excited or agitated. The evidence is that as soon as this occurred, the defendant attempted to get him under control and to turn him around.

214As I have rejected the evidence of the prior three occasions in relation to Wrangler, and I am satisfied that the plaintiff and defendant did not continue to approach Aletist after Wrangler began to become excited or agitated, the plaintiff has failed to make out evidence to support this particular. 

215The plaintiff has failed in relation to the findings of fact that I have made in relation to each of the particulars of negligence (a) - (i). However, in relation to each of the particulars of negligence, the defendant additionally relies upon defences under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). Both the issue of liability for harm from obvious risks of dangerous recreational activities (s 5L) and voluntary assumption of risk (ss 5F and 5G) may apply to certain of the particulars whether or not the plaintiff and defendant had the conversations deposed to by the plaintiff about Aletist being in season. The relationship between the plaintiff and defendant is, I have found, a relationship of persons who were living in some form of de facto relationship, not teacher/pupil, or occupier/licensee. They were both horse lovers and, while the defendant was more experienced than the plaintiff, the plaintiff still had considerable knowledge. In particular, both plaintiff and defendant were engaging in a recreational activity, horse riding, which was dangerous, and the question of whether or not both knew of the danger is relevant to the defence of volenti. It is to a consideration of these defences that I now turn.

Liability for harm from obvious risks of dangerous recreational activities

216Section 5L Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) provides:

""5L No liability for harm suffered from obvious risks of dangerous recreational activities

(1) A person (""the defendant"") is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person (""the plaintiff"") as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff.

(2) This section applies whether or not the plaintiff was aware of the risk.""

217Section 5F defines ""obvious risk"" as follows:

""5F Meaning of ""obvious risk"" 
(1) For the purposes of this Division, an ""obvious risk"" to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person. 
(2) Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge. 
(3) A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring. 
(4) A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable.""

218Section 5G provides as follows:

""5G Injured persons presumed to be aware of obvious risks 
(1) In determining liability for negligence, a person who suffers harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm if it was an obvious risk, unless the person proves on the balance of probabilities that he or she was not aware of the risk. 
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person is aware of a risk if the person is aware of the type or kind of risk, even if the person is not aware of the precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence of the risk.""

219As noted in my discussion of the defence of volenti, neither of ss 5F and 5G are referred to in the defence. In written submissions (at paragraph 203) and oral submissions, counsel for the plaintiff submits that as s 5G is not pleaded against the plaintiff, this means that this defence must fail, on the basis that the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) covers the field and the failure to plead s 5G is fatal. I have dealt with this issue in more detail below.

220The question of what amounts to ""obvious risk"" is explained in Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (2005) 221 CLR 234 at [36]-[37] as follows:

""[36] The obviousness of a risk, and the remoteness of the likelihood that other people will fail to observe and avoid it, are often factors relevant to a judgment about what reasonableness requires as a response. In the case of some risks, reasonableness may require no response. There are, for instance, no risk-free dwelling houses. The community's standards of reasonable behaviour do not require householders to eliminate all risks from their premises, or to place a notice at the front door warning entrants of all the dangers that await them if they fail to take care for their own safety. This is not a case about warnings. Even so, it may be noted that a conclusion, in a given case, that a warning is either necessary or sufficient, itself involves an assumption that those to whom the warning is addressed will take notice of it and will exercise care. The whole idea of warnings is that those who receive them will act carefully. There would be no purpose in issuing warnings unless it were reasonable to expect that people will modify their behaviour in response to warnings.

[37] The factual judgment involved in a decision about what is reasonably to be expected of a person who owes a duty of care to another involves an interplay of considerations. The weight to be given to any one of them is likely to vary according to circumstances. If the obviousness of a risk, and the reasonableness of an expectation that other people will take care for their own safety, were conclusive against liability in every case, there would be little room for a doctrine of contributory negligence. On the other hand, if those considerations were irrelevant, community standards of reasonable behaviour would require radical alteration.""

221The defendant also draws my attention to an early statement by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Wyong Shire Council v Vairy; Mulligan v Coffs Harbour City Council (2004) Aust Torts Reports 81-754 at [161] as follows:

""[161] At this point it is appropriate to comment that, according to my research, none of the Australian cases attempt to define what is meant, at least generally, by an obvious risk. This is not to say that the authorities referred to above are inconsistent in approaching the question of whether a risk is, in fact, obvious in a given circumstance. However, I see no reason not to adopt the definition found in the commentary to §343A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) (Rest 2d Torts §343A). This definition is consistent with the Australian authorities discussed above which have emphasised the importance of an individual taking care for his or her own safety. In the commentary, ""obvious"" is defined as follows:

'Obvious' means that both the condition and the risk are apparent to and would be recognized by a reasonable man, in the position of the [plaintiff], exercising ordinary perception, intelligence, and judgment.""

222In Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council [2007] NSWCA 4 McClellan CJ at CL explained the interaction of ss 5F and 5G in relation to the meaning of obvious risk and the circumstances in which a person was presumed to be aware as follows:

""[90] The effect of these provisions is that a plaintiff is rebuttably presumed to be aware of a risk where the risk would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff. A plaintiff cannot rebut the presumption by claiming that even though he or she was aware of the general risk of harm, he or she was not aware of all its possible manifestations, including the one that eventuated.""

Voluntary assumption of risk

223At paragraph 38 of the defence, a defence of volenti non fit injuria is pleaded in terms of a defence at common law only:

""The defendant relies upon the defence of volenti non fit injuria for the reasons outlined at paragraphs 13 to 33 above, as a total defence to the plaintiff's claim.""

224The interaction between the common law defence of voluntary assumption of risk and ss 5F and 5G was explained by McClellan CJ at CL in Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council were cited with approval in Angel v Hawkesbury City Council (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-955 at [83] as follows:

""[83] A finding that a risk of harm is an ""obvious risk"" within the meaning of s 5F(1) so that pursuant to s 5G(1) the person who suffers harm is presumed to be aware of that risk, does not, as the Council would have it, automatically lead to a finding of no breach of duty. Sections 5F and 5G are contained in Div 4 of Pt 1A of the CL Act entitled ""Assumption of risk"". The purpose of that Division is, at least in part, to make it easier for a defendant to establish the common law defence of voluntary assumption of risk or volenti: C G Maloney Pty Ltd v Hutton-Potts [2006] NSWCA 136 at [101] per Santow JA; Carey at [34]. Except with respect to an ""obvious risk"" which obviates any common law duty to warn (see s 5H), the provisions of ss 5F and 5G and, in particular, the statutory definition of an ""obvious risk"", have no relevance to the question of breach of duty.""

225The same issues relevant to ""obvious risk"" relating to a dangerous recreational activity for the purpose of s 5L also apply to the defences at common law of voluntary assumption of risk, as glossed by ss 5F and 5G.

226Further assistance in the relationship between the common law defence, which was always a difficult defence to prove, and the provisions of ss 5F and 5G, has been provided by McClellan CJ at CL in Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council at [86]:

""[86] Until the recent statutory amendments provided by the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) a defendant faced a difficult task to prove volenti. Although a plaintiff may be aware of a risk that they might be injured, unless the defendant could prove that they appreciated the risk that they might be injured in a particular manner or to a particular extent the defence would fail. As Lord Halsbury LC said in Smith v Charles Baker & Sons [1891] AC 325 at 336, ""a person who relies on the maxim must shew a consent to the particular thing done."" Indeed, the defence has been so stringently applied that Campbell J noted in Tingle v J B Hinz & Sons [1970] Qd R 108 at 113 that:

Glanville Williams in Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence at p 307 says that in almost every negligence action of modern times where the defence has been raised it has failed. Fleming in his work on Torts (3rd ed) at p 259, predicts that the defence will disappear eventually into the limbo of forgotten things.""

227The plaintiff challenged first the entitlement to plead the defence at all, and then the entitlement to rely upon ss 5F and 5G. The defendant submits that if the defence were to fail in the form it is pleaded, namely at common law, then it is with the assistance of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) that the defence of volenti must be construed, referring to McClellan CJ at CL's comments at [87] and [88] of Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council:

""[87] Division 4 of Pt 1A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) - particularly ss 5F and 5G - was designed to address this issue. The second reading speech to the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Bill refers to the Ipp Report, which at p 129 indicates that the intention of Div 4 was ""to encourage greater use by the courts of the defence of assumption of risk."" It was noted in the Report that:

The more narrowly a risk is defined, the less likely it is that a person will have been aware of it. For instance, a person may be aware of the risk of suffering bodily injury as a result of engaging in a particular activity. But the person may not be aware of the risk of suffering bodily injury in a particular way.

[88] Accordingly, the Report recommended the enactment of the following provisions:

· A provision to the effect that for the purposes of the defence of assumption of risk, it would be presumed that the person against whom the defence is pleaded was actually aware of an obvious risk unless that person could prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she was not aware of the risk (para 8.30);

· A provision to the effect that for the purposes of the defence of assumption of risk, the test of whether a person was aware of a risk is whether he or she was aware of a risk of the type or kind of risk and not of its precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence (para 8.31).""

228The defendant submits (written submissions, paragraph 341) that if the defence fails at common law then ss 5F and 5G would overcome the difficulties of the common law defence.

229What are the consequences of the defendant's failure to refer to ss 5F to 5I, and in particular to fail to plead s 5G?

230In fact, ss 5H and 5I are pleaded (paragraphs 39 to 41 of the defence) as follows:

""39. The Defendant relies upon Part 1A, Division 4, Section 5H of the Civil Liability Act (2002):-

a) The Defendant relies upon the facts and particulars pleaded in paragraphs 13 to 33 above.

b) The Plaintiff riding in the manner so described was an ""obvious risk"" to the Plaintiff in that, in the circumstances, it would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of the Plaintiff that there was risk of ""Wrangler"" acting in the manner so described.

c) The Plaintiff riding in the manner so described was a risk that was patent or a matter of common knowledge.

d) In the circumstances as outlined in paragraphs 13 to 31 above the Plaintiff was aware of the risk of ""Wrangler"" acting in the manner so described, or in a manner which would give rise to a risk of the type or kind of risk which occurred.

e) Under the above circumstances, pursuant to Section 5H of the Civil Liability Act, the Defendant did not owe a duty of care to the Plaintiff to warn of the risk to the plaintiff.

40. The Defendant relies upon Part 1A, Division 4, Section 5I of the Civil Liability Act (2002):-

a) The Defendant relies upon the facts and particulars pleaded in paragraphs 13 to 33 above.

b) In the circumstances as outlined above the risk of ""Wrangler"" acting in the manner so described, or in a manner which would give rise to a risk of the type or kind of risk which occurred, was an ""inherent risk"" in that it was something occurring that could not have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care and skill.

c) Under the above circumstances, pursuant to Section 5I of the Civil Liability Act, the Defendant is not liable in negligence for the harm suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the materialisation of an inherent risk.

41. The Defendant relies upon Part 1A, Division 4, Section 5I [sic] of the Civil Liability Act (2002):-

a) The Defendant relies upon the facts and particulars pleaded in paragraphs 13 to 33 above.

b) In the circumstances as outlined above the harm occasioned by the Plaintiff resulted from a recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff.

c) In the circumstances as outlined above, the activity engaged in by the Plaintiff of horse riding was a recreational activity in that it was a sport, and / or in the alternative a pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure, and / or in the alternative an activity engaged in at a place where people ordinarily engage in sport, and / or in the alternative a pursuit or activity for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure.

d) In the circumstances as outlined above, the activity engaged in by the Plaintiff of horse riding was a ""dangerous recreational activity"" in that it was a recreational activity that involved a significant risk of physical harm.

e) The Plaintiff riding in the manner so described was an ""obvious risk"" to the Plaintiff in that, in the circumstances, it would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of the Plaintiff that there was risk of ""Wrangler"" acting in the manner so described.

f) The Plaintiff riding in the manner so described was a risk that was patent or a matter of common knowledge.

g) In the circumstances as outlined in paragraphs 13 to 31 above the Plaintiff was aware of the risk of ""Wrangler"" acting in the manner so described, or in a manner which would give rise to a risk of the type or kind of risk which occurred.

h) Under the above circumstances, pursuant to Section 5L of the Civil Liability Act, the Defendant is not liable in negligence for the harm suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the materialisation of the obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the Plaintiff."" 

231For the plaintiff's argument to succeed, one or both of the following arguments must succeed:

(a)No plea of volenti is possible because the common law defence has been ""superseded"" by ss 5F to 5I, which ""cover the field"". This was put to me in the course of oral submissions, but in further written submissions of the plaintiff (4 April 2012) the plaintiff appears to have retreated from this position. 

However, any submission that the Act ""covers the field"", particularly in relation to the defence of volenti, is misconceived. As Judd J in Woodcroft-Brown v Timbercorp Securities Ltd (in liq) [2011] VSC 427 explains at [129], the tortious defence of volenti has been modified by the Civil Liability Act, not replaced. 

The interaction between the Civil Liability Act and the common law is helpfully explained by Joachim Dietrich, ""Papers from the Tort Law Academic Workshop: Teaching torts in the age of statutes and globalisation"" (2010) 18 TLJ 141 as follows:

""Some parts of the Civil Liability Acts codify and change aspects of the common law of negligence. That is the case with the sections that state the general principles applicable to determining breach of duty (eg, Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) s 5B). In effect, these sections 'tinker' with the common law test for breach of duty. They restate the threshold test of breach, as well as the calculus of negligence factors to be considered in determining whether, ultimately, there is a breach, in slightly different terms to those of the common law principle contained in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt...

Since the Civil Liability Acts displace the common law in some of its field of operation, but do not cover the field, one particular challenge may be to determine where precisely only the common law principles apply, where only the statutory provisions apply, and where both still potentially apply, as well as where other, specific legislation applies.

Some parts of the Civil Liability Acts may merely provide a gloss or modification of common law principles that have ongoing application and relevance. Hence, s 5G of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) makes it easier to establish one element of the defence of voluntary assumption of risk, which continues to operate as a common law-based defence"".

(b)The obligation of the defendant to plead s 5G has not been complied with and he should not be permitted to rely upon a statutory defence which has not been pleaded. In other words, the defendant can rely upon a volenti defence, but only at common law, and not upon the statutory provisions which modify it, because s 5G is not referred to in the defence. This submission has been further developed by the plaintiff in the written submissions provided in accordance with orders made on 3 April 2012. Mr Jones draws my attention to the well known statement in Dare v Pulham (1982) 148 CLR 658 at [6]. That decision is, however, generally relied upon as supporting the entitlement to late amendment, rather than preventing it. 

The obligations of parties to plead their case in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) was considered by Santow JA in CG Maloney Pty Ltd v Hutton-Potts [2006] NSWCA 136 at [101]-[102] said:
""[101] The statutory consequences in ss 5G and 5H, where an obvious risk is found, operate in aid of the general law in two respects:

(a) in assisting the common law defence of voluntary assumption of risk, by introducing a rebuttable presumption of awareness of the relevant risk (""volenti""), and

(b) in obviating any common law duty of care to warn of an obvious risk to the plaintiff (with limited exceptions not relevant here).

[102] Thus there can be no need to warn of a risk one is presumed to know (s 5G) nor any proactive duty to warn of an obvious risk (s 5H). But liability for negligence is not coterminous with situations calling for warning. A warning may be insufficient to discharge the duty of care or may even be irrelevant to its discharge, depending on the circumstances.""
The plaintiff submits that the defendant cannot rely upon s 5G as he has not specifically pleaded this in his defence, and otherwise relies upon submissions already made in relation to the defence of volenti. In other words, what the plaintiff submits is that by reason of not having pleaded s 5G specifically in the pleading, the defendant is entitled to rely upon the defence of volenti as pleaded, but is restricted to the common law defence, and is not entitled to take advantage of the liberalising of the volenti test set out in s 5G.There is no doubt that the defendant has pleaded a defence of volenti, and the failure to specifically refer to s 5G is an oversight.In Bellingen Shire Council v Colavon Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 34, a s 43A Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) defence was not pleaded at all at the trial, and was raised only on appeal. Beazley JA said at [23] that any statutory provision providing a complete, even if defeasible, defence to a claim, if not pleaded, would take a party by surprise, and that any such defence is required to be pleaded: r 14.14(2)(a) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). This is because the defence, if successful, would render the plaintiff's claim not maintainable (r 14.14(2)(b)). The s 43A defence therefore failed to comply with the pleading rules. However, Beazley JA went on to note at [24]:

""[24] A failure to comply with the rules of court, including the pleading rules, is not necessarily fatal to a party's right to rely upon the unpleaded matter. The court has power to dispense with its rules: see the Civil Procedure Act 2005, s 14. It has also been long accepted that a party may litigate an issue notwithstanding a failure to comply with a pleading rule. However, the entitlement of a party to do so is dependent upon a favourable exercise of the court's discretion if objection is taken by the opposing party. The exercise of the discretion is predicated upon fairness to the parties.""

In Bellingen Shire Council v Colavon Pty Ltd, the total failure to plead or particularise the defence led to prejudice. In the present case, no prejudice is identified; the defence is pleaded, but has not been pleaded with reference to the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). Similarly, in Vertzayias v King [2011] NSWCA 215, an application to reopen the judgment to plead a defence failed; the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the trial judge's refusal to reopen the proceedings.Both these decisions relate to defences raised after the trial was over. In Sydney South West Area Health Service v MD (2009) 260 ALR 702, a defendant sought leave to amend its defence during the trial to include reference to s 5O Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), which provides the standard of care for professionals. The trial judge refused, holding that s 5O had to be specifically pleaded, by reason of r 14.14 UCPR. Hodgson JA (Allsop P and Sackville AJA concurring) held that s 5O of the defence provides a defence not available at common law with the onus of proof lying on the defendant such that r 14.14 UCPR required that the material facts contemplated by s 5O should be pleaded and, although not mandatory, specific reference to s 5O is desirable (at [19]-[25], [50]-[51] and [58]). The trial judge had erred in refusing the appellants leave to amend to specifically plead s 5O in circumstances where objection to the failure to plead was not raised until very near the end of the case which amounted to trial by ambush (at [26]-[31], [53]-[56] and [58]).Allsop P at [51] considered that s 5O Civil Liability Act did not need to be pleaded, in that it was not just a matter of evidence, but a transfer of the onus of proof. That is not the case here. Something more is involved, in that these are sections which assist the defendant to discharge its burden of proof. I am satisfied that in pleading a defence of volenti, it is appropriate that a party should identify the facts and matters relied upon for a s 5G defence but that an application for leave to amend to plead s 5G, in circumstances where it reflects the way that the case was fought at trial, as well as being the basis of the submissions in relation to the volenti defence, would have to be granted. 

Accordingly, I propose to allow the defendant to put his case on volenti in relation to the provisions of s 5G. In the event that I have erred, I have considered the defence both at common law and pursuant to ss 5F and 5G.

232I shall first consider whether the defence would have succeeded at common law.

233In Dr Bodel's report he notes that the plaintiff expressed concern to him about going on these horse rides, as she knew that Aletist was in season; she told him that ""this may be a potentially hazardous undertaking"". The plaintiff was aware that horse riding could be hazardous. She had suffered injuries in the past from falls from a horse, as had the defendant.

234Counsel for the plaintiff in written submissions puts to me that, at common law, the defendant can only succeed if there is a finding that the plaintiff freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge of the nature and extent of the risk, agreed to incur it (Ranieri v Ranieri (1973) 7 SASR 418; Osborne v London and North-Western Railway Company (1888) 21 QBD 220; Insurance Commissioner v Joyce (1948) 77 CLR 39). The plaintiff submits that there is ""simply no evidence"" (written submissions, paragraph 206) capable of satisfying the court if I accept that the plaintiff had been assured by the defendant that despite the risk it would be ""fine"" (T 27) for them to ride into a paddock notwithstanding the fact that the defendant was riding a stallion and one of the mares was known by him to be in season.

235The test has been more recently considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In Canterbury Municipal Council v Taylor [2002] NSWCA 24 Ipp AJA said at [145]-[147]:

""[145] As Burt CJ said in Jeffries v Fisher (at 253):

""Of course in many cases that appreciation and acceptance [of the risk] can readily be inferred from knowledge, but the point to be made is that knowledge alone is insufficient ...""

[146] It does not follow merely from the fact that the respondent appreciated or should have appreciated the dangers of simultaneous dual use that he believed that the touch football players would carelessly walk into the cyclists' path. He may well have believed that the footballers were quite capable of acting without negligence and would play their game in safety. These issues were not properly investigated at the trial. What evidence there was on this issue tends to support a finding that the respondent did not expect that the risk would materialise.

[147] A belief that the dangers (of which the respondent had full appreciation) would not materialise, would negative the proposition that he accepted those dangers: cf O'Shea v The Permanent Trustee Co of New South Wales Ltd (1971) Qld R1; Suncorp Insurance and Finance v Blakeney; State Government Insurance Co v Hitchcock (unreported, Full Court, Supreme Court of Western Australia, delivered 11 March 1997).""

236Counsel for the defendant points out that McClellan CJ at CL in Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council at [83]-[84] noted that this passage was open to misinterpretation:

""[83] This passage is open to misinterpretation. In a recent article (""Personal responsibility and the 'new' volenti"" (2005) 13 Tort L Rev 76), Associate Professor Lunney refers to Canterbury Municipal Council and says (at 86):

In this case, Ipp AJA held that a belief by the plaintiff that the dangers would not materialise would negative the proposition that the dangers had been accepted. Taken literally, this would require the plaintiff to expect injury as a result of the conduct. It is difficult to imagine any plaintiff testifying that they expected to be injured as a result of his conduct. Rather, the question is whether the plaintiff accepted the risk of injury.

[84] Lunney's conclusion is correct but his analysis of Canterbury Municipal Council may not be. There is a very real difference between the proposition (which Ipp AJA advanced) that a belief that a risk will not materialise will negative consent to the risk, and the proposition (which Lunney attributes to his Honour) that consent can only be inferred where the plaintiff believed that a risk would materialise. All that must be proved is that the plaintiff voluntarily accepted a chance that a perceived and fully appreciated risk would materialise. A genuine belief that the risk would not materialise will negative the defence, but a positive belief that the risk would materialise is not required to make the defence out.""

237In other words, even if a plaintiff perceived and full appreciated the risk, the defence cannot be made out unless the plaintiff had ""a genuine belief that the risk would not materialise"" (at [82]). McClellan CJ at CL referred to the failure of a defence of volenti in Suncorp Insurance & Finance v Blakeney (1993) 18 MVR 361 where a passenger who got into a car with a driver that the plaintiff knew to be a drunk had not voluntarily assumed a risk because the plaintiff had thought, notwithstanding the driver being drunk, that he still ""seemed alright"". 

238If I have erred in my finding as to the conversations on the day in question, the plaintiff was however sufficiently aware of the risk, according to her evidence, for her to query whether it was safe to ride into a paddock which contained a mare in season. She had a discussion of the briefest nature on the day of the accident. This was not a discussion of reliance; it was a casual remark that was made as they were heading out the stable door. The defendant was already on his horse and the plaintiff was in the process of finishing her saddling up. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the plaintiff and defendant, if I accept the plaintiff's description of the conversation, had a discussion about risk, and mutually agreed that they should still go riding. This is insufficient to establish the defence at common law. However, if the plaintiff and defendant had no such conversation, and they merely agreed to go for a horse ride, in circumstances where the plaintiff did not tell the defendant Aletist was in season, the plaintiff must be taken to have accepted the risk and the common law defence would succeed. This brings me to a consideration of the statutory defence.

239In relation to the statutory extension of the volenti defence, I note the statements by McClellan CJ at CL in Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-874 at [86]-[88] as follows:

""[86] Until the recent statutory amendments provided by the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) a defendant faced a difficult task to prove volenti. Although a plaintiff may be aware of a risk that they might be injured, unless the defendant could prove that they appreciated the risk that they might be injured in a particular manner or to a particular extent the defence would fail. As Lord Halsbury LC said in Smith v Charles Baker & Sons [1891] AC 325 at 336, ""a person who relies on the maxim must shew a consent to the particular thing done."" Indeed, the defence has been so stringently applied that Campbell J noted in Tingle v J B Hinz & Sons [1970] Qd R 108 at 113 that:

Glanville Williams in Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence at p 307 says that in almost every negligence action of modern times where the defence has been raised it has failed. Fleming in his work on Torts (3rd ed) at p 259, predicts that the defence will disappear eventually into the limbo of forgotten things.

[87] Division 4 of Pt 1A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) - particularly ss 5F and 5G - was designed to address this issue. The second reading speech to the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Bill refers to the Ipp Report, which at p 129 indicates that the intention of Div 4 was ""to encourage greater use by the courts of the defence of assumption of risk."" It was noted in the Report that:

The more narrowly a risk is defined, the less likely it is that a person will have been aware of it. For instance, a person may be aware of the risk of suffering bodily injury as a result of engaging in a particular activity. But the person may not be aware of the risk of suffering bodily injury in a particular way.

[88] Accordingly, the Report recommended the enactment of the following provisions:

A provision to the effect that for the purposes of the defence of assumption of risk, it would be presumed that the person against whom the defence is pleaded was actually aware of an obvious risk unless that person could prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she was not aware of the risk (para 8.30);

A provision to the effect that for the purposes of the defence of assumption of risk, the test of whether a person was aware of a risk is whether he or she was aware of a risk of the type or kind of risk and not of its precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence (para 8.31).""

240Whether the plaintiff told the defendant Aletist was in season or not, she was an experienced horsewoman; she was sufficiently aware of the specific dangers to raise them with the defendant. She was aware of the type or kind of risk, even if she was not aware of its precise nature, extent or manner of occurrence. She knew that stallions were dangerous and that this particular stallion was ""nippy"". She had previously been thrown from a horse and suffered an injury. She knew that horses could be dangerous. She knew that horses suffered injuries and attacked each other in relation to being in season, as she had owned a stallion who had been injured in the course of attempting to mate with a mare. All of these matters make it clear that the plaintiff was well aware of the risks of horse riding and in particular of the risk of riding into a paddock containing a mare which she not only knew to be in season but which she had placed there herself without prior consultation with the defendant.

241I am satisfied, in relation to the statutory defence, that the elements necessary for the statutory defence to be made out have been established by the defendant.

Alleged admissions by the defendant

242Section 69 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) provides:

""69 Effect of apology on liability 

(1) An apology made by or on behalf of a person in connection with any matter alleged to have been caused by the person: 

(a) does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability by the person in connection with that matter, and 

(b) is not relevant to the determination of fault or liability in connection with that matter. 

(2) Evidence of an apology made by or on behalf of a person in connection with any matter alleged to have been caused by the person is not admissible in any civil proceedings as evidence of the fault or liability of the person in connection with that matter.""

243Evidence was given by both the plaintiff and her mother as to admissions from the defendant to the effect that it was all his fault. The defendant submits (written submissions, paragraphs 347-348) that the evidence given by the plaintiff's mother firstly does not constitute an expressed or implied admission of fault and secondly is inadmissible pursuant to s 69 and this evidence should be struck out. The statements made were as follows:

""Q. Did he have a discussion with you about something which had occurred?
A. Yes, he did.

Q. Doing the best you can and trying to put it in the first person - in other words, I said, he said - what can you tell us was said during that conversation?
A. Alan - he said, ""Lorna's been injured, there's a compound fracture of her femur and the ambulance has come and helicopter is on its way"".

Q. Did you respond at all to that?
A. I said, ""Did she have a fall from her horse?"" and he said, ""No, it was my fault, my horse"". I asked, ""Has there been much blood?"" and he said, ""No, there's no bleeding"". I asked that question twice because I was very concerned about bleeding out--

Q. This was after you heard about the compound fracture?
A. Yes.

Q. I asked, ""Which hospital?"" and he said, ""Westmead"" and I said, ""I'll be leaving here in ten minutes and he replied that he had some things to do and he would get thee when he could."" (T 314)

244All that the defendant was saying was that the plaintiff had not fallen from her horse but had fallen because it was ""my fault, my horse"". That is not an admission about liability, but a description of the accident. Accordingly, the evidence does not amount to an admission.

245A second matter which is relied upon as an admission (plaintiff's written submissions, paragraph 164) is that some time after the accident the stallion Wrangler was taken to the local abbatoir and shot. The plaintiff submits that this is significant, as, 

""[i]f indeed the stallion had no propensity for misconduct, as suggested by the Defendant, it would be unlikely that he would cause the animal to be destroyed for what he claims was but an aberration, particularly given the total costs of the stallion, including transporting from the US to the UK and UK to Australia.""

246The explanation given by the defendant for having the horse destroyed was as followed:

""I was in a relationship with Lorna and she couldn't bear to look at him. I made that decision and I stand by it."" (T 443)

247He was asked why he had not simply arranged for the horse to be taken to another property and he said:

""Because he was my horse and I was emotionally distraught and this is what Lorna - this is what I felt Lorna would feel best by so it's what I did. At the time he was the national champion though he was the only one at the Show at this particular - he had huge potential. I did this for the reasons I've stated."" (T 444)

248In written submissions, Mr Jones says that the ""suggestion"" that the stallion was destroyed for these reasons makes no sense, as it would have been a simple matter to relocate the stallion on another property in order to be away from the plaintiff. 

249I do not accept this submission. The plaintiff had been very seriously injured and the defendant was distraught. They were in a de facto relationship at the time. The destruction of Wrangler was, I find, for the reasons stated and not an admission by the defendant that the horse had a bad propensity, nor was it an admission by the defendant that he had given the advice which the plaintiff claims he gave her on the day of the accident prior to the plaintiff and defendant setting out on their ride.

Conclusions concerning liability

250I have found in favour of the defendant on the issue of liability.

251In the event that I have erred in my findings in favour of the defendant, I set out my findings in relation to contributory negligence.

Contributory negligence

252The particulars of contributory negligence set out in the defence are as follows:

(a)The defendant relies upon the facts and particulars pleaded in paragraphs 13 to 31 above.

(b)The plaintiff failed to inform the defendant that ""Aletist"" was in season.

(c)The plaintiff failed to avoid riding her horse ""Freckles"" in the company of ""Wrangler"" in the direction of, or near, or in the vicinity of, ""Aletist"" which was in season.

(d)The plaintiff failed to advise or warn the defendant not to ride ""Wrangler"" in the direction of, or near, or in the vicinity of, ""Aletist"".

(e)The plaintiff failed to prevent or stop or avoid the defendant riding his horse ""Wrangler"", which was a stallion and ""fresh"", in the direction of, or near, or in the vicinity of, the plaintiff's horse named ""Aletist"" which was in season.

(f)The plaintiff failed to take due care for her own safety.

253Sections 5R and 5S of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) provide as follows:

""5R Standard of contributory negligence 

(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm. 

(2) For that purpose: 

(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and 

(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time. 

5S Contributory negligence can defeat claim 

In determining the extent of a reduction in damages by reason of contributory negligence, a court may determine a reduction of 100% if the court thinks it just and equitable to do so, with the result that the claim for damages is defeated.""

254The plaintiff was wholly responsible for the decision to put the two mares in the arena paddock in which she and the defendant had been regularly riding for the past eight months. She was the owner of the property, she was responsible for the transfer of these mares, which were her property, and she formed the decision to put them in this paddock without consulting the defendant. 

255The defendant was absent from the property and would have had no way of knowing that either of the horses was in season unless he was told by the plaintiff. Being told seven days beforehand that a horse was in season would not, as I have already found, have been enough to put him on notice, in relation to his Saturday ride with the plaintiff, that there was a horse in season in the paddock in which the parties regularly rode, if the plaintiff started saddling up for the ride without mentioning the matter. The question is whether or not the plaintiff reminded the defendant on the day of the accident that the paddock in which they usually took their rides was not available because she had put a horse in season into that paddock.

256I have indicated I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence that she did have such a conversation. If she did not tell the defendant (and I note again that this is a case of actual knowledge being pleaded, not constructive knowledge of the potential for danger) then this was negligence to the standard considered by the court to be appropriate for a finding of 100% contributory negligence as authorised by s 5S Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). This is negligence at the same standard as the conduct of the plaintiff in Wynbergen v Hoyts Corp Pty Ltd (1997) 149 ALR 25 and in Adams by her next friend O'Grady v State of New South Wales [2008] NSWSC 1257 where Rothman J explained at [132]:

""[132] The relative culpability of the State of New South Wales and Ms Adams, on the above analysis, would result in Ms Adams' contributory negligence being 100% of the damage caused. Section 9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 provides that contributory negligence does not defeat the claim for damage. However, ss 5R and 5S of the Civil Liability Act, require the Court to apply the same principles in determining contributory negligence, as are applied in determining the claim for negligence. In that respect, the standard of care in contributory negligence is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person. I take that to include the diminished responsibility of Ms Adams. Further s 5S of the Civil Liability Act reinstates the outcome that contributory negligence can be assessed at 100% of the damage. This is not a reinstatement of the historical position that contributory negligence was a complete defence. Historically, minimal contributory negligence would be a complete defence to an action in negligence. This simply clarifies that in assessing relative culpability and respective share in the responsibility, the Court is entitled to come to a view that the contributory negligence should be assessed at 100% of the cause of the injury.""

257If I have erred in accepting the evidence of the defendant as to the conversation on the day in question, the plaintiff still failed to take due care for her own safety by creating the danger in the first place, in that she put two mares, one of whom she knew to be in season, in the paddock which she knew was used for weekly rides by herself and the defendant. Had she put these two mares into another paddock, the likelihood of the accident occurring would be non-existent. There was no reason for these horses to be in this particular paddock, and it would have been a straightforward matter for the plaintiff to put them in another paddock; the plaintiff said that she suggested to the defendant, on the morning in question, that these two horses could have been easily moved to another paddock. This is part of the evidence which suggests that there were other paddocks in which these horses, one of which was in season, could have been placed, and that this should have been done by the plaintiff. 

258The defendant, who was living away from the property during the week, and who was not the owner of the property or of the horses in question, had no say in which paddock the horses were placed. While the precise date when the horses were returned to the property by the plaintiff is in doubt, it is not disputed that it occurred at a time when the defendant was not living on the property, and that he continued to remain away from the property until the day of the accident apart from the carrying out of the feeding. As I have indicated elsewhere, I do not accept the submissions of the plaintiff that the defendant would have occasion to observe that Aletist was in heat while carrying out the feeding.

259Essentially the plaintiff's argument is that the defendant failed to warn her of the consequences of her actions in placing a mare in season in a paddock when which it was her practice to ride with the defendant. 

260In Mackenzie v The Nominal Defendant (2005) 43 MVR 315, the Court of Appeal set aside a finding of contributory negligence of 100% and substituted a finding of 80% where a passenger responsible for putting an inexperienced friend without a driver's licence and with no prior experience on a motorcycle as a rider. 

261The correct approach of the court to a finding for contributory negligence was explained by the High Court in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at 494 per Gibb CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Deane JJ as follows:

""The making of an apportionment as between a plaintiff and a defendant of their respective shares in the responsibility for the damage involves a comparison both of culpability, ie of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man (Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] AC 663 at 682; Smith v McIntyre [1958] Tas SR 36 at 42-49 and Broadhurst v Millman [1976] VR 208 at 219, and cases there cited. It is the whole conduct of each negligent party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which must be subjected to comparative examination. The significance of the various elements involved in such an examination will vary from case to case; for example, the circumstances of some cases may be such that a comparison of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage will be of little, if any, importance.""

262Taking into account the significance of the various elements involved in an examination of the plaintiff's conduct, I am satisfied that even if the plaintiff did tell the defendant on the day she transferred the horses to the top paddock and reminded him of this prior to going on the ride, her role in creating the risk was so significant that a percentage for contributory negligence comparable to Mackenzie v The Nominal Defendant, namely 80%, should be apportioned. Her statement that one of two horses had been in season up to seven days prior to the proposed ride was only one of the factors which led to the accident. The plaintiff's significant role in creating the risk needs to be given full weight when considering issues of contributory negligence.

2708352,Monaghan Surveyors Pty Ltd v Stratford Glen-Avon Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 94,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

In 1997 the respondent purchased a property traversed by a right of carriageway. This right of carriageway allowed the occupants of neighbouring land access to a public road. Prior to purchase the neighbours agreed with the respondent to permit it to move the right of carriageway. The respondent contracted with the first appellant for a plan of the new right of carriageway. Prior to the registration of the new right of carriageway, the second appellant (the principal of the first appellant) altered the plan. This was done without the agreement or knowledge of the respondent or the neighbours. The plan was registered.

The discovery of the full extent of the alterations, in February 2004, was accompanied by disputation and litigation between the respondent and the neighbours. This disputation and litigation related to the alteration of the plans and the quality of the roadway. The respondent incurred losses, being:

(a) the surveying and legal expenses required to correct the title,
(b) the costs of moving a retaining wall and fencing which encroached on the right of carriageway,
(c) the costs of the litigation in the Supreme Court between the respondent and the neighbours,
(d) the loss resulting from the inability to sell the land while it was subject to a caveat lodged by the neighbours.

The respondent brought proceedings in the District Court against the appellants, seeking to recover these losses. The respondent's action was founded in the tort of negligence, misleading and deceptive conduct contrary to Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW), s 42 and Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), s 52, breach of contract and breach of the warranty implied pursuant to Trade Practices Act, s 74. The District Court ordered that the appellants pay the respondent the sum of $474,360.89.

The appellants appealed to this Court from the orders of the District Court. The appellants conceded liability and their obligation to pay for losses (a) and (b). The appellants denied that they bore responsibility for the whole of losses (c) and (d), as claimed.

The issues for determination on appeal were whether the respondent was properly entitled to recover:

(i) the whole of its legal costs in respect of the litigation in the Supreme Court between the respondent and the neighbours, and

(ii) the losses resulting from its inability to sell the property while the caveat was in place.

The Court held (per Basten JA, McColl and Young JJA agreeing), allowing the appeal in part:

In relation to (i)

1. In circumstances where a claimant seeks to recover legal costs incurred in defending proceedings brought against it, where the litigation is said to have been caused by a third party, the harm suffered may be identified as the loss of an opportunity to avoid the litigation. Where the claimant has successfully defended the litigation, the loss will be measured by reference to the difference between the costs incurred and the costs recovered from the other party: [64]

University of Western Australia v Gray (No 28) [2010] FCA 586; 185 CLR 335; Gray v Sirtex Medical Ltd [2011] FCAFC 40; 193 FCR 1, referred to.

However, the case was run on the basis of expenses incurred, not loss of opportunity.

2. Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), Pt 1A applied to the claims for damages brought in tort and contract. These claims were assumed to involve a failure to exercise due care and skill, which constitutes ""negligence"" for the purposes of Pt 1A: [67]

3. Both s 5D(1)(b) and (2) of Civil Liability Act were intended to cover factors variously described as ""value judgments"", ""normative considerations"" or ""legal policy"". The normative enquiry under s 5D(1)(b) was intended to extend beyond what have been traditionally been seen as elements of causation, to cover questions raised by intervening and successive causes, foreseeability and remoteness: [69]-[70]

4. The content of the principles invoked by Civil Liability Act, s 5D(1)(b) and (2) may varying according to the circumstances and the cause of action: [73]

5. The result of the claim pursuant to Fair Trading Act, s 42 would be the same whether the claim is assessed pursuant to Civil Liability Act, s 5D or under the general law. However, negligence is not a necessary element of a contravention of s 42 and it would seem curious if, by a side wind, some claims under s 42 were to be subject to the Civil Liability Act, Pt 1A, and some were not: [75]-[78]

6. The claim under the Trade Practices Act was not subject to Civil Liability Act, s 5D, because s 82, which provided the remedy by way of damages for breach of s 52, was not constrained by State law, unless that law were picked up and applied by another Commonwealth law: [79]

Insight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young [2010] NSWCA 137; 241 FLR 125 applied.

7. The legal costs incurred by the respondent up to the point at which the full extent of the alterations was discovered fell within the scope of the first appellant's liability for breach of contract. It was not established that the ongoing litigation, after the extent of the alterations was discovered, might reasonably have been in the contemplation of the parties to the contract at the time it was made as the probable result of the breach in question: [92], [94]

Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 ER 145 applied.

8. In relation to the claim in tort, the loss suffered by the respondent until the extent of the alterations was discovered, and resulting from the litigation pursued by the neighbours, was readily foreseeable and was appropriately recovered from the appellants. The costs of litigation after the extent of the alterations were discovered were not recoverable. The fact that the neighbours used the continued existence of the caveat to agitate other disputes, at cost to the respondent, does not provide an adequate basis for imposing liability for those costs on the appellants. In circumstances in which claims in tort and contract give rise to differing outcomes, that outcome would require an exceptional justification in circumstances where it resulted because of a breach of duty to third persons who had made no claim against the appellants: [96], [100]-[101]

9. In relation to the claims of misleading and deceptive conduct, the costs of litigation after the extent of the alterations were discovered were not recoverable in circumstances where the conduct complained of involved implied representations which involved no different consequences or considerations for the injured parties than those which arose in tort or, in relation to the first appellant, in breach of contract: [102]

In relation to (ii)

10. There is no basis to overturn the findings of the trial judge in relation to the loss resulting from the inability to sell the property while the caveat was in place. While it maybe said that the loss flowing from the breach of duty by the appellants should have ended in or shortly after the extent of the alterations was discovered, the amount in issue is not sufficient to warrant a retrial and the challenge should be dismissed: [108]

1McCOLL JA: I agree with Basten JA's reasons and the orders his Honour proposes.

2BASTEN JA: In 1997 the respondent purchased a property at Kurrajong Heights. The property was semi-rural. It was traversed by an unsealed road by which the occupants of neighbouring land were able to obtain access to their land from a public road.

3Prior to purchase, the respondent sought to negotiate with the neighbours to change the location of a road across the property, over which the neighbours enjoyed a right of carriageway. After the purchase was completed, agreement was reached and a new road was constructed. A surveyor contracted by the respondent prepared a plan for registration of the new right of way, which was signed by the respondent and the benefiting neighbours. However, prior to registration, the surveyor altered the plan, without the agreement or knowledge of either the respondent or the benefiting neighbours. In 2004, several years after the plan was registered, the variations were revealed. Identification of the full extent of the changes was accompanied by rancorous disputation and litigation between the respondent and the benefiting neighbours. The respondent incurred costs in relocating the registered right of way and reconstructing in part the roadway, together with legal costs of settling the disputes with the owners of two of the benefiting properties. 

4Seeking to recover those costs and expenses, the respondent brought proceedings against the surveyor (the first appellant) and its principal (the second appellant, Mr Monaghan) who carried out the critical work. In the District Court, the respondent obtained a judgment in its favour in the sum of $474,360.89, a figure which may well have been approximately half the value of the land when the plan was registered. The correct assessment, according to the appellants, is an amount of $25,938.29, plus interest. 

5The appellants now concede liability and the dispute between them and the respondent is limited to the quantum of damages for which they are liable. Nevertheless, consideration will need to be given to the specific heads of liability, as they raise questions as to the proper basis for assessing loss.

6For the reasons set out below, the appellants are entitled to a reduction in the quantum of the judgment, error being demonstrated in the approach adopted by the trial judge. 

Factual background
7At the date of purchase by the respondent, its land was burdened by a right of carriageway. The right provided access to three parcels of land located to the west of the respondent's land owned, respectively, by Mr and Mrs Hulbert, Mr Rees and Mrs and Ms Henderson. A sketch plan of the lands involved is annexure 1 to this judgment. Heritage Road, a public road, lay to the east of the affected lands. Thence an unsealed road proceeded across a property owned by Mr and Mrs Barrett to what was, in effect, the mid-point of the southern boundary of the land owned by the respondent, a point described in the evidence as ""Barrett Junction"". The roadway then proceeded due north to the northern boundary of the respondent's land, passing quite close to the house erected on the land. The roadway then swung to the southwest, leaving the respondent's land via the western boundary, at a point not far from the southwestern corner. The change which the respondent was able to agree with the neighbours to the west involved realigning the course of the roadway from Barrett Junction in a more westerly direction, so that it did not pass close to the house. Further, instead of proceeding to the northern boundary of the land, it swung due west at a point approximately halfway between the southern and northern boundaries, connecting with the old roadway shortly before it reached the western boundary of the property.

8The directors of the respondent were Desmond and Dianne McCammon. They were also beneficiaries of a superannuation trust of which the respondent was the trustee. All relevant steps taken on behalf of the respondent were taken by Mr McCammon.

9The first meeting between Mr McCammon and the benefiting neighbours took place in April 1997, before the respondent purchased the land. The negotiations did not prove to be straightforward. According to Mr McCammon, Ms Lucy Henderson stated that she liked the carriageway ""where it is"" and walked out of the meeting. There was, however, general agreement that the roadway was in a bad state of repair and required prompt restoration work. Mr McCammon was proposing that the respondent would bear the costs of surveying and constructing the roadway at the proposed new location, which would have involved a costs saving to the neighbours. By letter dated 30 April 1997, the Hulberts indicated their willingness to co-operate. However, more than a year later, on 27 August 1998, Ms Henderson wrote to the McCammons stating in categorical terms that there could no change to the right of way without either her agreement, or ""by an order of the Supreme Court"". She continued, ""I do not agree to any relocation of the existing right of way"". She also expressed concern as to the need for repairs because the roadway in its then state was ""dangerous"". Despite that uncompromising position, on 21 September 1998 solicitors acting for Margaret and Lucy Henderson stated that their clients ""agree to the relocation of the right of way over your property provided the survey, construction etc. costs are totally payable by you and done to the necessary standard of vehicles including heavy trucks to travel upon it"".

10A deed was ultimately executed on 3 September 1999. The neighbours were described as ""adjoining owners"". The plan which is annexure1 to this judgment was annexed to the deed. A specification for the construction works was also annexed. The deed required the respondent, at its own expense, to construct the new right of way in accordance with the specification: clause 1. The adjoining owners were to release the old right of carriageway, which was identified by Land Titles Office dealing and registration numbers; the respondent agreed to grant the new right of carriageway which was described as the right of carriageway coloured red on the plan and was described as the ""relocated section"" (being a new unsealed roadway of approximately 200 metres) and the remains of the old carriageway to which the new road joined near the western boundary of the land. The deed further provided:

""6. The construction of the New Right of Carriageway shall be supervised by Mr G J McDonald ... of G J McDonald Associates Pty Ltd. A certificate from Mr McDonald (McDonald's certificate) certifying that the New Right of Carriageway has been completed in accordance with the Specification shall be conclusive evidence that the work has been so completed.

7. (a) Stratford [being the respondent] warrants to the Adjoining Owners that the Relocated Section will be constructed in a good and workmanlike manner.
(b) This Warranty will be for a period of two (2) years from the date of issue of McDonald's Certificate.
(c) Stratford warrants to the adjoining owners that within a period of two (2) years from the date of issue of McDonald's Certificate it will pay the cost of rectification of any part of the Relocated Section that has been damaged due to rainwater, storm, subsidence or that has been constructed in a defective manner due to faulty materials and/or fault workmanship.
(d) The warranty is void in any of the following events:

(i) if a motor vehicle weighing (with its load) more than 20 tonnes or any semi-trailer travels along the Relocated Section.
...

(e) This warranty does not extend to damage caused by excessive vehicle speed or caused deliberately by persons or persons unknown.""

11The plan annexed to the deed was, self-evidently, a sketch plan and, unlike the easements and rights of carriageway already in existence, was simply identified as ""(H) Proposed Access"". 

12The specifications for the construction of the carriageway were required to be read ""in conjunction with"" a document identified in the proceedings as the ""Bowdens plans"". Specific requirements of the specification will be referred to below. The Bowdens plans incorporated the necessary engineering detail, giving precise measurements for the earthworks, placement of the roadway and necessary measurements. The effect of the relocation of the roadway was to take the new section down the side of a gully or depression to the west of the house, across a relatively level area and up an incline on the western side. As will be noted, the effectiveness of the drainage of the roadway became an issue after the construction was complete.

13Although the details are not relevant, delay in executing the deed resulted from a dispute as to the terms of the warranty in clause 7. It appears that, after the deed had been executed by Mr Rees and the Hulberts, the respondent sought a variation involving the deletion of clause 7, to avoid the obligations imposed on it by the warranty. Ms Henderson resisted the change. The respondent's solicitors obtained letters from both Mr Rees and the Hulberts indicating their willingness to join as plaintiffs in any legal action in the Supreme Court initiated by the respondent, in the event that Ms Henderson did not change her mind. On 11 August 1999 the respondent's solicitors noted that they had had a preliminary conference with counsel in relation to drafting ""the necessary statement of claim and affidavits"". On 31 August, however, the respondent apparently abandoned its position, whereupon the solicitor for the Hendersons sought an additional condition requiring payment to their clients of $1,150 on account of additional legal costs incurred in respect of the proposed deletion of clause 7.

14In accordance with the timetable envisaged by the deed, namely construction within two months of the date of the deed, construction was undertaken under the supervision of Mr McDonald and completed on 28 October 1999. On 1 February 2000 Mr McDonald certified that the road had been constructed in accordance with the specifications and, generally, in accordance with the Bowdens plan ""with some amendments"".

15Following the completion of the construction work, the respondent retained the appellants to prepare a ""work as executed"" survey and a ""linen plan"" to allow the new right of carriageway to be registered.

16In fact, the survey was undertaken in November 1999, after the road base had been laid, in order to establish the centreline of the roadway and to provide some details of cross-sections and gradients. That work was undertaken at the request of Mr McDonald. Mr Monaghan undertook the boundary survey of the reconstructed part of the roadway on 8 November 1999. On 12 November 1999, he placed pegs along the centreline of the new carriageway.

17On 29 December 1999, he sent a copy of the linen plan, together with a draft s 88B instrument to the respondent's solicitors. The McCammons were then overseas, but on their return in early February 2000 they signed a copy of the linen plan (""the original linen plan"") prepared by Mr Monaghan as instructed by the respondent. The trial judge stated that, ""[b]y early March 2000 all of the interested parties had signed the linen plan and the s 88B instrument"": judgment, p 4. He further noted that the documents were lodged for registration on or about 13 March 2000. On 21 March 2000 the Director of Land Titles wrote to both Mr Monaghan and to the solicitors for the respondent enclosing a number of requisitions relating to the survey and requiring some changes to the s 88B instrument, primarily for the purpose of recognising the release of the existing right of way. The final version of the linen plan showing the new right of way was registered on 3 April 2000. The critical events, giving rise to the now accepted liability on the part of the appellants, occurred between 21 March and 3 April 2000.

18Between the lodgement of the original linen plan and the re-lodgement following the requisitions, Mr Monaghan made changes to the alignment of the right of way as shown on the original linen plan. Those amendments appear in ""Plan 6"", which is Annexure 2 to this judgment. There were, in substance, two amendments: the first was on the unrelocated carriageway on the western side of the property, where the boundaries were shifted by between half and one metre to the east. In some parts, this achieved a minor reduction in the width of the carriageway.

19The second and more significant change occurred at the southeast point of the carriageway, known as Barrett Junction. There, Mr Monaghan varied the eastern boundary, in effect excising a triangular sliver of land from the right of way. At that point, the roadway dipped to the west of the higher ground, leading Mr McCammon to build a timber retaining way on the northeast (upper) side of the roadway. That retaining wall was built almost entirely within the sliver of land excluded by Mr Monaghan's amendment.

20Why Mr Monaghan made the amendments is no longer important. Importantly, he did not disclose that he had made changes to the party which had contracted with his company to undertake the work, namely the respondent. Nor was any disclosure made at that time to the neighbours. In broad terms, the appellants now accept that they were liable to compensate the respondent for any loss suffered by it as a result of the changes to the original linen plan made by Mr Monaghan.

Nature of losses
21The losses suffered by the respondent and claimed from the appellant fell into four categories. First, there were the surveying and legal expenses required to correct the title. Secondly, there were the costs of carrying out works on the land to move the retaining wall and fencing which encroached within the boundaries of the right of way. The appellants accepted that they were obliged to meet these heads of loss.

22Thirdly, the respondent claimed the costs of litigation between it and the neighbours which commenced in August 2002 and continued for more than five years. Fourthly, the respondent claimed costs resulting from its inability to sell the land during the period the land was subject to a caveat lodged by the neighbours, which was not finally withdrawn until 14 May 2009. The appellants deny responsibility for these expenses, or, in the alternative, for all but a limited part of them. 

23The largest amounts in dispute are the costs incurred by the respondent in two sets of litigation in the Supreme Court with its neighbours. In figures accepted by the trial judge, those costs were said to total some $319,437. With the amount allowed for the loss of sale, namely $20,000, and the amount allowed for re-surveying the right of way, lodging the fresh s 88B instrument and the physical work in respect of fencing, retaining walls, drainage and road works (totalling $14,780) the total amount allowed was $354,217. However, by agreement, that was reduced to $337,658, the basis of the reduction not being revealed to the trial judge (or to this Court). A further amount of $136,703 was allowed by way of interest.

24To assess these positions it is necessary to refer to the history of the disputation between the respondent and the benefiting neighbours and identify how the changes to the linen plan were revealed. The primary question on the appeal is, therefore, whether the respondent was properly entitled to recover the whole of its legal costs in respect of the Supreme Court proceedings. That, in turn, required analysis of the conduct of three sets of parties, namely:

(a) the appellants;
(b) the respondent, through its principal, Mr McCammon, and
(c) the neighbours with whom the respondent was in dispute.

25In relation to the benefiting neighbours, it may be noted that the Hulberts played no part in the disputation after the agreement of 1999 was concluded. Further, the evidence does not reveal any significant part being played by Mrs Dianne McCammon, although she was also a director and beneficiary of the trust held by the respondent. Nor did the evidence demonstrate any significant role played by Mrs Margaret Henderson, the mother of Ms Lucy Henderson, although both were party to the subsequent litigation. (It is convenient hereafter to refer to the Hendersons and Mr Rees collectively as ""the neighbours"".) From mid-2002 at the latest, the Hulberts played no part in the disputation.

History of disputation
26Precisely what happened between 4 April 2000 and 9 July 2002 is not well explained in the evidence. However, on the latter date, the neighbours lodged a caveat against the respondent's title. The issue raised by the caveat concerned the boundaries of the southwest (""unrelocated"") section of the right of way, which was not meant to have been affected by the new (""relocated"") section. In response to a query, on 20 July 2002 Mr Monaghan wrote to Mr McCammon explaining that changes had been made to the unrelocated part of the right of way. 

27The correspondence during 2000 and the first half of 2002 revealed ongoing concerns as to the drainage of the road and correct placement of the fencing on the unrelocated section. In May 2002 Mr Rees had sought to survey the whole of the new right of carriageway and the placement of the fences. On 31 July 2002, a letter of demand was sent by solicitors for the neighbours to solicitors for the respondent.

28On 12 August 2002, the neighbours commenced the first proceedings in the Equity Division, against the respondent. The critical order sought was to be found in paragraph 5 of the summons:

""5. An order that the defendant do all necessary acts and things and sign all necessary documents:

a. to remove any encroachment upon the New Right of Carriageway;
b. to provide adequate and proper drainage for the New Right of Carriageway;
c. to obtain and provide to the plaintiffs a surveyor's report on the width and position of the New Right of Carriageway; and/or
d. in the alternative to c, to permit a surveyor retained by the plaintiffs to enter onto the land ... for the purposes of preparing a report to them on the width and position of the New Right of Carriageway.""

29Separately, and more generally than paragraph 5(b), the summons sought an order that the defendant ensure that ""the condition of the New Right of Carriageway complies with the Specifications which are Annexure B to the Deed, and the Deed generally"": clause 4. The defendant was to be restrained from dealing with the property until those works were completed.

30On 14 August 2002 the respondent's solicitors indicated its willingness to resurvey the right of way and move, at its cost, any fencing which encroached upon the right of way. It rejected the request to carry out drainage works at Barrett Junction, noting that its warranty as to compliance with the specification annexed to the deed had been for a period of two years, which had expired. It also declined to pay legal costs incurred by the neighbours, noting it had been unaware of the problem in relation to the position of the right of carriageway until their letter of 31 July 2002, upon which it had immediately acted. The letter sought, in substance:

(a) variation of the registered right of way to conform to the original linen plan;
(b) removal of fencing which encroached upon the right of way;
(c) improved drainage, both at the point where the relocated section joined the unrelocated section and at Barrett Junction;
(d) a further survey to confirm that the right of way was five metres wide at Barrett Junction, and
(e) the costs of works, surveying and the neighbours' legal costs to be borne by the respondent, although the neighbours agreed to pay half the cost of moving the fencing on the unrelocated section and the drainage works where the two sections joined.

31There was no doubt that the respondent was anxious to settle the dispute expeditiously, as it had put the property on the market and had received an offer to purchase. It needed to have the caveat removed. On 28 August 2002 its solicitors wrote again inquiring as to the intended response to their letter of 14 August and seeking a copy of the engineer's report which was to be prepared, in accordance with interlocutory orders of the Court. The neighbours' solicitors responded on 28 October 2002 accepting the resolution in principle of the surveying problem but noting a number of ""practical difficulties inherent in the current right of access"". They sought to explore the possibility of reaching agreement upon modifications to resolve the practical difficulties.

32In November 2002, G J Ryan & Associates Pty Ltd, the civil engineers contracted by the neighbours, provided a report recommending a pavement width of three metres with a half metre shoulder on either side and a one metre table drain in areas of cut. Fence lines at bends were to be relocated. On 5 November 2002, the neighbours' solicitors requested compliance with the works proposed by the engineer, at the respondent's expense, access to the respondent's property for a surveyor to check the plans against the agreement of 3 September 1999 and payment of the neighbours' costs.

33On 18 November 2002 the respondent's solicitor reiterated its earlier position, namely that in respect of the condition of the roadway, it was entitled to rely on the certificate of Mr McDonald provided in accordance with the agreement and the fact that the warranty period had expired. It indicted willingness to consider broadening the access point at Barrett Junction and noted that repositioning of the fencing along the unrelocated section of the right of way had already commenced. That offer was in substance repeated by letter dated 19 December 2002. Nothing was said in any of this correspondence as to the possibility of an outstanding sale being jeopardised by the continued existence of the caveat. 

34The respondent asked Mr Monaghan to prepare a new plan to ensure that the right of way conformed to the old right of way on the unrelocated section, and widening the right of way at Barrett's Junction. On 10 March 2003, the respondent's solicitor wrote to Mr Monaghan noting that the respondent no longer wished to concede the additional land at Barrett's Junction. There appears to have been some short delay in complying with this request, but the new plan was provided on 23 April 2003 by the appellants. On 1 May 2003 the plan was forwarded to the solicitors for the neighbours, seeking their signatures, without making the proposal conditional upon the withdrawal of the caveat or settlement of the court proceedings. Both were, however, identified as subsequent steps to be taken by them.

35On 4 September 2003 the solicitors for the neighbours wrote again with a further proposal, seeking, in effect, a reconstruction of the Barrett Junction portion of the roadway, to ensure that they had ""the benefit of five full metres useable width of carriageway"" and that the ""tight turn at the junction be avoided"". The letter also referred for the first time to the suggestion that ""the position of the road near the Barrett Junction point is different to that shown on Plan A"", being the original linen plan. The neighbours agreed to pay for the construction of the road on both sides of Barrett Junction. The letter was made ""without prejudice"" and was understood by the respondent's solicitors as a Calderbank offer. 

36On 11 September 2003 the respondent's solicitors replied seeking particulars in respect of some of the proposed changes. They noted that part of the roadway near Barrett Junction was less than a consistent five metres in width and referred to a survey report of Teerman Newton of 21 August 2002. On 13 October, the neighbours' solicitors served a formal offer of compromise. The offer required that the respondent do all things necessary to ensure that the registered right of way conform to the original linen plan and, in particular, that it remove the retaining wall and fence which encroached upon the right of carriageway approximately five metres north of the boundary of Barrett Junction. This appears to have been the first occasion on which the allegation that the retaining wall was within the right of way was expressly identified. No other works were required: there was no reference to drainage. The offer was also conditional upon payment of not more than $10,000 on account of the neighbours' costs, although an alternative offer without reference to costs was also made, costs being payable under court rules. 

37Acceptance of that offer of compromise would have ended the proceedings, without obliging the respondent to carry out road works or drainage.

38That offer was not accepted. On 11 November 2003 the respondent's solicitors replied with, in effect, a counteroffer including the statement that ""[t]he retaining wall does not encroach on the easement"".

39On 17 November 2003 counsel acting for the respondent prepared a draft formal offer of compromise which was forwarded to the McCammons on 26 November. The letter noted the solicitor's belief that the plaintiffs would not agree to pay any of the respondent's costs. On 28 November, Mr McCammon wrote to Mr Monaghan asking for a copy of a plan which restored the relocated section to its original intended position and gave a narrow strip at the Barrett Junction to allow for possible road straightening. The respondent's offer was served on 1 December 2003.

40For many months in 2003 Mr McCammon had steadfastly resisted attempts by Mr Gibson of Teerman Newton Richmond Pty Ltd, briefed by the neighbours, to come onto the respondent's land for the purpose of resurveying the whole of the new right of way. However, on 3 February 2004, Mr Gibson was in a position to provide a plan which identified the change which had occurred north of Barrett Junction. There was no clear explanation as to how Mr Gibson's report (which appears to have constituted an essential evidential basis for the neighbours' case in the first proceedings) came to be provided to the respondent on 4 February 2004. In 2002, the configuration of the new right of carriageway at Barrett Junction was the subject of a number of concerns, but they were unrelated to the changes to the original linen plan, which had not then been identified. The issues involved the Barretts, as well as the respondent and the benefiting neighbours. It appears to have been for the purpose of resolving those issues that, in early 2004, the neighbours obtained the survey, undertaken by Mr Gibson. 

41Mr Gibson's plan of 3 February 2004 revealed the variation to the original linen plan resulting from the removal of the ""sliver"" of land on the northeast boundary of the new right of carriageway at Barrett Junction. Mr Gibson's survey was sent to Mr Monaghan and, on 6 February 2004, he prepared a plan accepting the correctness of Mr Gibson's survey and noting that the timber retaining wall was within the right of way as it appeared on the original linen plan. 

42The proceedings were settled on 17 February 2005 on terms which required the summons to be dismissed with no order as to costs. The agreement, as noted in the terms, required the correction of both sets of changes to the original linen plan. It required the respondent to take steps to remove encroachments, including the timber retaining wall and certain fencing. It also required the respondent, at its own cost, to create a table drain on the east of the road, as required by the specifications forming part of the deed of 3 September 1999. The respondent also agreed to construct a ""concrete dish drain with covering [grate] at Barrett Junction"". The neighbours were required to deliver an executed withdrawal of caveat in registrable form within seven days following the completion of the works to be undertaken by the respondent.

43There was very little evidence before this Court as to what happened between February 2004 and February 2005. However, as appears from a schedule of legal costs incurred by the respondent, approximately $70,000 were incurred by the respondents' solicitors up to March 2004 and a further $66,000 from March 2004 until April 2005. What can be inferred from the material in evidence is that by mid-February 2004 the respondents' then solicitors, David Pain & Co of Eastwood, were pressing Mr McCammon to make an offer of settlement which ""must include a reversion to the original plan signed by all the parties and if there are any encroachments such as the retaining fence then that encroachment must be removed and relocated outside the limits of the plans"": letter, 11 February 2004, emphasis in original. The letter continued:

""We don't know where you got the idea that they are producing a different plan. The only plan they are relying on is the one they signed and incidentally the one that you signed.

You can't blame Monaghan for your present predicament. We would have been in a much stronger position if you had followed the advice you had received and continued to offer the additional width near the Barrett junction to restore the width there to the original plan signed by the parties and remove any encroachments.""

44Mr McCammon responded on 16 February 2004 in terms which demonstrated a breakdown in the relationship. At about that time, the respondent instructed Hunt and Hunt as its new solicitors.

Second Equity proceedings
45Following the settlement, the respondent engaged an engineer, from a list of three nominated by the neighbours, to supervise the construction work. Mr Hall, of Kneebone Beretta and Hall, agreed to undertake that work, but sought to have the correct boundaries of the right of way pegged by a surveyor. It was at that stage that Mr Monaghan declined to be involved any further and the respondent engaged a new surveyor, Urbanex Pty Ltd. 

46Mr McCammon gave evidence that, following the settlement, he was dissatisfied with the terms, which he considered were not sufficiently tight. Subsequent events proved that to be correct. Although the terms anticipated a ""more formal document"" to record the agreement, none was prepared. The obligation of the neighbours on completion of the works to be undertaken by the respondent was to deliver an executed withdrawal of caveat in registrable form: the obligation did not expressly extend to signing the new linen plans. Nevertheless, it was clearly the intent of the agreement that, upon certification by the engineer contracted to supervise the work, those documents would be signed, provided to the respondent and registered.

47The works were completed in May 2005 and the certificate of the engineer was sent to the neighbours' solicitors on 8 June 2005. A new linen plan, in accordance with the original signed plan, together with a new s 88B instrument, was prepared by Urbanex and sent to the neighbours' solicitors on 11 August 2005. It was not executed and returned, despite an obligation in the terms of settlement to deliver an executed withdrawal of caveat within seven days of completion of the works to be undertaken by the respondent. Instead, the neighbours sought to dispute the accuracy of the engineer's certificate, alleging that certain aspects of the works were not in accordance with the terms of settlement.

48In May 2006 the respondent briefed new solicitors in an attempt to resolve the on-going disputation. On 2 August 2006 a second summons was issued in the Supreme Court, seeking enforcement of the terms of settlement and requiring the neighbours to execute the necessary documents to permit the registration of the new right of way and removal of the caveat. That step provoked a cross-summons by the neighbours, filed on 13 October 2006. On 7 November 2006 the respondent's solicitors made an offer of settlement. On 16 November 2006 the neighbours' solicitors responded with a counter offer in the following terms:

""1. That the plan, and the variation of easement form, be delivered to the plaintiff [the respondent], or its solicitors, duly signed by the defendants [the neighbours] on 17 November 2006.

2. The summons, the notice of motion and the cross-summons be withdrawn and dismissed.

3. Each party pay their own costs in relation to the summons, the notice of motion and the cross-summons.

4. Upon the plan having been registered, and notice having been given to the defendants accordingly, the defendants will deliver a withdrawal of caveat 87592695 within seven days to the plaintiff.""

49That offer was apparently not accepted, and a notice of motion filed on 16 November 2006 by the respondents seeking summary judgment in respect of orders sought in its summons, proceeded to hearing before Macready AsJ. Judgment was delivered on 1 December 2006. His Honour found that, in one respect, the respondent had not complied with its obligation under the terms of settlement and accordingly rejected the application for specific performance.

50There was no material in the evidence to which the Court was taken explaining why the respondent did not accept the offer of November 16. It would appear to have achieved the withdrawal of the caveat, which was the result, adverse to the respondent's interests, remaining outstanding from the dispute caused by the appellants, who were not parties in the enforcement proceedings. 

51On 24 October 2007 the neighbours made a further offer to settle the proceedings on the following terms:

""1. That the first, second and third defendants [the neighbours] execute:

(a) the Linen Plan (as referred to in the Summons filed on 2 August 2006); and
(b) the Variation of Easement document (as referred in the said Summons).

2. That the defendants deliver the executed Linen Plan and the executed Variation of Easement to the Plaintiffs' solicitors within seven days of the acceptance of this offer.

3. That the Summons and Cross-Claim be discontinued forthwith after delivery of those documents, such withdrawal being with the consent of all parties and on the basis that there be no order as to costs and that all previous costs orders be vacated. The parties shall exchange notices of consent and shall file notices of discontinuance accordingly.

4. That each party bear his, her or its own costs of and incidental to the proceedings, including costs already subject of costs orders.

5. That this settlement, when performed, shall be in full compromise, discharge and release of all the parties' respective rights and claims asserted in the subject litigation.""

52That offer was stated to remain open for acceptance by the respondent until 4pm on 31 October 2007. On that day, the respondent's solicitors wrote to the solicitors for the neighbours accepting the offer and confirming certain matters, discussed in a telephone conversation, namely that:

""(a) Stratford [the respondent] will pay the standard fees charged by mortgagee St George Bank for execution and production of the linen plan;

(b) your clients will provide the Withdrawal of Caveat on notice of registration of the linen plan;

(c) should Land and Property Information raise requisitions as to form on the linen plan the parties will co-operate to satisfy such requisitions;

(d) by reason of the necessity to involve third parties there may be difficulties satisfying the time limits in the offer but the parties will work cooperatively to complete the matter as close to those time limits as the circumstances permit.""

53Each of the steps outlined in the offer of settlement was taken by 12 December 2007. However, difficulties were raised with registration of the documents, requiring new documents to be executed. The proposed amendments were set out in a letter from the respondent's solicitors on 12 February 2008. Further delays ensued, the fresh documents being finally registered on 5 December 2008. Even then, the withdrawal of caveat was not executed by the neighbours until 14 May 2009 and was registered on that date.

Findings of trial judge
54The issue on the appeal involved the proper assessment of damages payable by the appellants to the respondent. There was no challenge to findings of liability. Nevertheless, it is necessary to identify the source of liability in order to assess the consequences for which the appellants should properly be held liable.

55The trial judge spoke in broad terms of the conduct of the appellants involving ""a gross departure from [their] obligation to the [respondent] and the benefiting owners"": judgment, p 38. He found that Mr Monaghan's actions ""led him to make amendments to the linen plan which inevitably in my view resulted in a real potential for litigation"": p 41.

56The findings as to liability dealt separately with claims in contract, breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), ss 52 and 74 and the tortious duty of care. It is necessary to identify the findings separately in respect of each.

57In respect of contract, the trial judge found the first appellant ""guilty of a fundamental breach of express and implied terms of the contract"": p 41. Two points should be noted: first, Mr Monaghan did not contract with the respondent and, accordingly, was not found liable in breach of contract. Secondly, there was no clear identification of the ""express and implied terms"" of which there was a ""fundamental breach"". The contract, as pleaded, imposed a number of obligations on the first appellant, which were in summary:

(a) to carry out a Land Titles Office search to enable the precise location of the original right of way to be determined;

(b) to place survey pegs identifying both the non-relocated section and the relocated section of the right of way, so that the latter would conform to the plan attached to the deed;

(c) to prepare a ""works as executed"" survey of the new right of way to ensure that the construction conformed to the deed;

(d) to prepare a linen plan and s 88B instrument to identify the location of the new right of way as constructed;

(e) to notify the respondent if there were differences between the plan attached to the deed and the new right of way as identified by survey, and

(f) to prepare for execution by the respondent and the benefiting owners a linen plan accurately identifying the new right of way as constructed.

58There were also alleged to be implied terms, including an obligation to exercise reasonable care and skill in undertaking the works, which were not in dispute. The trial judge found that there was a breach of the warranties implied into the contract by virtue of s 74 of the Trade Practices Act, as then in force: judgment, p 41.

59There were in effect two elements of the contractual obligations imposed on the first appellant which were breached and caused loss. First, the placement of the survey pegs, it was held, led the respondent to build fences and construct the timber retaining wall in locations which encroached on the right of way. Secondly, the changes to the linen plan resulted in the right of way being registered in a location which varied from the agreed location. There may have been satisfactory reasons for the changes, but it was a breach of contract for the surveyor to incorporate such changes without obtaining approval from the respondent. The respondent did not assert that there was any obligation on the appellants to obtain approval from the neighbours, but clearly it (the respondent) would have had a contractual obligation to take that step itself.

60In respect of the cause of action in tort, the trial judge found that there was liability on the part of the appellants, who had breached a duty of care to carry out the survey and record the results on the linen plan, in accordance with their instructions. The breach could properly be identified in the way set out above in respect of the first appellant's contractual obligation to the respondent. However, the duty of care undoubtedly extended to the neighbours who were to obtain the benefit of the right of way over the respondent's land.

61In respect of the statutory cause of action, the trial judge upheld a claim for breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act, referring to ""misleading and deceptive representations"". Those representations were not identified, but it may be understood that any conduct which fell within s 52 took the form of representations, either express or implied. Although the pleading in respect of s 52 referred to various paragraphs in the amended statement of claim, some of which were not obviously relevant, it may be accepted that the representations upheld as constituting the misleading or deceptive conduct, were in the terms as pleaded at par 37, namely that the registered linen plan - 

(a) was the same document as that executed by the respondent and the neighbours in February 2000;
(b) correctly identified the new right of way as constructed;
(c) identified the new right of way as constructed in accordance with the plan attached to the deed and the certificate of the engineer.

There may also have been an implied representation that the retaining wall and part of the fencing on the non-relocated section did not encroach upon the new right of way, whereas in fact they did.

62In finding liability under s 52, the trial judge identified the respondent as a consumer under a contract for the supply of services: p 41. Although it is not entirely clear, the finding appears to have been limited to implied representations made to the respondent. It may, however, have included representations made to the neighbours, although one might have expected that to be stated as an express finding, if made. 

63His Honour concluded that Mr Monaghan was liable ""under the accessorial provisions of s 75B of the Trade Practices Act"", but did not say for what: p 42. It may be assumed that he was intending to refer to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act as, in the following sentence, he noted that Mr Monaghan was also liable under s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). 

Causation of loss - legal principles
64The first step in considering the question of causation is to identify the nature of the loss or losses suffered. In circumstances where a claimant seeks to recover legal costs incurred in defending proceedings brought against it, where the litigation is said to have been caused by a third party, the harm suffered may be identified as the loss of an opportunity to avoid the litigation. Where the claimant has successfully defended the litigation, the loss will be the difference between the costs incurred and the costs recovered from the other party: see, for example, University of Western Australia v Gray (No 28) [2010] FCA 586; 185 FCR 335 (Barker J) and, on appeal Gray v Sirtex Medical Ltd [2011] FCAFC 40; 193 FCR 1 (Bennett, Gilmour and Gordon JJ). That case involved an invention by a staff member at the University which he sought to develop commercially through a company (Sirtex) of which he was a director. The University brought proceedings against Sirtex, unsuccessfully asserting a claim to intellectual property in the invention. However, Sirtex cross-claimed against Dr Gray on the basis that his failure to advise Sirtex of a possible claim of intellectual property in the University caused it to incur the costs of the litigation. It was successful in recovering those costs from Dr Gray as damages incurred by it as a result of his breach of duty. Dr Gray asserted that what had been lost was a commercial opportunity, which should have been assessed by reference to the probabilities or possibilities of the issue being resolved without litigation, in accordance with principles identified in Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4; 179 CLR 332: Gray (No 28) at [7]. The primary judge adopted that approach, which was not challenged on appeal, assessing Sirtex's loss as 86% of its costs, being the probability of the realisation of the lost chance of settlement without litigation: at [190].

65As this Court explained in Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504; (2009) Aust Torts Rep 82-005 at [332]:

""The history of claims for a loss of a chance in Australia has an uncertain foundation. The uncertainty arises in part from the narrow dividing line between matters going to causation (to be determined on the balance of probabilities) and matters involving the assessment of loss in hypothetical circumstances. Cases falling within the latter category include those where damages are reduced on account of contingencies which may possibly have affected the continuation of the causal effect of the tort....""

66The respondent did not plead a case involving a lost opportunity, but rather asserted boldly that its losses were the actual amounts expended by it. Nor, it would seem, did either party contend that the damages might be reduced on account of contingencies, in accordance with the principles for assessment of loss identified in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20; 169 CLR 638. On the other hand, the appellants did plead in their defence that there should be a reduction for contributory negligence and claimed that the respondent had failed to mitigate its damages. Thus, for the purposes of addressing questions of causation, the harm is to be identified as the costs incurred by the respondent and not by reference to any loss of opportunity to avoid such expenses. Where a quantified financial loss has accrued, rather than the failure of a hoped for benefit to eventuate, it cannot be said that this approach was erroneous: see generally, Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; 240 CLR 537 at [38]-[39] and [47]-[49] (Gummow ACJ); [69] (Hayne and Bell JJ); [113] and [122]-[124] (Kiefel J).

67The harm suffered by the respondent was economic loss. Putting to one side the claims under the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act for misleading or deceptive conduct, each of the other claims appears to have been assumed to involve a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill. That form of breach of duty constitutes ""negligence"" for the purposes of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), Pt 1A. Accordingly, that Part applied to the claims for damages brought in tort and contract: s 5A(1). To determine whether particular elements of harm were recoverable, the Court needed to apply s 5D, appearing in Div 3 ""Causation"". The relevant parts of the provision read:

""5D General principles

(1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements: 

(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and
(b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).

(2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.

...
(4) For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.""

68Although the conduct in breach of contract and in tort occurred (at least in part) before the commencement of Part 1A (on 6 December 2002) those provisions had application to civil liability arising before their commencement, so long as the proceedings were not commenced before that commencement: Civil Liability Act, Sch 1, cl 6(1). These proceedings were commenced in 2005.

69It is clear that both s 5D(1)(b) and (2) were intended to cover factors variously described as ""value judgments"", ""normative considerations"" or ""legal policy"". Whether paragraph (a) of s 5D(1) also includes policy considerations is less clear. The purpose of s 5D(1) has been identified as establishing a two-stage test of causation whereby what is described as ""factual causation"" is to be addressed separately from ""scope of liability"": Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak [2009] HCA 48; 239 CLR 420 at [43]. Factual causation may identify the relationship between the conduct of the tortfeasor held to involve a breach of duty and the harm claimed to have occurred as a consequence. It thus identifies a relationship between conduct and consequence which is not necessarily free of normative considerations. First, there are normative considerations which will influence a finding that particular conduct constitutes a breach of duty, which cannot usefully be ignored in considering the relationship between the conduct and the harm asserted by the plaintiff. In circumstances where the relationship between the conduct and the consequence is well understood (because explained by Newtonian physics) the temporal link may be sufficient to establish ""causation"". In other circumstances, there may be a statistical correlation, without a full understanding as to the physical mechanism by which the particular consequence may result from the tortious conduct. (An example may be asbestos exposure followed by mesothelioma.) In other circumstances again, some elements of harm may depend upon the conduct of the injured party or the further conduct of third parties. On one view, normative elements cannot be entirely expunged from a ""counter-factual inquiry"" in determining whether the conduct was a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm. In a sense, so much is implicit in sub-s (2), which recognises that in some cases where the counter-factual condition cannot be satisfied, there may nevertheless be an imposition of liability: see Wallace v Kam [2012] NSWCA 82 at [163]. 

70Secondly, it appears to have been intended that the normative inquiry under paragraph (b) would extend beyond what have traditionally been seen as elements of causation, to cover questions raised by intervening and successive causes, foreseeability and remoteness. 

71Furthermore, it is apparent from the report which formed the basis of the Act, Review of the Law of Negligence - Final Report (September 2002) (commonly known as the ""Ipp Report"") that the focus of the reform was on concepts familiar in tort law. In respect of ""factual causation"" that does not cause a difficulty. As stated by McHugh JA in Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (1987) 9 NSWLR 310 at 352C, in a passage which is reflected in the terms of s 5D:

""So far as the law of tort is concerned, the 'but for' test must be taken in this Court to be the leading and, in all but exceptional cases, the exclusive test of causation. And I can see no reason why the same test should not be applied in contract. Once causation-in-fact is established, the only question is whether the damage is so remote from the breach that the defendant should not be held responsible for it.""

72In tort, concepts of remoteness are at least partly determined by reference to that which was ""reasonably foreseeable"" at the time of the conduct. In contract, according to the classic statement of Alderson B in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 ER 145 at 151, liability will extend to that which ""may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it"". This test, with its two limbs, may operate differentially depending upon whether the claim is for loss of an expected benefit or for a loss which flows from reliance by the injured party on the proper performance of the contract.

73Although the purpose of s 5D(1)(b) and (2) is to focus on what may, succinctly, be identified as policy issues, there is no suggestion that the content of the principles is uniform, rather than varying according to the circumstances. Nor is there any suggestion that they will not vary according to the cause of action. Although entirely obiter, in circumstances where s 5D had no operation, Ipp JA expressed the view in Ruddock v Taylor [2003] NSWCA 262; 58 NSWLR 269 at [89] that s 5D embodies principles in regard to causation that ""are in accord with the common law"". As already noted, whether s 5D is properly understood to be limited to questions dealt with as ""causation"" under the common law may be doubted. As Allsop P, writing extra-judicially has noted, it is arguable that the structure of s 5D is apt to reflect the approach of McHugh J, rather than the reasoning of Mason CJ (for the majority) in March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506: J Allsop, ""Causation in Commercial Law"", ch 13 in eds S Degeling, J Edelman, J Goudkamp, Torts in Commercial Law (Lawbook Co 2011), p 294; see also Adeels Palace at [43]-[44]. On the other hand, the fact that s 5D(1) identifies two separate issues which need to be addressed, does not mean that the Court must adopt a two-stage approach to its inquiry, or that the issues can properly be regarded as separate and discrete, each from the other.

74One question raised by the form of s 5D(1) is how it should be applied in respect of continuing or consecutive harm. Thus, if the negligence was a necessary condition of some harm, is the question of liability for continuing or consecutive harm to be answered by reposing the counter-factual question from time to time, or by reference to the policy issues intended to be covered by paragraph (b)? The question illustrates the artificiality of the attempt to impose a two-stage process. The difficulty in answering the counter-factual question arises in part from the difficulty in predicting how third persons, not witnesses or parties to the litigation, would have acted, had the circumstances been different in one respect. If the answer to the counter-factual question, on the balance of probabilities, is that the breach of duty was a necessary condition of the further harm, there would then be a question as to whether liability should be limited on the basis of a remoteness principle. If the answer to the counter-factual question was in the negative, it might then be necessary to ask whether, in policy terms, the uncertainty should be put to one side because responsibility should be placed on the tortfeasor in any event, pursuant to s 5D(2).

75There is a separate issue as to whether the claim under the Fair Trading Act must assessed in accordance with s 5D of the Civil Liability Act. If the conduct in a particular case involved a negligent misrepresentation, it is arguable that it would be caught by the definition of ""negligence"" in s 5 of the Civil Liability Act. However, negligence is not a necessary element of a contravention of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act and it would seem curious if, by a side wind, some claims under s 42 were to be subject to the Civil Liability Act, Pt 1A, and some were not.

76In Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Milanex Pty Ltd (In liq) [2011] NSWCA 367, in considering whether a defence of contributory negligence was available in response to a claim under s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW), Macfarlan JA (Campbell and Young JJA agreeing) noted that ss 5R and 5S of the Civil Liability Act did not confer a right to raise a defence of contributory negligence, but operated where such a defence was otherwise available: at [87]. His Honour continued:

""In any event Part 1A Civil Liability Act, of which ss 5R and 5S form part, applies only to claims 'for damages for harm resulting from negligence' (s 5A), requiring in my view that negligence be an element of the relevant cause of action (although, as s 5A makes clear, it does not matter whether the claim is brought in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise). However, negligence is not an element of a claim for damages arising out of contravention of s 42 Fair Trading Act .... A contravention of that section may occur whether or not the defendant has been negligent. That a defendant might as a matter of fact have been careless does not convert a claim against it under s 42 into one based upon negligence.""

77The logic of that reasoning is undeniable, in terms of the language of the statute. However, it does not address an aspect of the history of the legislation which might suggest a different result. Prior to the enactment of the Statutory Duties (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 (NSW), contributory negligence constituted a defence to a claim for breach of statutory duty under the general law: Piro v W Foster & Co Ltd [1943] HCA 32; 68 CLR 313. The statutory reversal of that principle by the 1945 Act was repealed by the Civil Liability Amendment (Personal Responsibility) Act 2002 (NSW), Sch 3. In Booksan Pty Ltd v Wehbe [2006] NSWCA 3; 14 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-678; (2006) Aust Torts Rep 81-830, Ipp JA stated (with the concurrence of Giles and Tobias JJA) that the repeal of the 1945 Act reinstated the rule laid down in Piro and contributory negligence ""once more became a defence to a cause of action based on breach of statutory duty"": at [162]. Whether the assumption as to revival of the old common law principle is correct need not be considered here: c f DC Pearce and RS Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (7th ed, 2011) at [6.15]. What is of greater concern is the possibility that Pt 1A of the Civil Liability Act should apply in relation to a breach of statutory duty, which, as explained by Latham CJ in Piro ""is absolute in the relevant sense when it requires that a particular thing be done, without reference to any questions of intent or negligence, as distinct from requiring only that the person subject to the statute shall do his best to do a particular thing"": at 319. In Booksan, Ipp JA stated at [167]:

""In my opinion the consequences of the repeal of the 1945 Act ... and the insertion of s 5A into the Civil Liability Act, are clear. Irrespective of how a claim is formulated, if - in substance - it is a claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, a defence of contributory negligence may be raised to that claim even if it is based on a breach of statutory duty.""

78Having held that there had been no breach of the regulations giving rise to the statutory duty, it was ""not strictly necessary to determine"" the issue as to contributory negligence: Booksan at [155]. It may also be said, though perhaps not entirely plausibly given the context of the remarks, that Ipp JA was intending to refer to the elements of a cause of action as involving negligence. No party having identified the issue in the present case, it should not be taken further, as it is not necessary to determine it. On the assumption that s 5D(1)(b) and (2) engage questions raised under the general law as to the scope of liability, and impose no constraints themselves on relevant considerations, the result will be the same, whether the exercise is undertaken pursuant to s 5D or directly under the general law. Similarly, s 5D permits the policy of the statute under which liability arises to be given effect.

79The claim under the Trade Practices Act will not be subject to s 5D, because s 82, which provided the remedy by way of damages for breach of s 52, was not constrained by State law, unless that law were picked up and applied by another Commonwealth law: Insight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young [2010] NSWCA 137; 241 FLR 125 at [85]-[91]. It was not suggested in this case that any relevant Commonwealth law had that operation in respect of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act (as then in force). 

80The relevant legal principles to be applied in considering the statutory causes of action must derive from the statutory purpose, which may be treated as the same in respect of both Commonwealth and State legislation. In dealing with questions of remoteness, the result is not determined by applying principles relevant to contract or tort law, although in particular circumstances the result may not be materially different: Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69; 224 CLR 627 at [29]-[30] (Gleeson CJ); [49]-[50] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).

Application of principles
81During the period from July 2002 until the changes to the original linen plan were first fully disclosed in February 2004, the respondent showed reasonable diligence in seeking to settle the proceedings. It might be said that, once Mr McCammon understood that the neighbours were claiming that the location of the new right of way was not in accordance with the linen plan signed by all the parties, he should have sought to protect his position in respect of potential costs by immediately offering to settle on the basis that an independent survey would be undertaken and, if errors were identified, the title deeds would be corrected and any encroachments removed at his expense. The respondent might also have sought advice as to whether it might have liability for any deficiency in the construction of the roadway and made a similar offer based on an independent engineering report.

82These steps were not taken and, indeed, when the neighbours made an offer of compromise, which involved them paying for any reconstruction of the road, it was not accepted.

83Further, after Mr Monaghan told Mr McCammon that he had changed the location of the old right of way on the western side of the land, neither he nor Mr McCammon appears to have considered whether any other changes were made. It would have been a simple task for Mr Monaghan to have checked the original plan for the new carriageway against the registered plan, assuming he had forgotten the changes he had made some two and a half years earlier. 

84At that stage of the proceedings, the respondent was relying, it appears, upon Mr Monaghan's assurances that he had not misconducted himself in such a way as to give rise to any liability. Neither did Mr Monaghan suggest that any steps be taken in relation to the litigation to protect either the respondent or the appellants against any potential liability. Further, the respondent was unaware until February 2004 of the changes to the original linen plan at Barrett's Junction.

85Once Mr McCammon was aware of the changes to the original linen plan made in both areas by Mr Monaghan, the respondent had to decide whether to support the changes (despite their non-disclosure) and resist the counter arguments of the neighbours, or to concede that the changes should not have been made and hold the appellants responsible for the consequences. Either position was, of course, amenable to compromise if the parties were willing to resolve their disputes by varying the original linen plan to accommodate their respective interests.

86Until at least April 2005, the respondent adopted the first approach, seeking to justify the changes. In that month, following settlement with the neighbours, the respondent invited the first appellant to undertake a survey defining the correct boundaries of the right of way, so as to allow further road works to be undertaken. According to Mr McCammon, Mr Monaghan declined to be involved. The respondent obtained alternate surveyors, namely Urbanex. On 1 November 2005 the respondent commenced proceedings against the appellants.

87It is apparent from the correspondence with his then solicitors, that Mr McCammon received advice in February 2004 that the respondent should offer to settle on the basis of the changes necessary to restore a right of way free of encroachments in conformity with the original linen plan. The respondent did not take that advice, but rather changed solicitors. This Court was not taken to any material which demonstrated the reasonableness of that conduct. The trial judge did not specifically address any events between February 2004 and February 2005; he therefore made no specific findings as to the reasonableness of the respondent's conduct in that period: judgment pp 21-22.

(a) breach of contract
88Applying the contractual test, it would fairly and reasonably be expected, in the usual course of events, that the respondent would rely upon the survey of the right of way to avoid constructing encroachments. The cost of re-surveying, re-pegging and removing the encroachments would all flow naturally from the breach of contract. It may also be expected that when the breach became known, the respondent would be required by the benefiting owners to prepare and arrange for registration of complying instruments.

89The critical question is whether, in the ordinary course, it would expected that the benefiting owners would be likely to bring legal proceedings against the respondent to have the registered instrument corrected, or whether, having regard to the knowledge of both parties as to the relationship between the neighbours and the respondent, such a course was a probable result of the breach in this particular case.

90The changes in the plan might have favoured, in a practical sense, the benefiting owners or the owner of the burdened land. As a matter of fact, the respondent never expressed an objection to the changes and, from its apparent reluctance to rebuild the retaining wall, it may be inferred that it was at least neutral as to the amended plan. Thus, to the extent that there was a breach of the duty owed to the respondent, any harm suffered by the respondent was the result of its breach of the separate duty owed by it to the neighbours. It was foreseeable in those circumstances that the neighbours might bring proceedings in tort against both appellants. No doubt it would have been necessary to join the respondent as the owner of the burdened land as a necessary party to any change in the registered right of way. Had that happened, the first appellant would have borne the cost of any litigation which resulted from its recalcitrance in conceding a breach of duty. Indeed, it is difficult to see why it would have resisted appropriate orders as, apart from bearing the immediate costs resulting from its own breach of contract, it had no interest in the substantive issue as to the location of the right of way. 

91However, no such proceedings were brought: instead, the neighbours placed a caveat on the respondent's title and sought to justify it by legal proceedings against the respondent. It might also reasonably have been expected that the respondent would join the appellants to the proceedings brought by the neighbours. At no stage did the respondent purport to resile from the agreement reflected in the original linen plan and it had an interest in ensuring that the appellants bore any costs resulting from a departure from that plan. 

92There are two considerations which suggest that the legal costs up to February 2004 properly fell within the scope of a claim in contract against the first appellant. First, on the findings of the trial judge, the appellants were aware that relations between the neighbours and the respondent were prickly and that there was a lack of trust on each side. Secondly, when doubts were raised as to the correctness of the registered right of way by the neighbours, the appellants sought to justify their conduct to the respondent and, further, failed to reveal the full extent to which changes had been made to the original linen plan. In a finding which has not been challenged, the trial judge treated the failure to disclose the full extent of the alterations as a continuing breach. It was not clearly identified until early 2004 and was only conceded by the appellants at that time. Accordingly, the legal costs incurred by the respondent up to that point fell within the scope of liability which would arise from the application of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale. 

93In those circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the other bases upon which liability for those elements of harm might be imposed on the first appellant, but it may be important to determine the separate liability of Mr Monaghan, to which it will be necessary to turn. It is convenient first to address the first appellant's liability after February 2004 in terms of the claim in contract.

94Liability for the expenses incurred by the respondent after February 2004 fall into a different category. The offers to compromise made by the neighbours prior to that date demonstrated a willingness to end the litigation once the agreement recorded in the original linen plan was effected. A dispute as to the construction of the road was no part of the breach of contract by the first appellant. The conclusion that the on-going litigation, after February 2004, might reasonably have been in the contemplation of the parties to the contract, at the time it was made, as the probable result of the breach in question, was not established. It certainly would not have been covered by an assessment of the usual course of things, within the first limb of Hadley v Baxendale, nor did the trial judge make findings as to the specific circumstances known to the appellants at the time of the contract which could have given rise to an expectation, within the second limb. There should not have been a finding that the litigation after February 2004 fell within the scope of contractual liability. The contrary conclusion reached by the trial judge bears the flavour of hindsight. Further, it is by no means clear that it was reached in application of the contractual test of remoteness.

(b) claim in tort
95The liability of the appellants in tort must be separately assessed. The duty of care arose in relation to the requirement to survey the new right of way and record it on a linen plan for registration on the respondent's title. That duty was owed to each of the parties to the agreement constituted by the original linen plan. No doubt it was reasonably foreseeable that undertaking and recording the results of a survey of a road as constructed might reveal practical questions arising from its intended use as a right of way. To the extent that such issues arose, it would have been reasonable to expect that they would be dealt with in preparing the original linen plan and, to the extent that they involved a departure from the broad instructions given to the surveyor, they could then have been discussed with the parties. Changes were made thereafter, which were not communicated to the parties, nor was approval sought. That constituted the breach of duty.

96There is no reason to suppose that the analysis set out above in respect of the claim for breach of contract against the first appellant would not produce an identical result in respect of an assessment of damages in tort against both appellants. In other words, although separate duties of care were owed to the neighbours and the respondent, for breach of which the neighbours did not sue the appellants, the losses suffered by the respondent as a result of proceedings brought against it were readily foreseeable and were appropriately recovered from the appellants. The next question is whether the appellants were liable in tort for the legal expenses incurred by the respondent after February 2004.

97These costs fall into two categories. First, there are the costs of the period from February 2004 until February 2005, which related to the first proceedings. Secondly, there were costs incurred thereafter. The respondent commenced proceedings against the appellants on 1 November 2005. By that stage, the continuing disputation between the respondent and the neighbours related to the adequacy of the construction work and its compliance with the terms of settlement. However, the neighbours did not commence litigation in respect of that: it was the respondent who issued a further summons on 2 August 2006. The connection between that disputation and the breach of duty by the appellants rested on the existence of a caveat over the respondent's land. The counter-factual question raised by s 5D(1)(a), was, originally, 'would the caveat have been lodged but for the breach of duty of the appellants?' That question must be answered by reference to the likely conduct of the neighbours, none of whom gave evidence or was involved in the proceedings between the respondent and the appellants. 

98This raises the question as to the operation of s 5D noted at [74] above.

99It may be assumed for present purposes that the disputation as to the construction of the road was arguable on both sides and hence foreseeable. The respondent's position was that the certificate of the engineer was conclusive. The neighbours' position was that, in particular respects, it could be demonstrated objectively (and was ultimately conceded) that the road was not in compliance with the specification. There was a dispute as to whether the variations were significant, were desirable in terms of engineering principles and the result of physical constraints imposed by the location of the road. Once the scope of that dispute is accepted, the finding of the trial judge that the respondent (through Mr McCammon) acted reasonably in dealing with the on-going disputation with his neighbours, is not conclusive as to the imposition of liability for the additional costs on the appellants. 

100The critical question in this context is why, assuming the litigating parties each had a legitimate complaint in relation to the construction of the road, which had nothing to do with the original breach of duty by the appellants, the appellants should be required to compensate the respondent for the costs of resolving that dispute. While accepting that the breach of duty by the appellants provided the neighbours' bargaining chip, in the sense of the original entitlement to place a caveat on the respondent's land, it is clear from the offers made prior to February 2004 that the neighbours were prepared to settle their dispute over the appellants' breaches of duty on terms which were unrelated to the complaints they then had as to the construction of the road. The fact that, somewhat opportunistically, they used the continued existence of the caveat to agitate other disputes, at cost to the respondent, does not provide an adequate basis for imposing liability for those costs on the appellants.

101There is a further reason for reaching that conclusion. It is found in the circumstance that those costs would not, as found above, be recoverable in breach of contract. Although it may be accepted that the principles for assessing damage under tort and contract are not identical, and may in some circumstances give rise to differing outcomes, that result should be carefully scrutinised to see why the law is imposing liability in tort in circumstances where liability would not arise under the contractual arrangement between the parties. Importantly in this case, for the reasons already explained, such an outcome would require an exceptional justification in circumstances where it resulted, not because of a breach of duty in tort to the other contracting party, but because of a breach of duty to third persons, who had made no claim against the appellants.

(c) breach of statutory duties
102The final question is whether the further costs after February 2004 were recoverable in causes of action for misleading or deceptive conduct, either under the Fair Trading Act or under the Trade Practices Act. No submission was put in the present case which would justify recovery on the statutory causes of action in respect of harm not recoverable in tort or contract. It is not, therefore, necessary to consider whether, and if so why, this might be an exceptional case where different results would apply to assessment of loss under the statutory schemes. The reason why such a differential outcome is implausible is that the conduct complained of involved implied representations which involved no different consequences or considerations for the injured parties than those which arose in tort or, in relation to the first appellant, in breach of contract.

Conclusions as to recoverable loss
103It follows that the respondent was entitled to recover its reasonable expenditure under the following heads:

(a) removal and replacement of the retaining wall and fencing; costs of resurvey and preparation of a new s 88B instrument and linen plan; registration expenses; and
(b) cost of first Supreme Court proceedings up to 28 February 2004.

104The appellants submitted that the heads of damage contained in (a) totalled $9,910.50. However, the amounts allowed by the trial judge for these items appear to be of the order of $10,397: judgment, p 47. The correct sum can no doubt be agreed.

105With respect to (b), the appellants identified the respondent's legal costs of the first proceedings in an amount of $134,049.27. This figure appears to have been agreed after the trial.

106The respondent is not, however, entitled to recover legal costs incurred after February 2004, being the legal costs of the first proceedings from 1 March 2004 to settlement in February 2005, and the on-going disputation including the second proceedings. The figure for the first period appears to be approximately $66,000. The figure for the latter period appears to have been agreed to have totalled $153,245. The judgment must be reduced by these amounts.

107The trial judge also allowed an amount for engineering and construction works on the road, totalling $20,453. On the basis that disputes as to the construction of the road were not relevantly related to the appellants' breach of duty, except to the extent that the entitlement to lodge a caveat, flowing from that breach of duty, provided the neighbours with an opportunity to pursue their claims with respect to the road works, that amount should be disallowed on the same basis as the refusal of the costs of the second proceedings, discussed above. The judgment must be reduced accordingly.

108Finally, there was an amount allowed by the trial judge to compensate the respondent for its inability to sell the property between July 2002, for almost seven years, whilst the caveat was in place. There was a separate challenge to the allowance of that item. The trial judge accepted that the respondent had put the property on the market in July 2002 and received an offer at that time. (There was a copy of the advertisement for sale of the property in evidence.) He also accepted an estimate by a valuer that the market value of the property had decreased by approximately $50,000 between August 2002 and July 2009, when the caveat was finally removed. There is no basis to overturn those findings. Such figures are undoubtedly attended by a degree of uncertainty and his Honour discounted the amount claimed by the respondent significantly, allowing a figure of $20,000, without interest. While it may be said that, on the reasoning accepted above, the loss flowing from the breach of duty by the appellants should have ended in or shortly after February 2004, the amount in issue is not sufficient to warrant a retrial and the challenge should be dismissed.

109The trial judge allowed interest on the judgment in an amount of $136,703. That figure will need to be recalculated by the parties in the light of the adjustments noted above. 

Costs
110In broad terms, the appellants have been successful in reducing the amount of their liability in damages by approximately three-quarters. In these circumstances, it would seem appropriate that there be no order as to costs in this Court, on the basis that each party has been partly, but only partly, successful.

111With respect to the costs of the trial, the orders sought in the notice of appeal are not pellucid. It appears that there was an offer of compromise made in August 2009, probably by the respondent, given the order made by the trial judge. In the light of the orders proposed in this Court, the parties should have an opportunity to make brief submissions in respect of costs, if appropriate orders cannot be agreed.

Directions as to orders
112In the result, the appeal should be allowed in part, and the parties should be given an opportunity to bring in short minutes of orders to give effect to these reasons and in respect of costs, both in this Court and in the Court below. The Court should give the following directions:

(1) Direct the parties to file short minutes of orders within 14 days of the date of this judgment.

(2) In the event that agreement is not reached on any matter,

(a) each party is to file, within 28 days, its proposed orders and submissions in support thereof;
(b) each party may, within a further seven days, file a brief submission in reply.

(3) Any application for an extension of the times provided in these directions may be made by letter to the Associate of the presiding judge.

113YOUNG JA: I agree with Basten JA.

		18 April 2012",2012-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2708359,R v White & ors (No 8) [2012] NSWSC 472,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The Crown has closed its case, the case for the accused White has been presented and concluded, and we are halfway through the case for the accused Serone. 
2Mr Johnston, on behalf of the accused Birkensleigh, has now made an application, commonly referred to as a Prasad application.  This is a reference to R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161.   It has been said the power to invite the jury to consider returning a verdict of not guilty at any time after the close of the Crown case should be used sparingly and only where the evidence lacks cogency:  see R v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191.
3Mr Johnston has previously made an application that I direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of the charge of robbery at the close of the Crown case.  At the same time he applied for a directed verdict in respect of the charge of accessory after the fact to murder.  I acceded to the application in respect of the latter charge but not in relation to the former.  In the course of giving judgment on that occasion I referred, in brief terms, to the nature of the Crown case in relation to the robbery charge:  R v White & ors (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 470.
4The Crown case against Ms Birkensleigh is circumstantial.  It relies, in particular, upon the purchase by her of cable ties and tape to be used in a proposed robbery of the deceased.  That is a conclusion that is open to the jury to draw and, if drawn, exposes Ms Birkensleigh to potential conviction for the charge of robbery on the basis that she was an accessory before the fact. 
5Mr Johnston's submissions this morning have been to the effect that the case against the accused Birkensleigh for the robbery charge is a weak one and it would be appropriate to inform the jury of their right to return a verdict of not guilty at any stage from now.
6A Prasad invitation is most appropriate in cases where little or no explanation of the law is required; the issues are straightforward; and there is no need for there to be any detailed review of the evidence.  Such an invitation to the jury may most commonly be found in cases involving alleged personal or sexual violence, where the only evidence upon which the prosecution relies is that of the alleged victim and where there is a real issue as to whether the victim can be believed.
7In the present case, Ms Birkensleigh is one of three accused who are the subject of this trial.  This is the sixth week of the trial.  Although there has been a substantial amount of time lost because of necessary juror absences and for the Easter break, there is a considerable body of evidence that has been adduced in the course of the prosecution case and it has some complexity.  In my view it would be very difficult for the jury to fully understand, amongst that volume of evidence, what aspects of it are relied upon by the Crown on the one hand and by Ms Birkensleigh on the other in the case that concerns her.  That is to say, it would be difficult for the jury to have that understanding, absent the assistance they would be given by hearing closing addresses by counsel and a summing-up by me.
8The Crown Prosecutor has often mentioned when exhibits have been tendered as to which accused they relate, but this has not always been the case.  It has been resolved that prior to the jury retiring to consider their verdicts they will be provided with a list of all the exhibits, which will include an indication as to which accused each item is relevant.  It would be inappropriate to spend the time now isolating for the jury which exhibits and which parts of the oral evidence are admissible in relation to just one of the accused.  It would be inappropriate for addresses to be made by the Crown and counsel for the accused Birkensleigh so as to appraise the jury as to those matters and it would be similarly inappropriate for me to take the jury through the competing arguments that are available to the Crown and to counsel for the accused Birkensleigh.
9In my view, there are too many complications of the nature I have just outlined to make this a situation in which giving the jury a Prasad invitation is appropriate.  
10The application is refused.

		09 May 2012",2012-04-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708367,Lavorato v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 61,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 16 June 2009 the applicant, Mr Lavorato, appeared before Magistrate Pearce in the Local Court at Campbelltown, charged with three offences under the Liquor Act 2007 (NSW), s 11(2). (The name of the informant does not appear from the papers before this Court.) Each offence identified a failure to comply with the conditions of the licence held by the applicant as the secretary/manager of the Campbelltown Catholic Club Ltd. The offences were not committed by the applicant personally, but by staff, in serving alcohol after midnight in glass containers. The submissions for the applicant in the Local Court were that the charges should be dismissed without proceeding to conviction, pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""). The magistrate declined to take that course, convicting the applicant and fining him $600 on each count.

2On 10 July 2009, the applicant filed an appeal against sentence, pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), s 11(1). The Director of Public Prosecutions took over the proceedings in the District Court, pursuant to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW), s 9. Accordingly, the Director is the respondent in this Court. (Following a practice long predating the creation of the Director's office, the proceedings are still entitled in the name of the Queen, in Latin.)

3On 25 August 2010 the appeal against sentence was heard by Syme DCJ and was dismissed. The proceedings come to this Court by way of case stated by Syme DCJ pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In dismissing the appeal, Syme DCJ rejected the applicant's submission that he should have been dealt with under s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Her Honour was subsequently invited to state a number of questions for determination by this Court, which, if determined in the applicant's favour, would form the basis for an order quashing the judgment on the sentence appeal and remitting the matter to the District Court for determination in accordance with the answers given by this Court: s 5B(3).

4For the reasons set out below, such relief should not be granted. However, before addressing the stated questions of law, two preliminary steps must be taken. First, it is necessary to identify the procedures by which the case has been stated. Secondly, it is necessary to explain why the Court granted the applicant an extension of time within which to file the stated case. 

(1) Procedure for case stated
5There is no appeal from a decision of the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction determining an appeal from a judgment in the Local Court. Apart from judicial review pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), the only step available to an aggrieved party in the District Court is to invite the judge to submit for determination by this Court a question of law arising on the appeal to the District Court. That procedure is available under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act, which provides:

""5B Case stated from District Court

(1) A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.

(2) At the request of a person who was a party to appeal proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow.

(3) The Court of Criminal Appeal may, in connection with the determination of a question of law in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), quash any acquittal, conviction or sentence of the District Court on the appeal to the District Court.""

6The absence of any appeal from the District Court in such cases is long standing and deliberate: a case stated is not to be converted into a general right of appeal, or even one limited to error of law. Rather, the subject matter of the proceedings in this Court is identified by the questions submitted by the judge of the District Court.

7The essential step to be taken by the District Court judge, almost invariably upon the application of one party or the other, is to formulate the questions of law to be submitted. The second essential step is to identify the facts which demonstrate that the questions of law are questions ""arising on"" the appeal to the District Court. In the absence of an agreed statement of facts, it is necessary for the District Court judge to determine the facts in issue: cf Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal (No 3) [2000] HCA 49; 174 ALR 681 at [4] (Gaudron J). 

8It is clear that the powers conferred on this Court do not include making findings of fact or drawing inferences from facts found by the Court below. In those circumstances, it is curious, to the extent of being confusing, that the Criminal Appeal Rules require that the questions submitted to the Court shall be accompanied by ""a summary of the evidence and a statement showing the names of the parties and their legal representatives, if any"": r 29. The evidence is, generally speaking, irrelevant to the exercise required of this Court and should generally be ignored. On the other hand, there is no reference in the Rules to the case being accompanied by the judgment below. That is probably an historical anomaly, dating from a time when the questions had to be submitted before judgment was given.

9In relying on authorities from other jurisdictions, it is important to take into account variations in legislative schemes, which are not all identical. It is possible that the scheme in this State is affected by the applicable Rules. However, r 29 is not merely anomalous, having regard to other regimes; its purpose is unclear when read in context. It cannot vary the statutory provision for determination of a question of law.

10Although there is no reference in the Rules to submissions made by the parties below, and generally submissions will be irrelevant, there may be circumstances in which it is necessary for the case stated to identify a submission in order to demonstrate that the question said to have arisen on the appeal was in fact proffered for determination by the District Court. No issue subsequently identified by the aggrieved party, not having been proffered for determination below, can form the basis of a stated case.

11A difficulty can arise where there are discrepancies or inconsistencies between the findings of fact identified by the trial judge in the stated case and those appearing from the judgment. 

12Where a case is stated prior to delivery of a final judgment (as occurred in Muin) facts may be agreed. Generally speaking, however, where a case is stated following a final judgment it will be inappropriate for the stated case to identify findings of fact other than those identified in the judgment. In the present case, under the heading ""My findings"", the trial judge summarised the content of her judgment. That was inappropriate: all that was required (and appropriate) was to identify findings of fact made in the judgment. 

13The critical part of the case stated is the setting out of the questions of law. In the present case, six questions were identified, five of which started, ""Did I err in law in deciding that ..."". This form of question has been criticised on more than one occasion. Such a question does not identify an error of law and, indeed, will usually obscure the fact that the particular finding about which the question is asked involved mixed questions of fact and law: see Robinson v Woolworths Ltd (T/as Woolworth Plus Petrol Werrington) [2005] NSWCCA 426; 64 NSWLR 612 at [8]; Sasterawan v Morris [2007] NSWCCA 185; 69 NSWLR 547 at [15]. To ask whether a particular conclusion was ""open"" on the basis of identified facts, or to ask whether the identified facts were ""capable of supporting"" that conclusion may well constitute a question of law, which it would be appropriate for this Court to answer.

14Finally, the requirement for questions of law to be submitted to this Court within 28 days after determination of the appeal proceedings in the District Court has consequences for the process of formulating a stated case. In Talay v R [2010] NSWCCA 308, after noting the obligation of the judge to state a case on request unless frivolous (or, in the words of Jordan CJ in Ex parte McGavin; Re Berne (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 58 at 61, ""so obviously frivolous and baseless that its submission would be an abuse of process"") Simpson J said that the settling of the case involved matters of ""some considerable importance, in which the opposing party has an interest, and to which it is entitled to make a contribution"": at [11]. Howie AJ posited an obligation to inform the prosecutor of the proposed procedure and invite his or her participation, characterised as ""really a matter of procedural fairness"": at [63]. 

15The term ""procedural fairness"" is sometimes used colloquially, rather than by reference to its legal meaning. It was probably intended to be used in a practical or colloquial sense by Howie AJ in Talay, no analysis being undertaken of the statutory scheme, nor any authority being cited for the proposition that the respondent to a stated case had a right to be consulted about the form of the questions or the findings of fact to be stated. The issue need not be pursued further, except that the manner in which the draft stated case came to be submitted is relevant to the need for the applicant for an extension of time.

16It is not without significance that, until 1 March 1999, a request for a case to be stated to this Court had to be made before the District Court judge actually delivered judgment on the appeal: Justices Legislation Amendment (Appeals) Act 1998 (NSW), item 2.8[1]. Not infrequently, it was only upon hearing the reasons for judgment being delivered that one party was able to identify a supposed error of law which might be placed before this Court for its determination. There could then be an unseemly attempt to interrupt the judge before he or she delivered final orders. There was then no limit on the time for submitting the case to this Court, but that step usually occurred with little delay.

17In a practical sense, there might be much to be said for the involvement of the party other than the one applying for the case to be stated; however, in the present case, the ""contribution"" made by the Director was to lodge detailed ""submissions"", together with further objections to each variation of the draft stated case. Although there are difficulties with the form of the questions stated, no material improvement occurred after the first draft stated case was lodged with the District Court judge, exactly 28 days after the appeal to that Court was dismissed. It was no doubt unfortunate (but not uncommon) that a transcript of her Honour's judgment was not immediately available, to allow for precise identification of the findings of fact which she had made. However, that provided no excuse for what followed. 

18First, the applicant was undoubtedly at fault in failing to file the draft stated case with a request for submission to this Court within a few days of the judgment. Secondly, the adversarial approach of the Director was entirely inappropriate. If he thought that the questions needed to be reformulated, he should have given assistance in that regard by indicating what he thought would be an appropriate variation to the proposed questions in the draft stated case prepared by the applicant. Thirdly, both parties appear to have accepted the need (or at least the desirability) of waiting for the transcript of the judgment on sentence. Fourthly, significant further costs and delay must have been incurred through a series of ""mentions"" and directions hearings which then occurred before a number of judges in the District Court. That process was based on a misconception: it was a matter for the sentencing judge to determine whether she would sign or amend the draft stated case in the form in which it was submitted. At least so far as the challenge to the sentencing appeal was concerned, there was no suggestion in the material before this Court that her Honour was unavailable to perform that task, nor was there any suggestion that another judge had any involvement in the task. Given the statutory time limit, not extendable by the District Court, the judge was obliged to sign, or amend and sign the draft case expeditiously.

(2) Reasons for extending time
19The stated case was signed by the sentencing judge on 27 May 2011 and submitted to this Court on 2 June 2011. The applicant therefore needed an extension of time until 2 June 2011, being a period of a little over eight months. 

20Factors favouring the extension were:

(a) the Director did not submit that there was any prejudice suffered as a result of the delay;
(b) it was common ground between the applicant and the Director that the settling of the draft stated case should await receipt of a transcript of her Honour's reasons for judgment;
(c) the transcript of the judgment was not received until 18 January 2011;
(d) part of the delay appears to have arisen from complications due to a contemporaneous application for a stated case in relation to a separate appeal against conviction (later abandoned);
(e) the inappropriate procedure adopted in the District Court whereby timetables were set for the DPP to file objections and for the applicant to respond;
(f) a decision by the sentencing judge to ""list the matter"" (being the request to state a case) at a time when she was to be available in Sydney, and 
(g) the preliminary assessment made by the District Court on the papers of the merits of the legal issues to be determined.

21Other considerations tended against the extension sought. As the Director correctly submitted, the time period allowed under s 5B requires prompt action, not only by the applicant, but by the other party (if it is to play some role) and by the Court itself. In the present case, the applicant was undoubtedly at fault in failing to file the draft stated case within a few days of the judgment. There were also later periods when the applicant acted in weeks, rather than days. Significantly, there were (and remain) problems with the form of the questions. However, the Director was also at fault in embarking upon a series of objections which appear to have led the Court to adopt an adversarial approach to resolving issues in dispute, without resolving the infelicities in the questions. The Court itself was at fault in failing to deal with the request in a timely fashion. Each of these factors combined to result in a totally unjustifiable delay; however, because both parties were partly to blame and because the Director cannot, understandably, point to any direct prejudice flowing to the prosecution or the public interest from the delay, it was appropriate to grant the necessary extension of time.

(3) The questions
(a) question 1: penalty notices
22The first question stated for this Court was as follows:

(1) Did I err in law in deciding that the document from Tab 8 (Annexure ""A"" hereto) was admissible because of the Penalty Notices referred to therein?

23The document referred to in this question did not name the applicant, but it appears to have been common ground that it related to him. It appeared to identify his status as ""Secretary manager"" of the Campbelltown Catholic Club from 31 August 2006; it identified three offences committed by the club secretary; each involved permitting intoxication on club premises contrary to s 44A(1)(a) of the Registered Clubs Act 1976 (NSW), as in force in 2008. A person served with a ""penalty notice"" who did not wish to have the matter determined by a court, could pay the prescribed amount within the time specified by the notice: s 66. Further, s 66 made provision for the consequences of such a course in the following terms:

""66 Penalty notices
...
(4) If the amount of penalty prescribed for the purposes of this section for an alleged offence is paid under this section, no person is liable to any further proceedings for the alleged offence except proceedings under sections 17 or 17AAA.

(5) Payment under this section is not to be regarded as an admission of liability for the purpose of, nor in any way affect or prejudice, any civil proceeding arising out of the same occurrence.

(6) However, when a penalty is paid under this section in respect of a penalty notice served on a person, the person is for the purposes of sections 17 and 17AAA taken to have been convicted of the offence to which the penalty notice related.
...
(9) This section does not limit the operation of any other provision of, or made under, this or any other Act relating to proceedings that may be taken in respect of offences.""

24Despite the fact that the document in question expressly referred to the Registered Clubs Act as the authority under which the penalty notices were issued in respect of the three offences to which it referred, the submissions in this Court addressed a similar scheme for penalty notices arising under the Liquor Act, s 150. Although the wording of the two provisions was similar in many respects, there were two potentially significant variants which needed to be considered. The first was that each applied to an offence under the Act in which it appeared. That would have required comparison between the offence under the Registered Clubs Act in respect of which the notices were issued and any analogous offence under the Liquor Act, which had not been invoked in relation to the applicant in 2008. Secondly, the deemed conviction provision in s 66(6) may serve a different purpose to that found in s 150(7) of the Liquor Act. These differences were not addressed.

25The form of the question is opaque as to the point of law sought to be raised. Indeed, when considering questions of admissibility, it will usually be necessary to identify with some particularity the objection taken to the evidence and the basis of the ruling on that objection. From the relevant finding of fact identified in the stated case it may be inferred that there was an objection and that it was based on relevance, the District Court judge stating that she had found ""that a Penalty Notice addressed to Mr Lavorato had been paid was relevant to the sentencing of Mr Lavorato"": par 2.2. The stated case also referred to the provisions of s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in respect of which findings were made that the applicant ""was a person of good character, and high moral character"" and that ""the penalty notices that were issued against him previously ... would [not] alter that standing within the community"": par 2.10. The question of relevance thus related to the central issue raised by the applicant in the District Court, namely that he should be dealt with pursuant to s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That provision, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

""10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender

(1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders:

(a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed,
(b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years ....
...
(3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors:

(a) the person's character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition,
(b) the trivial nature of the offence,
(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,
(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.""

26Although the applicant conceded that he had paid the penalty notices in question, that did not mean, he submitted, that he had a conviction in respect of those offences. The reference in s 10(3)(a) to ""character"" and ""antecedents"" could not, as a matter of law, extend to charges for which he had not been convicted.

27The materiality of that issue in the District Court was somewhat obscure, given the findings that he was of good character and that the payment of the penalty notices did not affect his character.

28The inapt formulation of this question illustrates the difficulties which this Court can face where it must, in effect, identify for itself the question of law raised. A reference to a penalty notice could have been relevant for the purposes of s 10(3)(a) as evidence of the applicant's ""antecedents"", a term with a meaning once described as being ""as wide as can be conceived"": R v Vallett [1951] 1 All ER 231 at 232 (Lord Goddard CJ), referred to in Jones v Morley (1981) 29 SASR 57 at 63-65, in a passage adopted by Spigelman CJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky [2001] NSWCCA 332; 164 FLR 375 at [27]. Nor was that the sole basis upon which the material might have been admitted: s 10(3)(d) permitted the Court to consider ""any other matter"" which it thought proper, language which, though not without implied limitations, is not readily constrained as a matter of law.

29To answer the question favourably to the applicant in these circumstances is not possible. To answer the question at all is to require reformulation so as to identify a particular statutory term as the basis of admissibility, being a basis on which the question arose in the proceedings in the District Court. As the only relevance attached to the document, so far as may be inferred from the stated case, related to the applicant's character, as to which no adverse inference was drawn, there is no purpose in pursuing this issue further. The appropriate response to the question must be, ""Inappropriate to answer"".

(b) question 2: effect of conviction on standing within community
30The second question identified in the stated case was as follows:

(2) Did I err in law in deciding that in the exercise of my discretion in s 10 [of the Sentencing Procedure Act] that Mr Lavorato's standing within the community would not be affected by convictions for the offences?

31This question raised, if possible, even greater difficulties than the first question. It identified no question of law. The phrase ""standing within the community"" was used by the sentencing judge in assessing the effect of proceeding to conviction, rather than dealing with the matter under s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in determining that the conviction would not affect his status as a person of good character or ""high moral character"". The phrase has no significance as a legal criterion identified in the statute. The finding made by the sentencing judge was not even, properly understood, an exercise of discretionary power, but an evaluative judgment made in the course of determining not to exercise the statutory power under s 10. 

32Question (2), therefore, does not identify any question of law which it is appropriate to answer. Because no step has been taken to set aside the stated case, generally or in relation to this question, the appropriate response to the question is, ""Inappropriate to answer"".

(c) question 3: relevant considerations
33Question 3 had two parts, the second of which at least gave rise to a possible question of law. The question was in the following form:

(3) Did I err in law in deciding that each of the circumstances in para 2.10(3)(a)-(c) were

(a) for the purposes of s 10(3)(c) of the [Sentencing Procedure Act], not extenuating circumstances in which the offence by Mr Lavorato occurred; or
(b) for the purposes of s 10(3)(d) of the [Sentencing Procedure Act], matters that I might properly consider?

34The circumstances identified in paragraph 2.10(3) of the stated case were as follows:

""2.10 I then proceeded to consider the provisions of s 10 [of the Sentencing Procedure Act] and made the following findings:

...
(3) none of the following were 'extenuating circumstances'

(a) Mr Lavorato's position within the Club, 
(b) the short interval between the commencement of Sch 4 to the Liquor Act, and the offence of [sic] the offences charged, 
(c) that the offences occurred because of a mistake rather than a deliberate attempt to flout the law,

because the offences were

(d) offences of strict liability, 
(e) for regulatory type matters unless there is a salutary type punishment there is really no deterrent effect of any penalty.""

35Reading the question as a whole, it is apparent that her Honour took into account each of the factors identified for the purposes of the question, but did not characterise them as ""extenuating circumstances"", in the sense presumably of circumstances which would materially support proceeding under s 10. There will be an error of law if the Court took into account a consideration which, either expressly or by implication, it was forbidden to consider in exercising the sentencing power. The applicant did not suggest that the identified factors were in that legal sense impermissible. Further, because the sentencing judge in fact took them into account, no question arose as to whether or not they were mandatory considerations. Accordingly, the question which appears to have been intended was whether her Honour erred in law in characterising them as matters which could be taken into account under par (d) of s 10(3), rather than, as the applicant submitted, extenuating circumstances under par (c). However, that analysis would give rise to an error of law only if the factors could only be characterised as extenuating circumstances, no other characterisation being open.

36That submission was untenable. Whatever was meant by the reference to Mr Lavorato's ""position within the Club"", his role as licensee was an essential element of the offence. The reference to Sch 4 of the Liquor Act, and its time of commencement, involved a number of factual assumptions. One was that, prior to its commencement, there had been no prohibition on serving a drink ""in a glass or breakable plastic container"" after midnight - Liquor Act, Sch 4, cl 4(1) - and that the ""short interval"" (referred to in the findings as one month) was material in respect of the failure to comply. Finally, the characterisation of the offences as ""a mistake"" (presumably meaning a mistake, in each case) rather than a deliberate attempt to flout the law, in respect of an offence of strict liability, must be held to be material in favour of an exercise of the power under s 10.

37How these factors were to be treated was entirely a matter to be determined by the sentencing judge. While s 10(3) identified what might be described as mandatory factors, where they were known, the language was otherwise not directory, let alone preclusive, in respect of the facts which might need to be assessed in considering those factors. It did not require that particular facts be assessed in any particular way. No error of law was identified in respect of question 3. 

(d) questions 4 and 5: steps taken to achieve compliance
38It is convenient to deal, as the applicant did, jointly with questions 4 and 5. They were stated in the following terms:

(4) Did I err in law in deciding that:

(1) the issue of whether Mr Lavorato had or had not taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could to obtain compliance by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences, 

(2) was not an issue relevant to:

(a) whether the offences might properly be dealt with under s 10(1)(a) [of the Sentencing Procedure Act], or
(b) the sentencing of Mr Lavorato for the offences upon conviction for them?

(5) Alternatively to [(4)] above, did I err in law in failing to decide the issue in [4(1)] above?

39The alternative form of these questions is partly explained by the ""findings"" set out in the case stated at paragraph 2. In particular, at 2.9, her Honour stated:

""I made no finding about whether Mr Lavorato had or had not taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could to obtain compliance with the condition by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences.""

40The distinction between questions 4 and 5 revealed an elision in the stated case. Question 5 could not give rise to a question of law unless the reason for the failure was identified. For example, if no relevant evidence is tendered, it could not be an error of law to fail to make a finding. Paragraph 2.9 did not indicate why her Honour made no finding. On the other hand, implicit within question 4 was the proposition that evidence pertaining to the issue had been tendered, but had been disregarded as irrelevant as a matter of law. There was no finding to that effect, except by implication from question 4, which was inconsistent with the implication to be derived from question 5. A further possibility, not adverted to in the findings, was that the evidence was insufficient to allow a finding one way or the other. 

41More importantly, the question is framed in a way which involves an inference to be drawn from other facts. The inference itself was not, in its terms, a mandatory consideration. No doubt it was a permissible consideration and, to the extent that the evidence permitted, it would have been appropriate for the sentencing judge to make findings with respect to such aspects of the steps taken by the licensee to obtain compliance with the licence conditions and to make an assessment as to whether more could be done. If the relevant evidence had been assessed, the failure to make a finding in the terms adopted in the question would not constitute an error of law. Indeed, unless a finding in those terms was specifically sought, it is arguable that such a question did not arise at all for the purposes of the sentencing hearing.

42To the extent that it is permissible for this Court to look beyond the finding set out in the case stated, to the judgment of the District Court, the following passages may be noted. First, at p 5, her Honour stated:

""I have read the statement of the appellant in these proceedings and take all those matters into account. The fact that it is a very large club with a large number of employees that trades 363 days a year is an important consideration but it is an important consideration in two competing areas. Firstly, because it is a large club with a large presence in the community it has a very high obligation to comply with all of the Licensing Act requirements and a very high obligation to make sure that any licensing requirements are assiduously complied with by it. On the other hand I acknowledge that because of its size and because of the number of employees strict compliance in very many ways is obviously going to be very difficult. These are competing considerations.""

43Her Honour then turned to consider the timing of the offences in respect of the imposition of the licence condition and continued (p 6-7):

""In terms of the objective seriousness of each of those particular offences: in relation to each offence it was a single breach. In relation to each offence the alcohol was served in the original bottle rather than poured out into a glass. And in relation to each offence it appears clear that there was a general directive to staff not to do what they had done and for reasons relating to either the hour or sheer mistake the staff who usually complied did not comply on these three separate occasions on that particular day. Therefore in terms of objective seriousness of the offence this is an offence towards the lower end of the scale in relation to this particular type of breach.

...

The other thing the Court takes into account are the subjective circumstances. The appellant is the executive officer of this club. He was not in attendance on that particular night and there is no requirement that he actually be in attendance for all of the times that the club is operating as I understand it. His statement sets out a management structure and also attaches a staff handbook. All of those things appear to be very proper and very properly managed by the club. There are details in his statement of compliance with the responsible service of alcohol principles and I have no argument with respect to those matters and they all appear to be perfectly well managed. There was some observation ... in relation to the lack of signage in relation to plastic containers. But that is a matter that I consider to be of less importance than anything else. There is no suggestion in this case that this was anything but an oversight or a mistake. I have also had a look at the staff training handbook. Such a handbook is a necessary part of such an organisation.""

44These statements in the reasons suggest that such evidence as was before the Court was taken into account. Even by reference to the judgment, the case stated does not demonstrate that there was any evidence before her Honour to the effect that no other step could reasonably have been taken in order to obtain compliance. On one view, accordingly, it might be appropriate to answer question 4 (or question 5) in the negative. However, the inadequacies in the form of the questions and the absence of sufficient findings, leaving some doubt as to what in fact was decided, render the better response, ""Inappropriate to answer"".

(e) question 6: strict liability offences
45The final question was in the following form:

(6) Did I err in law in deciding that the object of imposing strict liability for regulatory type offences would not be achieved in the absence of a conviction and the imposition of a penalty ie by then being dealt with under s 10(1)(a) [of the Sentencing Procedure Act]?

46Problems of a different kind arise in relation to this formulation. However, as it appeared from the applicant's submissions, the inference said to be drawn from her Honour's judgment was that, as a matter of law, s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act could have no application in relation to a ""regulatory type offence"" involving strict liability.

47Whilst this approach might give rise to a question of law, it is not consistent with the findings in the case stated, which included a finding for the purpose of s 10(3)(b) that the offences were ""not trivial"": paragraph 2.10(2). That finding, together with the findings of 2.10(3) set out above, are simply inconsistent with the proposition that her Honour determined that s 10 could have no operation in relation to an offence of this kind. She considered factors which were relevant only on the basis that the provision could apply. She stated, in rejecting the extenuating circumstances relied upon by the applicant, that ""this is an offence of strict liability and of course even for regulatory type of matters unless there is a salutary punishment in relation to non-compliance then there is really no deterrent effect of any penalty"": judgment, p 8. In short, her Honour thought that a conviction and penalty were necessary ""as a matter of specific and general deterrence"" by way of changing the attitude of leadership and licensees: p 9. 

48It is tolerably clear from the reasons given that there was no blanket rejection of the applicability of s 10 to offences of the kind in question, but rather a finding that, in the circumstances of the particular case, it was not appropriate to proceed under s 10. The question of law apparently sought to be raised by question 6 was based on a false premise. Even if that fact could not properly be established by reference to the reasons for judgment, the ambiguity within the question would be sufficient to require the response, ""Inappropriate to answer"".

(4) Conclusions
49In the circumstances set out above, each of the questions raised should be answered ""Inappropriate to answer"", except question 3, which should be answered ""No"". Because the effect of these answers is to find no error of law in the approach adopted by the District Court, there is no further order necessary in respect of the judgment below.

50There is a further question with respect to the costs of these proceedings. Because the procedure under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act is not the hearing or determination of ""an appeal"" the prohibition on orders for costs contained in s 17 does not apply. The Director sought costs in his written submission: par 41. Although the applicant filed a reply, he did not deal with this issue. However, in the course of oral argument, counsel for the applicant accepted that costs could be ordered, in the discretion of the Court: Tcpt, 10/02/12, p 14(28).

51In this case considerable effort was devoted to resisting the extension of time, consistently with the adversarial approach adopted by the Director in respect of the statement of the case whilst the proceeding was still in the District Court. Although the applicant has been unsuccessful in obtaining the answers sought to the questions, he was successful in obtaining an extension of time. In the circumstances, the preferable course is to make no order as to the costs of the proceedings on the stated case.

52RS HULME J: In this matter, I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Basten JA and Schmidt J. I agree with the criticism both their Honours make of the stated case procedure.

53I also agree with the first three paragraphs of Schmidt J's reasons.

54My responses to the specific questions raised in the stated case are as follows.

Question 3.1

55I agree with Schmidt J that this question should be answered, no. I agree generally with her Honour's reasons.

Question 3.2

56My answer to this question is no. The decision referred to in the question was, as Basten JA has observed, an evaluative judgment and not one which amounts to a decision on a question of law. Thus, Syme DCJ did not ""err in law"".

Question 3.3

57The terms of this question were:-

Did I err in law in deciding that each of the circumstances in para 2.10(3)(a) - (c) were:

(a) for the purposes of s 10(3)(c) C(SP)A, not extenuating circumstances in which the offence by Mr Lavorato occurred; or

(b) for the purposes of s 10(3)(d) C(SP)A, matters that I might properly consider?

58So far as sub-paragraph (a) is concerned, I would answer this question, yes, and, subject to one matter, for the reasons given by Schmidt J in arriving at the same conclusion.

59The reservation referred to concerns the statement in [108] to the effect that Syme DCJ was obliged to determine whether the circumstances in paragraph 2.10(3)(a) - (c) were ""extenuating circumstances"". A judicial officer asked in an application to employ s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to take into account a particular fact or circumstance does not have to decide into which the sub-paragraph of s 10(3) that fact or circumstance falls.

60So far as sub-paragraph (b) of Question 3.3 is concerned, it is not apparent to me from either the judgment of her Honour or in the factual findings set out in paragraphs 2.1 - 2.12 of the stated case that her Honour made a decision in the terms reflected in this part of the question. That said, her Honour's reasons for her decision the subject of Question 3.3(a) were expressed in terms wide enough to indicate she probably took a similar view in respect of the matters arising under s10(3)(d) as she did in respect of matters arising under s 10(3)(c).

61My response to Question 3.3(b) is, inappropriate to answer.

Question 3.4 and 3.5

62I agree with Schmidt J that these questions should be answered, yes. I agree with her Honour's reasons for these conclusions.

Question 3.6

63I agree with Schmidt J that this question should be answered, yes. I agree with her Honour's reasons for this conclusion.

64SCHMIDT J: I have had the benefit of reading Basten JA's reasons, but find myself in disagreement with his Honour's conclusions. 

65In my view the questions posed in the stated case are not disguised attempts to exercise a right of appeal, of the kind discussed in Castlebar Holding Pty Ltd v Riley [2005] NSWCCA 105. Nor do they require reformulation, which must be guarded against, as Spigelman CJ discussed in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Limited v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 367 at [81].

66The stated case raises questions of law which are relevant to the conviction of the applicant of the offences to which he entered pleas; to the proper construction of s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and of s 11(2) of the Liquor Act 2007. In my view, while the questions posed have not been framed as clearly as they might have been, they must still be answered, consistently with the pragmatic approach adopted by the High Court in Thomas v R [1937] HCA 83; (1937) 59 CLR 279. 

The need for law reform

67The case was stated under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act which provides:

""5B Case stated from District Court
(1) A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.
(2) At the request of a person who was a party to appeal proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow.
(3) The Court of Criminal Appeal may, in connection with the determination of a question of law in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), quash any acquittal, conviction or sentence of the District Court on the appeal to the District Court.""

68The difficulties raised by the stated case procedure have been the subject of repeated comment by this and other courts and are discussed again by Basten JA. These are not new observations. In Collins v State Rail Authority of NSW (1986) 5 NSWLR 209, for example, Street CJ described the process at 211 as:

""... a cumbersome and often unsatisfactory means of bringing a matter up for consideration on appeal ... fraught with difficulties ...""

69The passage of time has not cured these difficulties. What occurred in this case amply reveals the problems which the process still tends to create. As Simpson J discussed in Talay v R [2010] NSWCCA 308 at [11]:

""Although, unless a question of law proposed to be submitted is frivolous, a judge is obliged on request to state a case to this court (see Director of Public Prosecutions v Cassell (1995) 80 A Crim R 160 at 164-165, citing Ex parte McGavin; Re Byrne (1945) 46 SR (NSW) 58), the settling of the stated case, including the statement of facts found, and the question (or questions) submitted for determination, are a matter of some considerable importance, in which the opposing party has an interest, and to which it is entitled to make a contribution.""

70While the principles which ought to be followed when stating a case are well settled, that they are difficult to implement has also been repeatedly discussed. The process very plainly raises unnecessary difficulties for both the parties involved and for the judicial officers obliged to adhere to it. The result in practical terms is that stating a case cannot always be achieved in the time frame which the statute contemplates. 

71It is long settled that this Court may not have regard to matters outside the stated case, in answering the questions which are posed. Thus the importance placed on the framing of the stated case put before this Court. In this case, despite the trial judge having heard both parties, stating the facts, which in her opinion dictated her conclusions, in the form of a document with numbered paragraphs, as the applicable practice requires, appending her judgment to the stated case and posing what she considered to be questions of law, still before this Court the parties debated whether both the facts which her Honour had identified truly reflected the conclusions, which she had reached in her judgment and whether the questions of law posed, were questions of law which could be answered. 

72Basten JA's explanations of the steps which the parties pursued to have the case stated, and the difficulties and delays which were encountered, underscores how cumbersome, unwieldy and in my view, ultimately unjust and unnecessarily expensive the stated case process remains today. It appears to be the antithesis of the current drive in this State in the civil sphere, to ensure that parties have access to quick, cheap justice. 

73Given what the stated case process requires and the costs which it necessarily involves, it is entirely understandable that the parties and the judge required to state the case would wish to have access to the transcript and the judgment which has generated the stated case application, before finally stating the case. Delays inevitably result when such material is not readily available. Both parties are entitled to be heard on the questions to be posed in the stated case. Ultimately, it is for the judge stating the case to settle the terms of the case which is stated. 

74Given the burden which is imposed on the judge called upon to state the case and the difficulties which repeatedly result from the way in which stated cases are framed, as is also amply discussed in the authorities and again by Basten JA in this case, it seems to me surprising that the stated case process has not already received the legislature's attention. The current process does not appear to be consistent with what it has been recognised in the civil sphere, that the requirements of justice demand. 

75It seems to me, in these circumstances, that the difficulties which the process repeatedly creates for the criminal justice system and the expense and delays which it generates, are matters which could profitably receive the consideration of the legislature or perhaps of the Law Reform Commission.

The proceedings below

76The applicant was charged with three strict liability offences under s 11(2) of the Liquor Act 2007. He was the secretary manager of the Campbelltown Catholic Club. The offences involved the applicant's failure as licensee, to comply with a condition of the Club's license, which required that during a restricted service period, drinks not be served in a glass or breakable plastic container. The offences were described below as 'vicarious liability' offences under the Liquor Act, because they involved failures by employees of the Club to ensure that the Club's policies, which were designed to ensure that this licence condition was adhered to, were met. They did not involve a direct breach of the licence condition by the applicant himself.

77In the Local Court the applicant entered a plea and made an application under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that the charges be dismissed without proceeding to conviction. The s 10 application was refused and the applicant was convicted and fined $600 for each offence. He appealed to the District Court under s 11(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  Syme DCJ dismissed the appeal, rejecting the applicant's case that he should have been dealt with under s 10. 

The extension of time

78An application for a case to be stated to this Court was later made under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act, but not within the applicable 28 day time limit. Basten JA has explained the circumstances in which an extension of time to file the application was granted. The application was opposed by the Crown, even though it conceded that no prejudice would flow from the grant of the extension. My reasons for the extension granted at the hearing were as follows.

79The application for the stated case was made to Syme DCJ within 28 days. The applicant provided her Honour with a draft stated case at a time when neither the transcript of the proceedings, nor her Honour's judgment were available. It took months for the facts in issue and the questions to be stated to be settled by Syme DCJ. As Basten JA explains, both parties and her Honour contributed to the time taken before the application was filed in this Court. In large part the delays were the result of the need to await the transcript and for her Honour to be able to hear the parties, given the Crown's opposition to what the applicant proposed, before settling the stated case. 

80That delay was unfortunate, but it was clearly the result of the nature of the stated case process, which does not permit the trial judge to simply put the judgment out of which the stated case arises, before this Court and requires, in the case of dispute, that the parties be heard as to both the framing of the factual findings and the questions to be stated. 

81In this case, even when the matter came before this Court, there were still disagreements between the parties as to the accuracy of the facts Syme DCJ had identified as having been found in her judgment, her Honour's grounds for the conclusions she had reached and the form of the questions which had been posed. In its written submissions, the Crown addressed its 'objections' to the form of the stated case, which was submitted to contain various errors and deficiencies. Given that the stated case process does not give a defendant a right of appeal to this Court from the trial judge's determination of the factual findings and the questions of law which are to be stated, that debate carried with it a certain futility. As Basten JA discussed in Sasterawan v Morris [2007] NSWCCA 185; (2007) 69 NSWLR 547, s 5B does not 'authorise this Court to determine any questions of fact or to draw factual inferences. This Court is constrained to act on the facts as stated by the District Court'.

82Nevertheless, in the circumstances, it was apparent to me that as a matter of justice, the extension of time sought had to be granted.

The questions stated

83The questions which her Honour stated were:

3.1 Did I err in law in deciding that the document from Tab 8 (annexure ""A"" hereto) was admissible because of the Penalty Notices referred to therein?

3.2 Did I err in law in deciding that in the exercise of my discretion in s.10 C(SP)A that Mr Lavorato's standing within the community would not be affected by convictions for the Offences?

3.3 Did I err in law in deciding that each of the circumstances in para 2.10(3)(a)-(c) were

(a) for the purposes of s.10(3)(c) C(SP)A, not extenuating circumstances in which the offence by Mr Lavorato occurred; or

(b) for the purposes of s.10(3)(d) C(SP)A, matters that I might properly consider?

3.4 Did I err in law in deciding that

(1) the issue of whether Mr Lavorato had or had not taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could to obtain compliance by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences, 

(2) was not an issue relevant to:

(a) whether the Offences might properly be dealt with under s10(1)(a C(SP)A, or

(b) the sentencing of Mr Lavorato for the Offences upon conviction for them?

3.5 Alternatively to 3.4 above, did I err in law in failing to decide the issue in 3.4(1) above?

3.6 Did I err in law in deciding that the object of imposing strict liability for regulatory type offences would not be achieved in the absence of a conviction and the imposition of a penalty i.e. by then being dealt with under s10(1)(a) C(SP)A?

The factual findings 

84The factual findings were shortly stated. It is convenient to quote them:

""2.1 I began my reasons by identifying the appeal before me as a severity appeal and referring to the matters in 1.5 above.

2.2 I gave my reasons for admitting the document from Tab 8. In essence I held that the fact that a Penalty Notice addressed to Mr Lavorato had been paid was relevant to the sentencing of Mr Lavorato.

2.3 I then dealt with the admissibility of other evidence in respect of which I am not asked to submit any question of law.

2.4 On the substantive matter before me I found the relevant background to be as follows

(1) on the date in question the Club was in breach of the condition of its licence as alleged in the CAN,

(2) Mr Lavorato was then its secretary and thus its chief executive officer thus its responsible licensee,

(3) the Club is the largest licensed venue in the Macarthur region with 50,000 members and 350 full time and casual employees,

(4) in the circumstances in (3) above, gave rise to competing considerations, 

(a) the Club had a very high obligation to comply with all Liquor Act requirements, but 

(b) achieving that outcome would be very difficult.

(5) the condition the breach of which was the subject of the charges had 

(a) come into effect only a month or so prior to the occurrence of those offences, and

(b) as its object the elimination of a means of potential injury to persons at the Club.

2.5 In respect of the objective seriousness of the offence, I found that 

(1) each offence was a single offence,

(2) the alcohol had been supplied in its original bottle rather than poured into a glass,

(3) there had been a general directive to staff not to do what they did,

(4) the staff who engaged the subject of the charges,

(a) for reasons relating to the hour or sheer mistake did not do so on these occasions, but

(b) usually complied with the condition.

2.6 Having regard to the above and taking into account the potential consequence of the conduct charged, I concluded the offences were towards the lower end of the scale.

2.7 I found relevant subjective considerations as follows

(1) Mr Lavorato was not at the Club on the particular night and was not required that he actually be in attendance at that time,

(2) the management structure and staff handbook were very proper and very properly managed,

(3) the Club appeared to manage its ""responsible service of alcohol"" duties well,

(4) there was some evidence in the document in Tab 13 of a du(sic) lack of some signage on the Club's premises, but there was no suggestion in that evidence of anything but an oversight or mistake. I considered this evidence to be of less importance that(sic) anything else.

2.8 I then considered the importance of deterrence for the matter before me and

(1) concluded that on the matter of general deterrence it seemed rather pointless to punish Mr Lavorato personally, but 

(2) the position was different on the issue of specific deterrence because a chief executive officer must show leadership and a change in attitude within the organisation must change from the top,

(3) a penalty imposed on its chief executive officer is something the Club would take into account in how it deals with matters of this nature.

For the above reasons considerations of general and specific deterrence were matters I would take into account in sentencing Mr Lavorato for the offences before me.

2.9 I made no finding about whether Mr Lavorato had or had not taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could to obtain compliance with the condition by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences.

2.10 I then proceeded to consider the provisions of s. 10 C(SP)A and made the following findings

(1) Mr Lavorato was a person of good character, and high moral character.

Neither the penalty notices that were issued against him previously nor a conviction on the matters before me would alter that standing within the community,

(2) the offence(sic) for which he had pleaded guilty were not trivial,

(3) none of the following were ""extenuating circumstances""

(a) Mr Lavorato's position within the Club,

(b) the short interval between the commencement of Sch 4 to the Liquor Act, and the offence of the offences charged,

(c) that the offences occurred because of a mistake rather than a deliberate attempt to flout the law,

because the offences were

(d) offences of strict liability,

(e) for regulatory type matters unless there is a salutary type punishment there is really no deterrent effect of any penalty.

2.11 I then restated my conclusions and concluded that charges before me were not a proper matter do(sic) deal with under s.10 C(SP)A.

2.12 On that basis and having regard to the 

(1) maximum penalty that could be imposed for each offence, fifty penalty units ($5,500), and

(2) the plea of guilty,

I concluded a $600 penalty for each matter was quite proper. For those reasons I dismissed the appeal.""

Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 2010

85The section provides:
""10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender
(1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders: 
(a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed,
(b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years,
(c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program.
(2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied: 
(a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or
(b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond.
(2A) An order referred to in subsection (1) (c) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person.
(2B) Subsection (1) (c) is subject to Part 8C.
(3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors: 
(a) the person's character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition,
(b) the trivial nature of the offence,
(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,
(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.
(4) An order under this section has the same effect as a conviction: 
(a) for the purposes of any law with respect to the revesting or restoring of stolen property, and
(b) for the purpose of enabling a court to give directions for compensation under Part 4 of the Victims Compensation Act 1996, and
(c) for the purpose of enabling a court to give orders with respect to the restitution or delivery of property or the payment of money in connection with the restitution or delivery of property.
(5) A person with respect to whom an order under this section is made has the same right to appeal on the ground that the person is not guilty of the offence as the person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence.""

Question 3.1 - Did I err in law in deciding that the document from Tab 8 (Annexure ""A"" hereto) was admissible because of the Penalty Notices referred to therein?

86The document was annexed to the stated case. It identified that the applicant had earlier been fined in relation to three penalty notices issued under s 44A(1) of the Registered Clubs Act 1976. Syme DCJ noted at 2.2 of the findings of fact that she had 'held that the fact that a Penalty Notice addressed to Mr Lavorato had been paid was relevant to the sentencing of Mr Lavorato'.

87The document had been tendered without objection in the Local Court. By s 17 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review ) Act 2001, the appeal in the District Court was by way of 'rehearing of the evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings'. It follows that the admissibility of the document did not strictly arise before Syme DCJ, but, nevertheless, the question was raised and thus determined by her Honour. 

88The question of the admissibility of the document was a question of law. If the document was relevant to the issues which arose to be determined in the proceedings, it was admissible in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995.

89The applicant relied on s 150(2) of the Liquor Act, which provides:
""150 Penalty notices
(1) In this section: 
authorised officer means a police officer or an inspector.
(2) An authorised officer may serve a penalty notice on a person (including a licensee) if it appears to the officer that the person has committed an offence under this Act or the regulations and the offence is one that is prescribed by the regulations to be an offence to which this section applies.
(3) A penalty notice is a notice to the effect that, if the person served does not wish to have the matter determined by a court, the person may pay within a time and to a person specified in the notice the amount of penalty prescribed by the regulations for the offence if dealt with under this section.
(4) A penalty notice may be served personally or by post.""

90For the applicant it was argued that the payment of a penalty notice did not amount to a conviction for the purposes of offence proceedings under the Liquor Act. Payment of a penalty under the relevant administrative arrangements avoided the invocation of the criminal justice system. The payment prevented the pursuit of criminal proceedings and did not amount to an admission of guilt. That was particularly relevant in this case, where the offences later charged, in respect of which the s 10 application was made, were vicarious liability offences. It followed, it was submitted, that the penalty notices were not 'antecedents' for the purpose of s 10(3)(a) and should not have been admitted.

91Those submissions may not be accepted. The penalty notices had been issued under the Registered Clubs Act, in relation to offences alleged to have been committed in February and May 2008. That Act then provided:
""66 Penalty notices
(1) An authorised officer may serve a penalty notice on a person (including a registered club) if it appears to the officer that the person has committed an offence against this Act or the regulations and the offence is one that is stated by the regulations to be an offence to which this section applies.
(2) A penalty notice is a notice to the effect that, if the person served does not wish to have the matter determined by a court, the person may pay within a time and to a person specified in the notice the amount of penalty prescribed by the regulations for the offence if dealt with under this section.
(3) A penalty notice may be served personally or by post.
(4) If the amount of penalty prescribed for the purposes of this section for an alleged offence is paid under this section, no person is liable to any further proceedings for the alleged offence except proceedings under section 17 or 17AAA.
(5) Payment under this section is not to be regarded as an admission of liability for the purpose of, nor in any way affect or prejudice, any civil proceeding arising out of the same occurrence.
(6) However, when a penalty is paid under this section in respect of a penalty notice served on a person, the person is for the purposes of sections 17 and 17AAA taken to have been convicted of the offence to which the penalty notice related.
(7) The regulations may: 
(a) prescribe an offence for the purposes of this section by specifying the offence or by referring to the provision creating the offence, and
(b) prescribe the amount of penalty payable for the offence if dealt with under this section, and
(c) prescribe different amounts of penalties for different offences or classes of offences.
(8) The amount of a penalty prescribed under this section for an offence must not exceed the maximum amount of penalty which could be imposed for the offence by a court.
(9) This section does not limit the operation of any other provision of, or made under, this or any other Act relating to proceedings that may be taken in respect of offences.
(10) In this section: 
authorised officer means a police officer, the Director or a special inspector.""

92Section 17 of the Registered Clubs Act dealt with various types of complaints made against registered clubs and their secretaries and s 17AAA with the power of the Licensing Court to make a declaration in relation to a person against whom a complaint was made under s 17(2)(f), as to their eligibility to ""stand for election or to be appointed to, or to hold office in, the position of secretary or member of the governing body"" of the Club. The effect of s 66(6) was that payment of a penalty by a secretary, such as the applicant, had the result that the secretary was taken to have been convicted of the offence to which the penalty notice related, for proceedings brought under s 17 or s 17AAA. It did not have that same effect for any other purpose.

93It does not follow from this provision, however, that the fact that penalties had been paid by the applicant in relation to alleged offences under the Registered Clubs Act, was irrelevant to the matters which arose for consideration, when he made an application under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in relation to the offences here in question. 

94In resisting that application, the Crown was entitled to rely on the document, because it was unquestionably relevant to a consideration under s10(3)(a) of the applicant's 'antecedents', a term which has the wide meaning Basten JA discussed at [28]. Payment of the penalties was also arguably relevant to an assessment of the applicant's 'character' under s 10(3)(a). It may also have been received as a matter 'proper to consider' in determining the application, as provided by s 10(3)(d). It follows that the document was admissible, as her Honour concluded.

95It follows that this question should be answered no.

Question 3.2 - Did I err in law in deciding that in the exercise of my discretion in s.10 C(SP)A that Mr Lavorato's standing within the community would not be affected by convictions for the offences?

96The facts stated by her Honour were:

""2.10 I then proceeded to consider the provisions of s. 10 C(SP)A and made the following findings

(1) Mr Lavorato was a person of good character, and high moral character.

Neither the penalty notices that were issued against him previously nor a conviction on the matters before me would alter that standing within the community,

(2) the offence(sic) for which he had pleaded guilty were not trivial,""

97The Crown's case was that her Honour's finding that the applicant was a person of good character and of high moral character and that his standing in the community would not be affected by convictions of the offences in question, rested on character references written after conviction of the offences the subject of the appeal. In the absence of evidence that the applicant's standing in the community might be affected by conviction of those offences, or that some adverse consequences would flow from that conviction, those findings were open and involved no error of law. The applicant's case was that those conclusions rested on a fundamental misunderstanding of s 10.

98Section 4(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that '[t]he penalty to be imposed for an offence is to be the penalty provided by or under this or any other Act or law.' The maximum penalty for the offences with which the applicant was charged under s 11(2) of the Liquor Act was 100 penalty units ($5,500) or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. The order which the applicant sought to have made under s 10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that the charges be dismissed, was one of the various 'non custodial orders' specified as being available to be imposed upon the applicant under Part 2, Division 3 of that Act.

99It was not in issue that on the face of the section, an application under s 10 was available to the applicant. By the express terms of the section, it is apparent that such an application is available to be made by anyone found guilty of any offence. Once such an application has been made, it must be heard and determined on the evidence led by the parties, in the ordinary way, with the onus falling on the applicant for the order to establish circumstances warranting the exercise of the discretion in their favour.

100The purpose of s 10 is that discussed in Regina v Van Nam Nguyen [2002] NSWCCA 183 at [50]. It reflects 'the willingness of the legislature, and thus the community, to provide to first offenders, in certain circumstances, a second chance to maintain a reputation of good character'.

101The view that conviction of a particular type of offence will not affect a person's standing in the community, with the result that an application to be dealt with under s 10 ought not to be entertained, is directly inconsistent with the legislative purpose underpinning the enactment of s 10 in the wide terms in which it has been cast. 

102The section gives every sentencing judge the power to dismiss any criminal charge, even though the applicant has been found guilty of the offence in question, if a case be made out in accordance with the matters specified in s 10(3). If such a case be established on the merits, an order under s 10 should follow, so that the applicant can receive the benefit which the section is designed to achieve, namely a chance to maintain their reputation of good character, which the section recognises will be lost upon conviction of an offence. 

103A refusal to entertain an application made under s 10, because of a view that conviction of a particular type of offence, will not have the consequences which the section is designed to deal with, is not a matter of the exercise of a discretion given by the section. Such a refusal involves an error of law, namely a failure to exercise the jurisdiction granted by s 10, so as to deprive the applicant of the right to have the application made under the section determined. 

104This involves jurisdictional error of the kind discussed in Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission [2010] HCA 1; [2010] 239 CLR 531 at [72], namely a 'misconstruction of the relevant statute thereby misconceiving the nature of the function which the inferior court is performing'. While such errors can be difficult to discern, as discussed in Hoffenberg v The District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142 at [21], that difficulty is not present here.

105This question should be answered yes.

Question 3.3 - Did I err in law in deciding that each of the circumstances in para 2.10(3)(a) - (c) were:

""(a) for the purposes of s 10(3)(c) C(SP)A, not extenuating circumstances in which the offence by Mr Lavorato occurred; or

(b) for the purposes of s 10(3)(d) C(SP)A, matters that I might properly consider?""

106The facts stated by her Honour were:

""2.10 I then proceeded to consider the provisions of s. 10 C(SP)A and made the following findings

..

(3) none of the following were ""extenuating circumstances""

(a) Mr Lavorato's position within the Club,

(b) the short interval between the commencement of Sch 4 to the Liquor Act, and the offence of the offences charged,

(c) that the offences occurred because of a mistake rather than a deliberate attempt to flout the law,""

because the offences were

(d) offences of strict liability,

(e) for regulatory type matters unless there is a salutary type punishment there is really no deterrent effect of any penalty ""

107The proceedings below were by way of an appeal from the Local Court under s 17 and s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review ) Act 2001. They were by way of a rehearing (see Hoffenberg at [17]). Her Honour had to determine whether the applicant had satisfied the onus which fell upon him to make out a case for the exercise of the discretion to make an order dismissing the charge under s 10(1)(a), having in mind the facts found on the evidence led. That obliged her Honour to determine whether those facts established 'extenuating circumstances' of the kind which s 10(3)(c) is concerned with, so as to warrant the exercise of the discretion (see Hoffenberg at [25]).

108A refusal to entertain an application under the section, because of a view that the strict liability offences of which the applicant was found guilty, were not offences in respect of which the s 10 discretion was available to be exercised, because ""for regulatory type matters unless there is a salutary type punishment there is really no deterrent effect of any penalty"", involved an error of law. 

109The effect of an order dismissing a charge under s 10(1)(a), is that there is no penalty imposed. The charge is dismissed. To refuse to entertain an application for the exercise of that discretion, because of a view that particular strict liability regulatory offences all require the imposition of a penalty, because of the need for deterrence for such offences, involves obvious error.

110The legislature has granted those convicted of any offence the right to have an application under s 10 heard and determined on its merits, on the evidence led and the submissions advanced. Section 10(3) specifies the matters to which the Court must have regard in determining such an application. By s 10(3)(d), that includes 'any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.' Such a 'matter' cannot include a view that applications made under the section in respect of strict liability or regulatory offences ought not to be entertained at all. That is a matter for the legislature to determine. To act on such a view is to fail to exercise the jurisdiction granted by the section.

111The question must be answered yes. 

Question 3.4 - Did I err in law in deciding that

(1) the issue of whether Mr Lavorato had or had not taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could to obtain compliance by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences, 

(2) was not an issue relevant to:

(a) whether the offences might properly be dealt with under s 10(1)(a C(SP)A, or

(b) the sentencing of Mr Lavorato for the offences upon conviction for them?

Question 3.5 - Alternatively to [(4)] above, did I err in law in failing to decide the issue in [4(1)] above?

112These questions may be considered together. The Crown submitted that there was no finding in the terms posed by these questions and accordingly they did not arise.

113The facts stated by her Honour were:

""2.5 In respect of the objective seriousness of the offence, I found that 

(1) each offence was a single offence,

(2) the alcohol had been supplied in its original bottle rather than poured into a glass,

(3) there had been a general directive to staff not to do what they did,

(4) the staff who engaged the subject of the charges,

(a) for reasons relating to the hour or sheer mistake did not do so on these occasions, but

(b) usually complied with the condition.

2.6 Having regard to the above and taking into account the potential consequence of the conduct charged, I concluded the offences were towards the lower end of the scale.

2.7 I found relevant subjective considerations as follows

(1) Mr Lavorato was not at the Club on the particular night and was not required that he actually be in attendance at that time,

(2) the management structure and staff handbook were very proper and very properly managed,

(3) the Club appeared to manage its ""responsible service of alcohol"" duties well,

(4) there was some evidence in the document in Tab 13 of a du(sic) lack of some signage on the Club's premises, but there was no suggestion in that evidence of anything but an oversight or mistake. I considered this evidence to be of less importance that (sic) anything else.

2.8 I then considered the importance of deterrence for the matter before me and

(1) concluded that on the matter of general deterrence it seemed rather pointless to punish Mr Lavorato personally, but 

(2) the position was different on the issue of specific deterrence because a chief executive officer must show leadership and a change in attitude within the organisation must change from the top,

(3) a penalty imposed on its chief executive officer is something the Club would take into account in how it deals with matters of this nature.

...

2.9 I made no finding about whether Mr Lavorato had or had not taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could to obtain compliance with the condition by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences.""

114Whether or not Mr Lavorato had taken all reasonable steps in so far as a manager could, to obtain compliance by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences of which he was convicted, was a question of fact, raised to be determined on the case which the applicant advanced in support of his application under s 10. He was entitled to advance a case that the evidence established that he had taken such steps and that this was a matter which her Honour should take into account, in considering his s 10 application.

115Her Honour was obliged to determine the application on the evidence led and the submissions advanced by the parties. Section 10(3)(b) permitted the application to be advanced on the basis of 'extenuating circumstances' and s 10(3)(c) 'any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider'. A failure to consider facts relied on to establish the existence of extenuating circumstances, or other matters relevant to be considered in determining whether the discretion granted by the section should be exercised, amounted to an error of law. 

116Reference to her Honour's judgment and the evidence there referred to, is not an available means of determining whether or not the extenuating circumstances on which the applicant relied, were dealt with. The case which her Honour has stated, after hearing the parties' contest over this matter, indicate that they were not. 

117The questions posed require consideration of whether that omission involved an error of law. Given the requirements of s10(3); the failure to make factual findings in relation to the claim that the applicant had taken all reasonable steps, in so far as a manager could, to obtain compliance by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences; and the failure to consider the submissions advanced in respect of that claim, to support the application for the exercise of the discretion, involved an error of law.

118These matters were also relevant to an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the applicant's offences, in the event that the exercise of the discretion under s 10 were refused. Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act specified the aggravating and mitigating factors which are relevant and known to the Court, which must be taken into account in determining sentence. By s21A(1) the identified matters are 'in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law.'

119The mitigating matters specified in s21A(3) include for example that the offence was 'not part of a planned or organised criminal activity' (see (b)) and that 'the offender is unlikely to re-offend' (see (g)). Given the nature of the strict liability offences here in question, if the facts relied on established that Mr Lavorato's had taken all reasonable steps, in so far as a manager could, to obtain compliance by the staff whose conduct constituted the offences of which he was convicted, that was a highly relevant mitigating matter which he was entitled to raise, have determined and if established, have taken into account, in the determination of penalty. 

120It follows that a failure to consider and determine the matters relied on, to establish this mitigating factor and if established to take it into account in determining the sentences to be imposed, also involved an error of law.

121It follows that both questions posed must be answered yes. 

Question 3.6 - Did I err in law in deciding that the object of imposing strict liability for regulatory type offences would not be achieved in the absence of a conviction and the imposition of a penalty i.e. by then being dealt with under s 10(1)(a) C(SP)A?

122The Crown submitted that this question did not reflect the terms of her Honour's findings. To the contrary, she applied the provisions of s 10 and made a determination, on the evidence, of the appropriate penalty, having in mind the matters specified in s 10(3). Section 10(3)(d) permitted consideration to be given to the nature of the offence and the need for general and specific deterrence in the circumstances. The weight given to those factors was not a question of law.

123These submissions may not be accepted. The case her Honour stated leaves no room for doubt that her view was that an order under s 10 should not be made available to the applicant, given 'the object of imposing strict liability for regulatory offences' of the kind in respect of which the applicant had been convicted under s 11(2) of the Liquor Act 2007. That view involved a construction of both s 10 and s 11(2), patently inconsistent with the express terms of the two sections.

124The maximum penalties to be imposed in respect of a s 11(2) offence is specified in the section. There is no minimum penalty specified. Orders under s 10 are available to be made in respect of s 11(2) offences. A refusal of an application which rests on a view that orders under s 10 should not be made in respect of such strict liability regulatory offences, does not involve the required consideration of the nature of the particular offences in question, or a determination of the need for general and specific deterrence in the particular circumstances which have arisen for consideration. To the contrary, it reflects a view that irrespective of the nature and seriousness of the particular offences in question, given the need for deterrence in respect of offences of that kind, the discretion granted by s 10 should not be exercised. 

125That approach is inconsistent with the proper construction of s10 and s 11(2) and involves a failure to exercise the jurisdiction granted under s10, as I have earlier discussed. 

126By its terms s10 grants a person charged with an offence under s 11(2) the right to make an application for the exercise of the discretion granted in his favour and to have it heard and determined on its merits. The fact that such an offence is a strict liability regulatory offence, does not preclude an applicant from being given the benefit of the section, if a case for the exercise of the discretion is made out on the evidence and submissions advanced.

127It follows that the question should be answered yes.

Orders

128I would propose the following orders:

1. Answer question 3.1 in the stated case 'no' and the other questions stated 'yes'.

2. Set aside the orders of the District Court.

3. Remit the matter to the District Court for disposal in accordance with law.

4. The Crown to pay the applicant's costs of the stated case.

129THE COURT: In order to determine the effect of the Court's conclusions, it is convenient to summarise them in the form of a table. For this purpose, it is convenient to number the questions 1-6, although they all fell within section 3 of the stated case and were, for that reason, numbered 3.1-3.6 in two of the separate judgments set out above.

130In order to set aside the judgment in the Court below, it was necessary for the applicant to obtain an affirmative answer in respect of a particular ground.

		04 June 2013",2012-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708372,Zany WONG v R [2012] NSWCCA 39,"Judgment

1MEAGHER JA: I have considered the evidence and addressed the respects in which there was competing evidence. I agree for the reasons given by Rothman J that it was open on the whole of that evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Zany Wong (the appellant) was guilty of each of the offences charged.

2HOEBEN J: I agree with Rothman J and the order which he proposes.

3ROTHMAN J: The appellant was charged by indictment with one count of aggravated sexual assault in 2002 (Count 1), one count of indecent assault in 2002 (Count 2) and a third charge, being a count of aggravated sexual assault in 2004 (Count 3). Counts 1 and 3 are a contravention of s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 and Count 2 is a contravention of s 61L of the Crimes Act. The Indictment charged the third offence in the following terms:

""3. Between 1 January, 2004 and 27 December, 2004 at Marrickville in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [XXX] without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that [XXX] was under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years.""

4The appellant pleaded not guilty to each charge and was found guilty on Counts 1 and 2 and not guilty on Count 3. He was convicted by unanimous verdict of the jury. The appellant appeals against his convictions. The single ground of appeal relied upon is that ""the verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence"".

5The appellant's submission is, in general, based on two related issues, being: first, that guilt depended on the complainant's testimony and the appellant's denial; and, secondly, that the verdict of not guilty to Count 3 means that the jury did not accept the complainant's evidence, at least in that respect. I will deal with each of these issues as part of the more general proposition that the convictions on the two counts were unreasonable. The appellant does not submit that the verdicts are, in the strict sense, inconsistent.

The Trial

6These proceedings were a ""second trial"" in relation to the allegations - the first trial having been aborted without ever being completed. As a consequence, the complainant's evidence was given by playing an audiovisual recording of her evidence in the aborted trial. That audiovisual recording did not form part of the evidence (it was marked for identification as MFI 1 and 2). The recording was treated as if it were viva voce evidence, and was not transcribed in the ordinary way. A separate transcript was provided. The complainant was otherwise not subject to examination and cross-examination in Court: see Transcript 16 March 2010 pages 21 and 23 and Transcript, first trial, 24 and 25 February 2010 pages 1-74.

7Otherwise, the trial was short and occupied four days of evidence and addresses (including the summing up of the trial judge). No complaint is made about the summing up or any interlocutory or other judgment of the trial judge or the conduct of the trial.

8Both the complainant and the appellant are Chinese from Burma. The complainant came to Australia in 1995, when she was about six years old. The complainant was born on 28 December 1989. Her father had immigrated in 1991 and she, her mother and her brother joined her father in Australia in or about 1995. On her arrival in Australia, the complainant met the appellant and his family. The two families became friendly.

9The appellant is married and has two children. The complainant spent some time with the appellant's children and the appellant's wife liked the complainant being with her children.

10The complainant's evidence was that the appellant, his wife and two children slept in the main bedroom and, when the complainant stayed the night, the complainant slept on a mattress at the foot of the bed.

11On one occasion in 2002, when the complainant was 12 years old and in Year 7 at school, the complainant and her family went to the appellant's home. The appellant was home at the time, as was his wife and their two children.

12The complainant's family left and the complainant stayed the night. This, according to the complainant, was the only time in 2002 that the complainant slept at the appellant's house. The complainant testified that it was getting dark at the time they arrived. The complainant's father testified that it was lunchtime and that they all ate lunch together after which he and his wife left. 

13The complainant's evidence was that this occasion occurred over a weekend, when the weather was warm but cloudy and in the first part of the year, namely, between January and June. She denied, the assertion put to her, that, on this occasion, she first saw the appellant when he arrived home at 10.30pm

14The complainant then gave evidence that she was sitting on the bed in the main bedroom putting the youngest child to sleep when the appellant entered the room and sat on the bed on the complainant's right-hand side. The appellant, it was said, grabbed the complainant on the arm and pulled her back onto the bed. At the time, the complainant was wearing pyjama pants and a T-shirt.

15The appellant, on the evidence of the complainant, pulled down the complainant's pyjama pants and placed his hand inside her underpants. He said to her: ""It's going to be okay"". The appellant then placed one of his fingers in her vagina and moved it in and out. The complainant told him to stop, but he did not. Further the complainant says that she reached for his hand and tried to get it out, but the appellant told her that it would be okay. The complainant was scared and shocked.

16With his other hand, the appellant grabbed the complainant's breast, first over and then underneath the T-shirt. The appellant cupped her breast and touched her nipples. This went on for less than a minute. The appellant then stopped what he was doing and left the room. The youngest child was asleep on the bed during this event.

17The complainant went into the bathroom and cried. She pulled down her underpants and saw that they were wet but did not know why that was so. She cleaned herself up and, after a while, went back into the bedroom and saw the appellant's wife entering the room saying that she was going to go to sleep. The complainant then went to sleep.

18The complainant disagreed that the appellant slept on the couch that night. The complainant maintained there were two beds in the room, on one of which the appellant's two children slept.

19The complainant was collected by her parents the next morning. The appellant said nothing to them about the foregoing event and the complainant did not tell anyone what had happened because, according to her evidence, the complainant felt scared, ashamed and embarrassed. The complainant disagreed that the appellant had left the home early that morning.

20A week after the foregoing incident, the complainant received a phone call on her mobile phone from the appellant. According to the complainant, the appellant said to her: ""Do you like me, do you love me?... Do you think about what I did to you last time?"" The complainant replied in the negative and hung up the phone.

21A few months after the telephone call, the appellant approached the complainant while she was walking home from school with some friends. As the girls were walking through a park, the complainant saw the appellant at the driver's side of a white work van, which was parked in the car park. The appellant offered her a lift home. The complainant's friend enquired whether the complainant knew the appellant and the complainant told her that she did and not to worry.

22In cross-examination, the complainant clarified that by using the term ""a few months"" she had intended to convey a period of about three months. The complainant disagreed that the appellant did not have a white van in 2002.

23The complainant also gave evidence as to the facts alleged in Count 2. A couple of months after the incident in the park (which, if the earlier evidence were correct, would be approximately 5 months after the incident at the appellant's home), the complainant went to a restaurant for a birthday celebration with her family. The appellant and his family were also there. After they had eaten lunch, the complainant noticed that the appellant's daughter (the older child) was falling asleep. According to the complainant, she asked the appellant's wife whether she wanted her to take the daughter to the car for a nap, to which the appellant's wife agreed. Whereupon the complainant took the daughter to the car, put her in the child's seat in the back and the complainant sat in the front passenger seat.

24After the complainant had been in the car for a little while, the appellant went outside and sat in the driver's seat of the car. He then put his hand on the complainant's leg and rubbed her thigh. The complainant told him to stop and to get off her. The child woke up; the appellant alighted the vehicle, removed the child from the car seat and returned to the restaurant.

25The complainant testified that she had felt violated, embarrassed and that the appellant had taken advantage of her. In cross-examination the complainant stated that she had sat in the car for two or three minutes after the appellant had returned to the restaurant and that, when she finally left the car, she locked it and went back into the restaurant, giving the keys back to the appellant's wife who put them in her bag.

26The complainant could not remember whose birthday celebration it was. Nor could she remember in which month the celebration had occurred.

27On one particular day in 2004, when the complainant was 14 years old and in Year 9 at school, the complainant was at home, heard the intercom and answered it. The appellant asked to use the bathroom. The complainant said that the appellant informed her, through the intercom, that he had dropped off a customer, would come in and leave quickly. At the time the appellant worked as a taxi driver, according to the complainant.

28On entering the unit, according to the complainant, the appellant went to the kitchen and, after an enquiry from the complainant as to the reason the appellant was in the kitchen, the appellant grabbed the complainant, and pushed her into the laundry against the washing machine. He then pushed her to the ground, put his hands down her pants and touched her vagina. According to the complainant, the appellant was in the squatting position while he was touching her vagina; he moved his finger in and out of her vagina; unzipped his pants and pulled out his penis. The appellant then, according to the complainant, grabbed the back of the complainant's head and tried to force it down towards his penis.

29The appellant told the complainant that she would like it and that she should touch his penis with her hand. Her hand came into contact with the appellant's penis but she did not put her mouth on it. During this time, the appellant's finger was in the complainant's vagina and for some of the time the appellant was touching the complainant's breasts. The complainant stopped struggling; the appellant then got up, went back into the kitchen, stood there for a few moments and left the unit. The incident, it was said, lasted about 15 minutes. At the time, according to the complainant, she felt scared, terrified and helpless. She did not tell anyone about what happened that afternoon.

30There was another incident in 2006 when the complainant was 16, turning 17. The appellant came to the complainant's home and the appellant let him in, because she felt overwhelmed. No assault occurred, but there was, according to the complainant, a discussion about what had happened in the past. In cross-examination, counsel put to the complainant that the visit in 2006 involved a conversation that was confined to the appellant asking if the complainant's father was home because he wanted to speak to him about some money that was owed. The complainant denied that this was the content, or even part of the content, of the conversation.

31After the conversation the complainant locked the front door and called her boyfriend. About an hour later she went outside to go to the corner shop. On leaving her premises she saw a taxi and immediately ran back into the unit.

32When the complainant's father came home that afternoon, the complainant told him of the incidents or some of them. He suggested she go to the police but she was afraid to do so and felt she was not up to it.

33The complainant's father gave evidence confirming the discussion (albeit with slightly different timing) to which the complainant had attested as occurring in 2006. According to the father, this conversation occurred three years prior to the trial, namely, in about March 2007. Following that discussion the complainant's family saw less of the appellant and his family.

34In May 2009, the complainant told both her parents about what the appellant had done to her. The complainant's father eventually telephoned the appellant and confronted him about what he had done to his daughter. The complainant's father told the appellant that the complainant had to apologise to his daughter and the appellant agreed. 

35A meeting was organised at which the appellant would apologise to the complainant according to Burmese custom. The apology ceremony occurred on 24 May 2009 at the home of the appellant's brother-in-law. Approximately 20 people were present, including the appellant, his wife and parents and the complainant and her parents. After the apology ceremony, according to the complainant's father, the appellant rang him, cried over the phone and said that the appellant's father had been nice to him and had helped him ""to stay on the outside"".

36Objection was taken to the admission of the apology into evidence. The recording of the apology was not admitted, but the appellant's recollection of it to the police was part of the admissions of fact. There is no appeal against that decision. The apology was written in Burmese. The complainant understood only a few words but understood that the appellant was apologising and asking for forgiveness of the things that he had done. Both the appellant and complainant had to sign a written apology. The document was witnessed. Also tendered were photographs of the apology ceremony, during which the appellant knelt before the complainant in an act of contrition in order to seek forgiveness. After the apology ceremony, the complainant spoke to police for the first time. She made a statement on 25 June 2009.

37Other evidence was adduced as to what occurred at the apology ceremony, which confirms the description given by the complainant.

38Constable Stephens gave evidence of an interview with the appellant during which the appellant, through an interpreter and his solicitor, declined to answer questions in relation to the allegations made, but read out the apology letter that he had signed.

39The appellant gave evidence and denied that the acts, as described by the complainant, took place. In relation to Count 1, the appellant said that he worked in a factory in 2002. His routine was to wake at 6.30am, to dress, pray and go to work at his factory. On the one occasion on which the complainant slept over at his place, the appellant testified that he returned home from work around 10.30pm at which time his wife told him that the complainant was staying. He grabbed a pillow and blankets and slept on the sofa.

40The next morning he went to work, as usual, and returned at about 7.30pm, by which time the complainant had returned to her home.

41The appellant denied telephoning the complainant one week later; denied picking her up from the park; and testified that he did not own a white van in 2002. The appellant bought a white van in 2003. Receipts for the purchase of a van were tendered to confirm that testimony.

42As to the allegations giving rise to Count 2, the appellant testified that there was a celebration for the birth of his son on 2 November 2002. The complainant and her family attended that celebration. The appellant testified that he drove to the restaurant in a car; he kept the keys to the car in his pocket; and he did not any stage go to his car during the celebration to find, or be with, the complainant. Further, he did not see anyone take his daughter to the car for a nap or otherwise.

43Lastly, the appellant denied going to the complainant's address at a time when she was alone. He commenced driving taxis in 2005, which is when he obtained his taxi licence. He denied touching the complainant as she alleged; he denied exposing his penis; and he denied grabbing her head and pulling it towards his penis.

44The appellant gave evidence that in 2007 (as distinct from the time to which the complainant testified of 2006), that he went to the complainant's house when she was alone. He was wearing his taxi uniform. He went there to see the complainant's father about the money that had been borrowed and had not been repaid. (The complainant's father agreed that the appellant had lent him $10,000. On the father's testimony this was repaid in about 2004.)

45The appellant gave evidence that he attended the apology ceremony. His wife had warned him that if he did not attend and apologise then she would leave him. After the ceremony his wife told him to call the complainant's father and apologise to him again, which he did.

46Exhibit C in the proceedings is an admission of facts in which the appellant states that his understanding of the apology was that it was in or to the following effect:

""I, Zany Wong, today is the [sic] 24 May 2009, today is the date I am officially to apologise. I did like [sic] indecent physical abuse so I officially apologise. I apologise to [the complainant and her parents] for my indecent physical abuse.""


47Further, exhibit C repeats a question from a police officer during an interview to which the appellant answered ""yes"". The question, which was asked after the appellant had read aloud the apology document in the interview, was in the following terms:

""Mr Wong, do you agree that this is a letter that's signed by yourself, saying that as of today, the 24th May 2009 [sic], you plead for forgiveness for committing indecent physical abuse to [the complainant]""?


48In cross-examination, the appellant testified that the complainant's father required him to apologise to his daughter. The appellant did not ask him, on his evidence, what he, the appellant, was supposed to have done. It was submitted that the appellant did not ask this question because he already knew what had occurred. 

49The appellant maintained that, when he attended the apology ceremony, he was not aware of that for which he was apologising and on being asked to sign the document, he was amazed that the document said he had committed an indecent assault. He agreed that he signed the document; and that he bowed down before the complainant to plead forgiveness for having indecently assaulted her. 

50The appellant's explanation was that he did this, not because the allegations were true or the statements were true, but because he had been pressured to do so by his wife. He also stated that he did not read the document because he had done nothing wrong. Nevertheless, the appellant agreed that the custom was to bow down only to a person in a position of respect and the ceremony that took place was unusual. The further conversation with the complainant's father was to thank him for forgiving him and occurred only because the father had led the appellant to believe that the matter had been reported to police.

51The appellant's wife also gave evidence. As to Count 1, the appellant's wife originally stated that her younger child had not been born at the time that the complainant stayed at her place. Later she gave evidence that both children had slept on the other bed and other testimony inconsistent with her initial evidence.

52The appellant's wife confirmed that her younger child was born on 16 September 2002 and confirmed that, in that year, the appellant owned a motor vehicle and not a white van. The appellant bought a white van in 2003. Further, the appellant's wife corroborated that the appellant commenced driving taxis in 2005.

53Contrary to the appellant's evidence, his wife testified that the complainant stayed over in 2002 during the weekend and the appellant did not return from work that evening or go to work the next morning. Nevertheless, the appellant's wife testified that the appellant returned home from a delivery job at about 10.30pm and left early the next morning in order to shop.

54She denied that he went to work, which was the evidence of the appellant. The appellant's wife also testified that the appellant returned home that day at about 3pm.

55As to Count 2, the appellant's wife testified that her husband drove to the restaurant in the motor vehicle, not the van. She stated that her husband had retained the car keys and that the appellant and her mother in law helped with the children, not the complainant. The appellant's wife conceded that she had a second set of keys to the car, but they were not, on her evidence, with her at the restaurant. She also denied that the appellant left the table whilst they were at the restaurant.

56The appellant's wife confirmed that she had required her husband to apologise under threat of divorce and a prohibition on him continuing to see his children. According to her testimony, the complainant's father kept the apology letter and threatened the appellant with incarceration, as a result of which she asked her husband to apologise again in the phone call that followed. The appellant's wife agreed that the appellant used the terms ""letting him stay outside"" in thanking the complainant's father for his forgiveness.

57As earlier stated, the evidence was within short compass. Ultimately, the jury was faced with a stark choice between the version given by the complainant and the denials given by the appellant. Some of those denials depended upon independent facts, corroborated by his wife. On the complainant's evidence, the timing of Count 3 depended upon when the appellant commenced driving taxis. In the appellant's case he tendered his taxi licence which indicated that he commenced driving taxis in 2005. If that evidence were accepted, the events as described by the complainant must have occurred in or after 2005.

58Otherwise, the case depends upon which of the two, the complainant or the appellant, should be believed. In aid of that decision is the apology given by the appellant. The apology, as was made clear by the trial judge in his summing up, does not corroborate the timing or details of any of the charges, but does render the denials by the appellant less persuasive.

Principles on Appeal

59The grounds upon which an appeal may be allowed include that the conviction is ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"": s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That ground involves a question of fact and not a ""question of law alone"": M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492; Krishna v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318; Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322. Section 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides for an appeal against conviction as of right ""on any ground which involves a question of law alone"". Otherwise, leave to appeal is required.

60The appellant did not seek leave to appeal. Parties and legal practitioners are on notice, and have been for some years, that leave to appeal is necessary except where the ground of appeal on which a party relies involves a question of law alone. This matter was not the subject of argument before the Court. Given the nature of the argument and matters raised, I would be minded to grant leave.

61The High Court has on a number of occasions stated the principles that should be applied in dealing with an allegation that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence: see M v The Queen (supra); Jones v The Queen (1997) HCA 56; 191 CLR 439; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.

62The question to be answered is not the same as whether, as a matter of law, there was evidence to support the verdict. This Court on appeal must review the whole of the evidence available to the jury and determine whether it has a doubt, after the review of that evidence, that the accused was guilty, which doubt it is not resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence. The question that this Court must answer is whether the evidence satisfies the Court beyond reasonable doubt, not simply whether there is evidence of every element necessary to prove guilt.

Conclusion

63Clearly, there is evidence of every element necessary to prove guilt on each of the relevant charges. But that is not the question.

64I have read the transcript, including the extract of the transcript of the ""first trial"", being the evidence of the complainant. I have also examined the exhibits in the trial. I have not watched the recording of the complainant's evidence, because it would give preponderance to that evidence over the evidence of the appellant.

65I reiterate my comments in Brendon Singh v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 100, in which I said:

""132 A great many criminal cases depend upon which of two versions is accepted, often in circumstances where it is the word of the alleged victim against the word of the alleged perpetrator. That one witness's evidence is accepted and another witness's evidence rejected, of itself, and without independent evidence or some other factor affecting that assessment, cannot be a basis upon which a jury verdict is necessarily rendered unreasonable. The same is true of a body of evidence, from more than one witness.

...

137 The reading of a transcript is not usually as effective as hearing and seeing witnesses.

...

139 For my own part, having read the evidence, I do not have a doubt of a kind that would warrant the setting aside of the verdict. Theoretically, it is always reasonably possible that a person is lying, or, alternatively, telling the truth, but, in this case, the determination of truthfulness and reliability derives from just the kind of advantage that a jury has in seeing and hearing the evidence and to which the High Court referred in M v R , supra, at 494, recited above.""


66As earlier stated, the jury was faced with a stark choice. The terms of the apology suggest that the appellant was not being truthful in his denial of the events in question. The appellant's wife, while supporting the appellant's version of events in a number of respects, also corroborates a number of aspects of the complainant's evidence.

67The one issue upon which there is clear independent evidence is the date upon which the appellant was licensed to commence driving taxis. That date was in 2005 and after the time said by the complainant to be when incident the subject of Count 3 occurred. In his summing-up, the primary judge said: 

""What is said in each of the counts on the Indictment is that between two dates, 1 January, 2002 and 27 December, 2002 for both Count 1 and Count 2 and between 1 January, 2004 and 27 December, 2004 for Count 3 that between those times the Crown says the events the complainant gave evidence about occurred. Now that date range is an ingredient of the offence. So that if you cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence occurred between those dates, then you must find the accused not guilty. It is not a question of saying well the Crown has not proved that it happened between those dates, but we are pretty sure it happened outside those dates, the Crown has to prove that they occurred between those specific dates and if they cannot prove that, you must find the accused not guilty.""

68It seems clear that the jury has believed the complainant on all issues except the timing associated with Count 3. In that respect the verdict is consistent with the jury accepting her evidence that the appellant was wearing a taxi uniform but rejecting her evidence as to the year in which it occurred. As a consequence, the jury has returned a verdict of guilty on the first two counts and not guilty on the third.

69There is nothing inconsistent in those verdicts. Moreover, having examined the evidence at length, I would take the same view. I have no doubt of the requisite kind that would warrant this Court interfering with the jury's verdict. I propose that the Court make the following orders:

(1) Leave to appeal granted;

(2) Appeal dismissed.

		05 April 2012",2012-04-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708379,R v White & ors (No 3) [2012] NSWSC 467,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 21 March 2012 I announced my decision that certain evidence sought to be adduced on behalf of the accused Todd Serone was not admissible as tendency or coincidence evidence (T243.15). These are my reasons.

2This trial formally commenced with the empanelment of the jury on Tuesday 13 March 2012. The accused Rodney White is charged with the murder of Saaid (Sid) Zaiter at Chinderah on 16 December 2008. The accused Serone and the accused Birkensleigh are charged with being accessories after the fact to that murder. Birkensleigh is also charged with the robbery of the deceased (she is alleged to have been an accessory before the robbery).

3When the matter was mentioned before me on Monday 12 March 2012, Mr Bodor QC, who appears for the accused White, made an application for a trial separate to the accused Serone. The bases of the application are fully set out in my judgment refusing that application: R v White & ors (No 1) [2012] NSWSC 465. One basis of the application was that there would be prejudice to White through the manner in which it was understood Serone was going to conduct his defence. Mr Walmsley SC, who appears for Serone, had informed Mr Bodor, and confirmed to me, that his instructions were that Serone was acting under duress when he performed the acts that the Crown alleges give rise to his accessorial liability. It was said, in short, that Serone will claim that he had been threatened by White. In relation to that basis of the application, I was of the view that it was premature to take it into account because it would only become evidence before the jury if Serone entered the witness box. There was no guarantee that it would.

4I will not set out the factual complexity of the Crown case in this judgment. Reference may be made to the overview that I set out from the Crown Case Statement in the separate trial judgment. Suffice to say for present purposes, it is the Crown case that after the accused White killed Mr Zaiter in a cabin in a caravan park at Chinderah, near Tweed Heads, he enlisted the accused Serone to obtain a tow truck in order to tow the deceased's car to a remote bushland location near Kyogle where it was set alight and destroyed. He then had the accused Serone, with the assistance of others, hire a car, go to the cabin, retrieve the body of the deceased and transport it back to another similarly remote bushland location. There the body was transferred to another vehicle. Serone departed at that point and White, and others, proceeded to take the body elsewhere and dump it in a location where it was thought that it would never be found. I understand the Crown to be relying on the acts undertaken to dispose of the body as establishing the liability of the accused Serone as an accessory after the fact. It would seem that the Crown accepts that when he was involved in retrieving the vehicle and assisting in it being towed to the Kyogle area he was not aware, or the Crown cannot prove, that he had any knowledge that a murder had been committed.

5One of the principal witnesses for the Crown, Mr Stephen Orams, commenced giving evidence on Monday 19 March 2012. Mr Orams was an acquaintance of the accused White. He had observed White's behaviour in a variety of situations on a number of occasions in the 6 years or so that he had known him prior to the alleged murder. He set out an account of his observations in some of his statements to police, principally in the first statement that he made on 29 December 2008. The Crown led very little from Mr Orams as to these matters in his evidence in chief. They were not relevant.

6Mr Bodor was the first to cross-examine Mr Orams. Towards the end of his cross-examination he asked that a matter be raised in the absence of the jury (he had foreshadowed doing so earlier in the day). Mr Bodor indicated that he understood that Mr Walmsley proposed to cross-examine Mr Orams as to those matters that appear in his statements that concern the prior behaviour of the accused White. Generally speaking, Mr Bodor was concerned that such evidence would be prejudicial to his client.

7Mr Walmsley confirmed that he intended cross-examining Mr Orams, and others, as Mr Bodor had suggested. The matters were said to be relevant to the claim by the accused Serone that White had threatened him, which he claims were relevant to the issue of duress. It seems to be common ground that Messrs Orams and Serone did not know each other and that, therefore, the experiences and observations of Mr Orams were not within the knowledge of Serone. By way of example, he took me to paragraph 44 of Mr Orams statement of 29 December 2008 and submitted in respect of it:

""[I]t is an example of what might be seen to be a tendency of Mr White to conduct himself in a certain way in circumstances where I, on behalf of Mr Serone, will be seeking to argue that that's precisely the sort of thing that was in my mind as a consequence of similar threats."" (T209.27)

8It quickly became clear that Mr Walmsley was intending to adduce tendency evidence and that he had not provided any notice of such an intention to any of the other parties: s 97(1)(a) Evidence Act 1995. The matter was adjourned until Tuesday 20 March 2012 in order for necessary steps to be taken. It was not a case of considering whether the notice requirements should be dispensed with (s 100) because no application to do so was made and, more particularly, because it was important that the terms of the proposed evidence should be identified with some particularity in order to permit the other parties to consider it.

9I observe that it is regrettable, at least, that the statutory requirement to give notice had been completely overlooked until drawn to counsel's attention during the course of the trial and then only because of the concern expressed by the representatives for another accused. The requirement to give notice is not a meaningless matter of routine. It serves a very useful purpose in enabling the orderly consideration by other parties and, if necessary, the court, in dealing with questions of admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence. It is also regrettable that I was given to understand before the trial commenced that there were no issues that could be dealt with prior to the jury being empanelled. If proper notice had been given, this would have been an appropriate matter to be dealt with prior to empanelment, or at some point during the trial chosen to avoid or minimise inconvenience to the jury.

10A notice was prepared and served in the late afternoon of Monday 19 March and I heard submissions in relation to the issue on Tuesday 20 March. Coincidentally and fortunately, a juror rang in ill that morning. The jury were notified that they would not be required until the following day and so were not inconvenienced while time was taken to deal with the issue.

The notice

11The notice was of an intention to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence (""the notice""). It was said that the person whose tendency, and/or coincidental conduct, the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced was the accused White. The notice continues:

The tendency sought to be proved is his tendency, and/or coincidental conduct, to act in a particular way, in particular circumstances. Namely, when enlisting the support of friends and/or colleagues to assist him as an accessory after the fact to murder, such assistance is sought to be secured by him by threatening that person with physical violence, including death or the infliction of very serious injury, unless that person does what is required of him/her in those requests.

12The substance of the evidence was identified by reference to a list of paragraphs and sentences in a number of prosecution witness statements. Also in this list was a brief summary of the evidence it is anticipated the accused Serone will give:

That Rodney Boyd White threatened Todd Serone with death or serious injury if he failed to follow White's directions in performing the activities relied upon by the prosecution as amounting to accessorial conduct after the fact to the murder of Sid Zaiter.

13That is a reference to the fact in issue to which the proposed evidence relates rather than being evidence to establish the tendency/coincidence.

14The final paragraph of the notice provides that, ""in the view of the lawyer with the current conduct of the matter"", the tendency and/or coincidence evidence bears upon the facts in issue in this trial, including the following facts in issue:


Whether Todd Serone was threatened with death or really serious injury by Rodney Boyd White at relevant times.


Whether Todd Serone voluntarily performed the conduct alleged to constitute his acting as an accessory after the fact to the murder of Sid Zaiter.

The evidence

Stephen Orams statement 29 December 2008

15This is the first of four statements made by Mr Orams. Paragraphs 3 to 21 set out the history of his relationship with the accused White. Paragraphs 22 to 35 set out an account of the events concerning White on 14 to 16 December 2008. Paragraphs 36 to 43 set out an account of events that occurred between 17 and 26 December 2008. Paragraphs 44 to 45 refer to a telephone call Mr Orams received from White on 29 December 2008. It was that telephone call that led to Mr Orams' decision to talk to the police and which, in turn, led to the making of this statement. The balance of the statement sets out some miscellaneous matters concerning White.

16On behalf of the accused Serone, it is proposed to cross-examine into evidence the following (I will summarise and partly quote with reference to the paragraph number; I have omitted reference to matters that are in the notice but which were not pressed in submissions):

8 Mr Orams had seen (on some unspecified occasion(s)) the accused White ""flip out and yell at April (his former girlfriend) and threaten to hit her"".

9 On an estimated five times in the past two years, Mr Orams had seen White ""in a rage or a strange mood. There were times when he might have been angry with April or other members of his family. He would be off his head on drugs and he would tell me not to let him flip out and to keep him calm."" 

10 Mr Orams had a rule that White was not to use drugs at the Orams home but there had been two or three times when he was ""going to flip out unless I let him use drugs"". ""He would say that he was going to kill us if I didn't let him take his drugs and that he hadn't slept for days"".

12 White had a pistol which he produced from a bum bag. He always carried it. (I note that this is already in evidence. It was cross-examined in by Mr Bodor (T175-176; 184).)

15 White had told Mr Orams that ""he had beat up people in the past and people were scared of him because he used to run the coast. I just thought he was big noting himself"".

17 Mr Orams hired a storage shed for White in about 2006. It was in Mr Orams' name and Mr Orams paid the storage fees, but only when White gave him the money to do so. Mr Orams spoke to White about putting the lease into his own name. ""Every time I tried to bring this up, Rod would threaten to bash me and my family"".

24 White called Mr Orams on 15 December 2008 and said that he was not far away and that he and his current girlfriend, the accused Birkensleigh, wanted to stay the night. ""By this stage I was never happy with him being around but I was scared enough and intimidated enough to do what he said"".

17Paragraph 44, along with a corresponding paragraph in the statement of Mr Orams' wife, Sarah, (see below), was characterised by Mr Walmsley as being as the ""centrally focussed areas"" that he wished to elicit from each of those witnesses (T224.11). It is appropriate to quote it in full:

About 11.30am, Monday 29th December 2008, I received a call on Sarah's mobile phone. The call came from the mobile number that Jess [Birkensleigh] gave me [number omitted]. It was Rod on the phone. He was pretending [to] be someone else but I knew his voice.

He said, ""What have you done with my belongings?""

I said, ""Tiffany your sister ...""

He interrupted me and said, ""You don't know who you're talking to. I'm just a mate of his.""

I said, ""Tiffany and the police have got all your stuff.""

He said, ""Why? They were safe with you.""

I said, ""The police are involved and I had no choice in it.""'

He said, ""Well expect a visit from some of my mates from Melbourne.""

I took this to mean that he was going to come and bash me or kill me. I was terrified. He knows my name, he knows my family's names, and I know that he is capable of doing this.

18Mr Walmsley conceded during the course of submissions that the last paragraph within paragraph 44 is not admissible (T223.35).

Stephen Orams' statements 31 December 2008 and 15 January 2009

19The notice also refers to Mr Orams' second statement of 31 December 2008, although no submissions were made about it. The passage identified in the notice is paragraph 11. The context is that Mr Orams was explaining how he and his family stayed at caravan parks at Ballina and Casino between about 18 and 27 December. Paragraph 11 includes that he booked under an assumed name in both places because he ""was afraid that Rod would make enquiries with caravan parks in the area looking for me and my family"".

20Another item referred to in the notice but not referred to in submissions was a portion of Mr Orams' third statement of 15 January 2009. Paragraph 6 includes, ""You can never predict when Rob [a reference to White] is going to blow up about something. It could start as simple as him wanting a drink, and me not getting it for him immediately"". 

21Paragraph 13 of the third statement appears in the context of Mr Orams recounting events in the days following 16 December 2008. White had left but Ms Birkensleigh was still with the Orams. The portion of paragraph 13 identified in the notice is:

""Previously Rob has told me that the people he deals with, if they turn on you, will also turn on your family. I was worried that having Jess there would make us a target. Even if we got Jess out of there, they may still have seen him come to our house. I was also concerned about who the people in the hire car with Rob were. I[n] paragraph 35 of my first statement, I mentioned that Rob told me that April had a contract on him. After seeing Rob's behaviour, I thought that this was the truth and she knows where I live"".

22Mr Orams readily acknowledged that he was not entirely truthful with the police until he made his fourth statement of 5 March 2009. He agreed with Mr Bodor that a person could be untruthful by withholding matters, telling lies, or changing words so as to deflect from the truth. He agreed that ""in varying forms"" this is what he had done in his first three statements (T179.6). This raises a question as to whether, if the above matters are the subject of cross-examination by Mr Walmsley, Mr Orams would maintain that they were truthful. It was agreed, however, that I should proceed to determine the question of admissibility on the basis that the evidence would be to the same effect as it appears in the statements. If I determined that the evidence is, at face value, admissible, or any of it is, it would then be necessary to consider hearing the evidence on the voir dire before making a final determination.

Sarah Orams' statement

23Ms Sarah Orams made a statement on 15 January 2009. The notice identifies paragraph 20 as being admissible as tendency and/or coincidence evidence. It should be read in conjunction with paragraph 44 of Mr Orams' first statement set out above. It is appropriate to quote it in full:

""I have recently received a few TXT's from Jess Phone number [number quoted] which include, ""Hey guys this is not my phone anymore you know who this fucken is.people are coming up to visit you, were is all my fucken belongings.ring me now copper"" received at 11:25:08 on 29/12/2008, then another one saying ""Where are my fucken belongings I want them.australia is a small place.family you fucked that off it seems like"" received at 11:29:55 on 29/12/2008. After receiving these TXT's Steve tried to ring Rob back on the number but the phone was off. After that I received a call from Jess' phone and Rob said, ""Put me onto Bro"" I said, ""Is that you Bro"" he said, ""No it's another Bro"" and I gave the phone to Steve. That is the only conversation I had with Rob on the phone from the time that he left our place on the Tuesday."" (Grammar, spelling and punctuation as in original.)

Text messages sent by White

24The final matter that appears in the notice was an attachment to a statement by Detective Virginia Gorman of 7 March 2009. The notice identifies Attachment K, but it is in fact Attachment F and comprises a schedule of text messages sent to and from White's phone that are said to disclose ""drug dealings in context with threats of violence"". Many of the text messages are capable of being regarded as attempts by White to set up some sort of drug transaction with the deceased. The one upon which particular emphasis was placed was sent at some unspecified time on a date between 30 November and 4 December 2008 inclusive:

""Call me chines do you want to see my m8 from melb you no I need to see ya china.""

25It would appear that ""Chines"" was a term White used when referring to the deceased. 

Submissions in support of admissibility

26Mr Walmsley submitted that the accused Serone's involvement in the events of 16 December 2008 commenced with him being requested to perform a relatively innocuous task of towing a vehicle for White. He had been asked to perform similar tasks in the past. It was shortly after the deceased's vehicle was set alight that, at some point down the road away from that scene, Serone and White had a conversation. It was in the presence of the prosecution witness Elefsen and the co-accused who has earlier pleaded guilty, Humphries, but not in their hearing. 

27In this conversation, according to the proposed evidence of Serone, White referred to Elefsen and Humphries, who Serone had not previously met. He told Serone that they were hit men from Melbourne; they did not know the area; Serone had to take them to get a hire car; and he was threatened that he would die if he did not. White will also be said to have stated, ""I know where your brother and father are"" (T219.5).

28It was anticipated that this evidence would provide the explanation for Serone's involvement in going to the cabin at Chinderah, assisting in the removal of the body of the deceased and taking it away to a place where White and others took it further into bushland where it was dumped (T219.11).

29Mr Walmsley informed me that his client's case will be that he was a friend of White's and did a lot of work on cars for him. White was a very dogmatic character who prevailed upon people in his daily life to do things for him. Examples of that type of behaviour are already in evidence from Mr Orams. Serone and Mr Orams had separate, but similar, relationships of this nature with White.

30Serone's involvement in responding to the request to tow the deceased's vehicle was typical of the relationship. But then he was prevailed upon under threat of death to do more.

31Mr Orams did not refuse to assist White, even after he was drawn further into events by being required to act as a lookout at the caravan park at the time of the murder. Mr Orams had knowledge of White's violent and erratic behaviour and was not going to say ""No"" to him. It was submitted that this provided a parallel with what occurred in relation to Serone when he was threatened (T221.46). 

32Mr Walmsley did acknowledge, however, that there was a different dimension to what occurred in relation to Serone; he was threatened with death or serious injury whereas Mr Orams, although panicked and frightened, was not. Mr Orams was not threatened to continue with participation. He just did what he was asked to do (T221.49).

33It was submitted that ""the parallel becomes more complete"" when regard is had to paragraph 44 of Mr Orams' first statement. Mr Orams received a call on his wife's mobile from White on the morning of 29 December. A threat was made by White, ""well, expect a visit from some of my mates from Melbourne"". It was submitted that a reference to ""mates from Melbourne"" or similar was a consistent theme in threats made by White (T222.23). The same reference was made in what Serone will say was the threat made by White to him by the roadside after the disposal of the deceased's car and before Serone involved himself in the accessorial acts. 

34Mr Walmsley characterised the ""fact in issue"" as ""whether or not [the jury] are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown have negatived the proposition that White threatened Serone"" (T222.40). I interpolate that this is not something the Crown is necessarily required to do. It is only one part of the duress issue.

35The probative value of the evidence was said to lie in the correspondence between the threat made to Mr Orams and the threat made to Serone. Serone will say that he was threatened and Mr Orams will also say that he was threatened and was petrified and ""did certain things"". Both were threatened, despite the fact that they were friends or colleagues. Serone was threatened with death or serious injury (T222.44 - 223.3).

36So, it was submitted, that if a thing occurred on one occasion, it assisted in determining whether it occurred on a second occasion; hence the probative value of the tendency and/or coincidence evidence (T223.5).

37In relation to the paragraph in Ms Orams' statement, the submission was that this tied in with, and corroborated, paragraph 44 of her husband's first statement and they were, as I indicated earlier, submitted to be the ""centrally focussed areas"" that Mr Walmsley wished to elicit from each of those witnesses (T224.11).

38As to the schedule of text messages, the reference to ""my m8 from melb"" was submitted to be a recurrence of a theme of White referring to mates from Melbourne. Other entries in the schedule were said to be related to drug transactions but Mr Walmsley focussed on ""the threat"", ""because of its close parallel with each of Orams and that which my client will say was the threat offered to him as being quite significantly ... [of] potential or rational probative value"" (T226.5).

39Aside from paragraph 44 of Mr Orams' first statement, Mr Walmsley characterised the other portions identified in the notice (and still pressed) as being ""more general (T227.41).

40In relation to Mr Orams' evidence about White possessing a handgun, Mr Walmsley accepted that there was no suggestion of him having used it except on the occasion when he fired it at a time when the car he was in came across the tow truck driven by Mr Waters with Serone as passenger. It would seem this was done in order to attract the attention of Messrs Waters and Serone and have them pull over. Mr Walmsley conceded, however, that White's possession of a gun ""might not be of great contention; it might be in a different category to which I'm raising"" (T228.44).

41In relation to the passage in paragraph 15 of Mr Orams' first statement that was pressed, (""he told me he had beat up people in the past"" etc), it was submitted to be significant that White said such intimidating things to friends and colleagues and raised ""the spectre of danger to anyone if he gets crossed, things don't work according to his directions"". It was conceded, however, that this was a ""minor aspect"".

42There was an implicit concession that the passage in paragraph 24 of Mr Orams first statement was of little significance: ""This is in the general category and might not fit within the confines of this tendency notice"" (T229.22).

43Those were said to be the matters that Mr Walmsley relied upon; which I take to mean that in addition to those matters which were explicitly not pressed, those that were not mentioned were no longer relied upon either (T229.41). It was reiterated that ""the sharp focus"" was upon paragraph 44 of Mr Orams' first statement and paragraph 20 of Ms Orams' statement (T229.42).

44The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence relied upon by Mr Walmsley ""shows a general disposition towards erratic and unpleasant behaviour that falls short of establishing a tendency to behave in a particular way such that the conduct has significant probative value on the issue as to whether or not it is a reasonable possibility that Mr Serone was acting under duress"" (T234.1).

45Although Mr Walmsley did not, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the portions of Mr Orams statements of 31 December 2008 and 15 January 2009 that were included in the list of evidence in the notice. It was his submission that they fell into a category of evidence concerning Mr Orams' state of mind. Similar evidence in the statement of 29 December 2008 was not pressed, it being conceded that it was not admissible. The same view should be taken of the passages in the later statements (T234.10).

46The Crown Prosecutor submitted that paragraph 8 in the first statement simply shows a disposition towards violence in the context of a domestic relationship; no relevant tendency could be inferred from it (T234.20).

47Paragraph 10 (9 and 10 in fact) indicate threats made by White in the context of a significant state of drug intoxication; no relevant tendency could be inferred from that (T234.25).

48Paragraph 12 was not addressed and that is probably because the evidence is already before the jury.

49The admission by Mr White to Mr Orams set out in paragraph 15 of prior violence by him and that people were scared of him could not be led as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted. It could only be relevant to Mr Orams subjective state of mind; a matter conceded to be inadmissible (T235.3).

50Paragraph 17 was accepted to contain a clear threat by White to bash Mr Orams and his family. This was capable of being construed as a threat to inflict really serious injury which is the type of harm it is suggested that Serone will claim (at least) that he was threatened with on 16 December 2008. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that establishing ""strict similarity"" or even a close resemblance between the evidence in question and the facts in issue was not required under s 97. However, he submitted that this evidence was too dissimilar for any meaningful conclusion as to the asserted tendency to be inferred (T235.20).

51The Crown Prosecutor suggested that perhaps Mr Walmsley had pitched the requirement that the significant probative value of the evidence be relevant to the probability of Serone's account being true on the question of duress. Given the Crown bears the onus of disproving duress beyond reasonable doubt, it was submitted that it was only necessary for Mr Walmsley to establish a significant probative value of the reasonable possibility that the account was true.

52Finally, it was submitted for the Crown that ""it's a big leap to transpose the behaviour in one relationship based on very isolated instances into there being conduct of the same kind in a different relationship with a different person in a different context"" (T236.36).

53Doubt was raised as to the standing of Mr Bodor to object to the evidence sought to be adduced on behalf of a co-accused. In any event, he supported the submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor (T237.22).

54In submissions in reply, Mr Walmsley confirmed that he was not suggesting that the relevant tendency could be inferred from the individual items of evidence but that it could be inferred from their cumulative effect (T240.19).

Resolution

55I do not intend to set out in detail what has been said in the many authorities on the subject of tendency and coincidence evidence but record that I have had regard to R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308 at [33]-[35]; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; (2011) 278 ALR 765 at [147]-[149]; and the collective references to authorities contained in R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; (2010) 205 A Crim R 75 at [56]-[70] and DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 at [2]-[9]; [40]-[75].

56First, it is necessary that the evidence is relevant. This is a question as to what the evidence is capable of establishing; whether it does so is a matter for the jury. It is necessary that the evidence has significant probative value, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the accused Serone. This is a question as to the degree to which the evidence could affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. Is it to a degree that is more than merely relevant but something less than to a substantial degree? Is its probative value ""important"" or ""of consequence""? R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459. These concepts are the subject of much discussion in the authorities, some of which I have referred to above.

57It is unnecessary for there to be a striking pattern or similarity between the incident in question (threats made by White to Serone) and the incidents the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced; the evidence need only be of a tendency to act in a particular way: R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; (2009) 273 ALR 286 at [38] per Campbell JA.

58It is must be borne in mind that because it is an accused who wishes to adduce the evidence, the fact in issue in respect of which the evidence must have significant probative value is one for which he only has an evidentiary onus. In other words, it is for the accused Serone to show that there is a reasonable possibility that his actions were committed under duress. It then becomes a matter for the Crown to eliminate that issue beyond reasonable doubt.

59Although the notice referred to the evidence being tendency and coincidence evidence, no real attempt was made to characterise it as the latter. I cannot see that it could be and so I have put that contention to one side.

60The notice asserts that the tendency of the accused White that is sought to be proved is that, when enlisting the support of friends and/or colleagues to assist him as an accessory after the fact to murder, such assistance is sought to be secured by threats of physical violence. That is not really the effect of the tendency sought to be established. There is no suggestion that White sought assistance of others as accessories after the fact to murder on any other occasion. The tendency that I understand is sought to be established is to secure the compliance of friends and/or colleagues in doing White's bidding by threats of physical violence. Mr Walmsley accepted that as a better formulation of the tendency he sought to establish (T243.11).

61Before turning to the evidence relied upon, it is worth noting that Mr Walmsley did not press some portions of the evidence listed in the notice. They generally fell into the category of the subjective reactions of persons to things said and done by White. The last three sentences of paragraph 44 of Mr Orams' first statement is an example.

62The evidence that White threatened to hit his girlfriend, and that he became angry and in a rage when he was either on drugs, or hanging out for drugs, are not suggested to have any connection with White securing the compliance of anyone in doing his bidding. It simply shows, at its highest, a propensity to be angry and intimidating.

63The evidence that he threatened to kill Mr Orams' family if he was not permitted to use drugs in their house is capable of being regarded as threatening violence for the purpose of obtaining something that he wanted, but it was not for the purpose of getting someone to do something for him. It was for the purpose of them allowing him to do something himself, or for the purpose of him getting his way. That might be a fine distinction when it is accepted that there is no requirement for a striking similarity or the like.

64Mr White's possession of a handgun does not support the proposition that he had the tendency in question. There is no suggestion that it was used to threaten anyone to secure their compliance with his demands. The only evidence of use of the gun is that he fired it in order to attract the attention of those in the tow truck, but that is all. 

65The evidence that White told Mr Orams of having ""beat up people in the past"" and that ""people were scared of him"" would be relevant if Mr Orams' subjective state of mind was an issue. It is not. Evidence that White made such statements is not admissible to establish that he had in fact been violent in the past. Moreover, there are no details about the circumstances; it would be speculation to assume it was something to do with White threatening people with violence in order to have them do his bidding.

66There is the evidence of White threatening to bash Mr Orams and his family whenever Mr Orams brought up the subject of putting the lease on the storage shed in White's own name. The evidence is very imprecise and the situation is very much removed from the situation in question.

67In relation to the passage in paragraph 24 of Mr Orams first statement that he was ""scared enough and intimidated enough to do what [White] said"", Mr Walmsley made the concession: ""This is in the general category and might not fit within the confines of this tendency notice"" (T229.22). The concession was appropriate. It is evidence of Mr Orams' subjective state of mind and does not assist in establishing an inference that White had the tendency asserted.

68The major matter upon which reliance was replaced was the evidence in paragraph 20 of Ms Orams' statement and paragraph 44 of Mr Orams' first statement. It is capable of being regarded as White threatening violent retribution in response to Mr Orams having allowed the police to take possession of some of his belongings. In my view, it is so different from the situation that the accused Serone claims occurred that it cannot possibly be the basis for an inference that White had a tendency to act in the manner asserted.

69No submissions were made about the passages in Mr Orams' second and third statement referred to in the notice. They comprise a statement as to Mr Orams' subjective state of mind (2nd statement at [11]); an assertion that White was unpredictable and volatile (3rd statement at [6]); and a suggestion that White's associates were violent. None of these matters are capable of supporting the inference for which the accused Serone contends.

70Finally, the text message schedule annexed to the statement of Detective Gorman contains one message that was said to involve a threat of violence. I have set out its terms earlier. To divine a threat of violence from it, in my view, would be to engage in speculation or wishful thinking. In context, it seems far more likely to be a reference to a person who was claimed by White to be intended to be involved in a proposed drug transaction.

71I have had regard to each item referred to in the notice for which reliance was not withdrawn in the course of submissions. I have had regard to them both individually and in their collective force. On a generous view, the evidence could be said to be relevant. But it is, in many respects, imprecise, general, and/or completely unrelated to the situation the accused Serone claims to have experienced. Indeed, there is very little that concerns White making threats of violence when enlisting the support of friends and/or colleagues to do his bidding. 

72I was unable to conclude that the evidence has significant probative value in relation to the fact in issue, whether it is a reasonable possibility that White threatened Serone with death or really serious bodily injury if he did not assist in the manner alleged by the Crown.

73For these reasons I ruled that the evidence was inadmissible.

2708380,R v Sachinkumar Ramanbhai PATEL [2012] NSWDC 177,"SENTENCE


1I am sentencing Sachinkumar Ramanbhai Patel for becoming involved in a crime to do with the proceeds of crime. What Mr Patel did in late 2010 was to open a series of bank accounts with different banks and at different suburbs in his own name. There was transferred into those bank accounts, from someone else, significant sums of money. Then, over a period of a few days later in the same month, Mr Patel withdrew cash amounting to just over $42,000. Mr Patel has admitted that in withdrawing that cash he was dealing with the money. He has also admitted that he was reckless to the risk that that cash represented the proceeds of crime. 

2This activity meant that he was guilty of a crime against the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He pleaded guilty to an offence under s 400.6(2) of that legislation. It carries a maximum of 5 years imprisonment.

3It was agreed between the prosecution and the defence that the money which had been transferred into these various accounts opened by Mr Patel was effectively stolen from the accounts of innocent people. Someone had set up a scheme of wrongfully obtaining money from other people's accounts and depositing the money into the accounts opened by Mr Patel. 

4Mr Patel was not the person who organised the scheme but, as Mr S A Fraser of counsel who appeared for him acknowledged, he facilitated the process of the principal offender getting access to the funds. The benefits which Mr Patel got were fairly limited and included a return trip to India. India is where Mr Patel came from on a student visa in 2008. He was studying in Australia and working in cafes or restaurants and earning a limited amount of money. 

5The Federal Police arrested Mr Patel on 13 April 2011 and he has been in custody since then. His sentence will date from then. After some negotiations with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions he pleaded guilty to the crime that I have referred to.

6There is a limited amount of information about Mr Patel. A pre-sentence report contains the following summary -

""Mr Patel presents a confusing overall picture. His motivation for his commission of the offence remains obscure other than possible financial. It was difficult to confirm details of his circumstances both in India and Australia. He has no prior criminal history in Australia and has been described as cooperative during his time in custody on remand where he has not come under any adverse notice. He would presently appear to be leading an isolated existence in custody, where he receives very few personal visits.""

7Mr R Ferral-Smith, who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, helpfully provided me with some written submissions which highlighted the factors which I need to take into account in sentencing Mr Patel.

8Obviously I have to take into account general deterrence - the kind of conduct which Mr Patel engaged in enables other people to launder the proceeds of their more serious criminal activity. As Mr Ferral-Smith said in his submissions (which I mark for identification 1) the commission of frauds and other crimes for profit would be pointless if the perpetrator could not safely gain access to the funds. Deterring persons from engaging in money laundering helps to prevent and deter other criminal conduct.

9The amount involved, namely just over $42,000, is significant. As his Honour Judge Zahra SC said in Regina v Farah (NSWDC, 9 September 2011, unreported) in his remarks on sentence (at page 8) - 

""The amount of money involved is highly significant as it provides the means of dividing the offences into categories. It is the primary identifier of the maximum penalty.""

His Honour was referring to s 400 of the Criminal Code. That creates various offences to do with money laundering. I can see from the legislation and I am told that offences will differ by reference to whether the amount involved is $100,000 or more, $50,000 or more, or $10,000 or more.

10Obviously I am sentencing Mr Patel for the crime involving $10,000 or more but it is significant that the amount of money dealt with by Mr Patel falls not far short of becoming a more serious crime. Dealing with property of $50,000 or more carries a maximum of 7 years imprisonment as distinct from the maximum of 5 years which Mr Patel is facing. As Mr Ferral-Smith argued, the amount handled by Mr Patel ""is four times the amount required"" for the offence.

11Mr Patel pleaded guilty on 24 January 2012. That demonstrates some evidence of contrition and remorse and is generally a mitigating factor. I take it into account on the basis that it shows that Mr Patel was willing to facilitate the course of justice. In due course I will make an allowance of a discount for the penalty that I might have otherwise imposed because of his plea of guilty.

12On the other hand, as Mr Ferral-Smith argued, the case against Mr Patel was strong and the offence was serious. I should add that I do regard Mr Patel's crime as a serious example of this offence, primarily because of the amount involved and the fact that he withdrew the cash over some nine transactions although only over a few days. Mr Ferral-Smith argues that a period of full time imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case and I agree with him. 

13Mr Fraser acknowledges the significant gravity of his client's offence. Mr Fraser helpfully took me through several matters which Judge Zahra had referred to as being relevant to sentencing for these sorts of crimes. The source of the money was from innocent account holders and Mr Patel facilitated the process of obtaining the funds for somebody else. The period of time was relatively short and we do not have information about the intended use of the money. The crime obviously involved a good deal of planning by Mr Patel but, as Mr Fraser pointed out, it did not extend to the sophistication of inventing false holders of the accounts - the relevant accounts were opened in Mr Patel's own name.

14Mr Fraser emphasised that in pleading guilty his client had facilitated the course of justice and reminded me that crimes of this kind may consume a good deal of resources in being prosecuted. He reminded me of his client's remorse and contrition and the fact that he had no previous convictions. He, being from India, has no local family in Australia, so that his time in custody has been harder. He is a first time offender. It is difficult for me to agree that he is unlikely to re-offend or that his prospects are good. I do not make any unfavourable findings on those topics but there is very little known about his client. 

15I would regard initially an overall sentence of 40 months as being appropriate but I propose to discount that to 30 months namely 2½ years because of the plea of guilty and also taking into account other factors. I would regard a non-parole period of half that period of time, namely 15 months, as appropriate to fix in this case.

HIS HONOUR: I will just depart from my remarks on sentence. I will return to my remarks on sentence.

16My attention has been drawn to s 19AC of the Crimes Act 1914 by Mr Fraser. He asks me not to set a non-parole period but to make a recognizance release order in respect of his client, and I propose to take that course.

17Accordingly, the sentence which I impose upon Mr Patel is one of 2½ years to commence on 13 April 2011 and to expire on 12 October 2013. Under s 19AC of the Crimes Act 1914 I make a recognizance release order in respect of that sentence of 15 months commencing 13 April 2011 and the order may become operative on 12 July 2012.

HIS HONOUR: Now there are other provisions. What is the-

FERRAL-SMITH: Section 20(1)(b) of that Act - sorry can I start again, 19AC applies. The Court must make a recognizance release order in respect of that sentence. Recognisance release order is defined in s 16 as an order made under paragraph 20(1)(b). I'll hand that back to your Honour now.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Let's have a look. What is the security that I should specify, what do you ask for Mr Ferral-Smith?

FERRAL-SMITH: Not less than $1000.

HIS HONOUR: I think I will now rephrase the sentence.

18Under s 20(1)(b) I convict Mr Patel of the offence which I have described and I sentence him to imprisonment for 2 ½ years from 13 April 2011 to 12 October 2013. But I direct by this order that Mr Patel be released upon giving security in the sum of $1000 after he has served a period of 15 months of imprisonment in respect of that offence. I note that that period of 15 months will expire on 12 July 2012.

FERRAL-SMITH: I wonder if your Honour is prepared to release him upon the recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of time, for 2 years I would ask. 

FRASER: I don't wish to be heard.

19The release is subject to the condition that Mr Patel is of good behaviour for the period of 2 years after release. 

HIS HONOUR: Anything else? 

FERRAL-SMITH: Not from me. 

20All right, Mr Patel, you have got 2½ years imprisonment for that crime. It started when you were arrested on 13 April last year 2011 so it finishes on 12 October 2013. I have directed that you may be released after 15 months, that is half of that. And that would be due on 12 July 2012 in about 3 months time. Once you are released you have got to stay out of trouble, be good for 2 years. If you are not of good behaviour or commit further offences you come back before me and you may go back to gaol. In addition you may be required to pay $1000, because you have breached the promise to be of good behaviour. Do you understand that? 

OFFENDER: Yes.

2708394,DPP v Starr [2012] NSWSC 315,"Judgment
Introduction
1The plaintiff appeals, pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, against the dismissal by Atkinson LCM (the Court below) of an information pursuant to which the first defendant was charged with one count of possessing a prohibited weapon, namely, a knuckleduster, in contravention of s 7 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (WP Act).  The plaintiff seeks orders that the dismissal be set aside and the proceedings be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.
2The plaintiff submitted that the information was dismissed because of an erroneous interpretation of the definition of ""knuckleduster"" which resulted in the Court below misdirecting itself of the matters of which it needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and that this involves a question of law alone.
3The defendant filed a submitting appearance in this Court.
Relevant statutory provisions
4Section 7 of the WP Act provides:
""7 Offence of unauthorised possession or use of prohibited weapon
(1) A person must not possess or use a prohibited weapon unless the person is authorised to do so by a permit.
Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years.
(2) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a person who is the holder of a permit to possess or use a prohibited weapon is guilty of an offence under this section if the person:
(a)  possesses or uses the prohibited weapon for any purpose otherwise than in connection with the purpose established by the person as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the weapon, or
(b)  contravenes any condition of the permit.""
5A ""prohibited weapon"" is defined in s 4(1) as ""anything described in Schedule 1"".  Schedule 1 to the WP Act, headed ""prohibited weapons"", contains a list of items that are prohibited weapons for the purposes of the Act.
6Clause 2(19) of Schedule 1 provides:
""Knuckle-dusters or any other similar article that is made of any hard substance and that can be fitted over 2 or more knuckles of the hand of the user to protect the knuckles and increase the effect of a punch or other blow or that is adapted for use as such.""
The hearing in the Court below
The relevant evidence and submissions
7The prosecution case was that on 14 October 2010 the defendant went to Sydney Airport. His luggage was screened by security in Terminal 3 and as a result of seeing something irregular his bag was searched. A Protective Services Officer located a belt with a buckle in the shape of a knuckle-duster. Sydney Airport Uniform Police officers (of the Australian Federal Police) were called to the screening point. They placed the defendant under arrest and cautioned him.
8The prosecution called Senior Constable Ken Condie, who was attached to the forensics ballistics investigation section of NSW Police, to give evidence. A challenge was made to his expertise but the Court below  ruled that the witness was qualified as an expert to give evidence of his opinion.  The following exchange took place in the course of the cross-examination:
""Q: So in determining that it was protective of the knuckles, how did you make that conclusion?A: I've got numerous photographs of the exhibit as received in the packing, by itself and over my fist. I always ensure that I can put it over my hand. I don't know how big the whoever was in possession of this. I can't say their hands are. But I know it fits over mine.
Q: So you don't know whether it would fit over the hand of the accused as the user of it?A: No, I have to look at it as it is, the physical item I have, I examine that and make sure that its capable of fitting over at least my hand, and I make sure it fulfils everything in the Act.
Q: It might very well fit the hand of a person with slim fingers or a child or some other person. But in order to determine whether or not it would satisfy the requirements being the user, being the person in possession of it, you would need to know, would you not, whether or not it could fit over his hand?A: Well, that's not part of my duties. That's not my role, It's a knuckleduster designed to fit over -
Q: The hand of the user.A: - whoever the user is, whoever intends to use it.
Q: That's a question that you would need to know the answer to, isn't it, in order to determine whether it would fit over the hand of the user?A: It would depend who intends to use it.""
9The prosecution also called Senior Constable Fatih Oncu, the Sydney Airport Uniform Police officer who was approached by Protective Service Officer Cole and informed that a knuckleduster had been located in the defendant's bag.  Senior Constable Oncu deposed that he had put the belt buckle through his fingers. It fit his four fingers and ""was positioned comfortably once I clenched my hands forming a fist"". This is where he ""formed the opinion the item can be used as a knuckleduster"".  In cross-examination Senior Constable Oncu was shown a photograph of the item, which was tendered. He demonstrated how he had positioned the item over his fingers.  The transcript recorded what was said as this occurred:
""Q: The item is now in a position midway between your second and your third knuckles.A: That's correct. Well, yes, all the way down to the end, to the edge of, down to where my fingers -
Q: Hold it up for her Honour to see. Just turn your hand around so I can see, please.  Thank you.  At no stage did the accused in your presence place that item over his hand.A: No.""
10The prosecution also called Constable Kylie Pellizzaro and Constable Scott Cole in its case.  After the prosecution had closed its case the defendant conceded that there was a prima facie case. The defendant was not called to give evidence.
11In the Court below the defendant relevantly submitted that the Magistrate could not be satisfied that the knuckle-duster would fit over the defendant's knuckles or that he ever had any intention of using it for that purpose.  In those circumstances, the defendant submitted that the Court below could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant had both the requisite mens rea and the actus reus to possess a prohibited weapon.
12The Prosecutor submitted that it was relevant that the item was attached to a belt, that the definition specified protection of the knuckles not covering of the knuckles and if the item was between the middle knuckles and the top part of the knuckles this would protect the upper knuckles in relation to a punch. 13The defendant submitted in reply that a device could not be ""fitted over two or more knuckles to protect the knuckles"" unless it fitted ""over the knuckles covering the knuckles when the blow or punch is delivered"".
14The Court below found the offence not proven and dismissed the charge on the basis that she had a reasonable doubt as to whether the item fell within the definition of ""a knuckleduster"". 
The reasons of the Court below
15The Court below identified the principal issue as being whether the item ""can be said to protect the knuckles and increase the effect of a blow or punch"". 
16The Court below concluded:
""I find, having examined the item and listened to the evidence, that it is highly likely that this item would protect the knuckles in the sense that the device is raised above the knuckles. But there is no evidence before me that the item would indeed fit the hand of the user, and in this particular case we are looking at possessing the item by a particular person. 
In conclusion, having considered all of the material before me, whilst I consider that it is highly likely that the item does fall within the definition of a knuckleduster, there is a small doubt in my mind. The doubt is reasonable and therefore I am finding the offence not proven.""
[Emphasis added.]
The grounds of appeal
17The plaintiff relies on the following two grounds of appeal which are in substance one ground:
(1)Her Honour misdirected herself as to the interpretation of the description of ""knuckle-dusters"" in cl 2(19) of Sch 1 to the WP Act, erroneously holding that the term ""user"" therein means the person in whose possession the item is found.
(2)Her Honour erred in dismissing the matter.
18The plaintiff contended that the Court below was in error in requiring proof that the item fitted the hand of a defendant charged with possession, as distinct from use, of a knuckle-duster.  The plaintiff contended that this was a question of law alone because it concerned the correct interpretation of a statute, as distinct from its application.
19I accept the plaintiff's submission that this amounts to a question of law alone since it raises solely a question of statutory construction.
Construction of s 7 of the WP Act
Principles: a construction that promotes the purpose of the Act is to be preferred
20I am required to prefer a construction which promotes the purpose or object of the WP Act to one that would not advance its purpose or object: Interpretation Act 1987, s 33.
The objects and purpose of the WP Act
21The object and purpose of the WP Act can be discerned from its long title, the Second Reading Speech, any express objects provisions and a reading of the Act as a whole.
22The long title of the Act is ""An Act to prohibit and control the possession and use of certain weapons ...""
23Section 3 of the WP Act relevantly provides:
""Principles and objects of Act
(1) The underlying principles of this Act are: 
(a) to confirm that the possession and use of prohibited weapons is a privilege that is conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety, and
(b) to improve public safety by imposing strict controls on the possession and use of prohibited weapons.
(2) The specific objects of this Act are as follows: ...
(b) to provide strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to the possession and use of prohibited weapons ...""
24In the Second Reading Speech, the Attorney General told Parliament that the new statute would:
""improve public safety by imposing stricter controls on the possession and use of prohibited weapons"" (Legislative Council, Hansard, 11 November 1998, p. 9620).
25The capacity of knuckle-dusters to inflict harm on a victim and protect the hand of the perpetrator was explained by Jenkins J in Mullaney v Taylor [2006] WASC 149 in the following terms, at [29]:
""Commonsense tells me that a blow with a solid, hard object, such as this item, held in the hand by a handle would have a greater force of impact than a blow with a clenched fist alone.""
26The plaintiff relied on this material to submit that the mischief which s 7 and Sch 1 sought to remedy was to prevent any and all unauthorised use or possession of a wide variety of prohibited weapons, including knuckle-dusters, in view of the underlying need to protect public safety. I accept this submission.
Legislative history
27The predecessor to the WP Act was the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989. Section 5 of the former Act relevantly provided:
""(1) A person shall not -
(a) possess a prohibited weapon; or 
(b) use a prohibited weapon, 
unless authorised to do so by the permit or the regulations...""
28""Prohibited weapon"" was defined in s 3 as ""anything described in Schedule 1"".
29Until the Prohibited Weapons Further Amendment Regulation 1997 came into force in 1997, knuckle-dusters were defined in cl 28 of Sch 1 as:
""[a]ny article or device of a type commonly known as a knuckle-duster or metal knuckles or any article or device made or adapted for use as such.""
30As a result of the Prohibited Weapons Further Amendment Regulation 1997, the definition of knuckle-dusters in Sch 1 was amended to read:
""[a]ny article or device of a type commonly known as a knuckle-duster or metal knuckles or any article or device that is made of any hard substance and which can be fitted over the knuckles of the hand of the user to protect the knuckles and increase the effect of a punch or other blow, or that is adapted for use as such.""
31The Explanatory Note to the 1997 Regulation identified one of the objects as being to:
""...more accurately describe a number of weapons that are already listed as prohibited weapons in the Act.""
32There is otherwise no explanation of the inclusion of the term ""the hand of the user"" which was first introduced into the definition by that amendment, and nothing to indicate a legislative intention to limit the scope of persons who were prohibited from possessing such items to those whose knuckles could be shown to fit into the apertures of such items.
33When the WP Act was enacted in 1998, Sch 2(19) included a definition of knuckle-dusters that was substantially equivalent to that found in its statutory predecessor and provided as follows:
""Knuckle-dusters or any other similar article that is made of any hard substance and that can be fitted over the knuckles of the hand of the user to protect the knuckles and increase the effect of a punch or other blow or that is adapted for use as such.""
34The reference to ""two or more"" in the present definition was inserted by the Weapons and Firearms Legislation Amendment Act 2010.
Legislative context
35The relevant statutory context includes the definition of ""possession"" in s 4:
""possession of a prohibited weapon includes any case in which a person knowingly: 
(a) has custody of the weapon, or
(b) has the weapon in the custody of another person, or
(c) has the weapon in or on any premises, place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, whether or not belonging to or occupied by the person.""
36Section 4(2), which also forms part of the statutory context, provides that:
""For the purposes of this Act: 
(a) anything that would be a prohibited weapon if it did not have something missing from it, or a defect or obstruction in it, is taken to be a prohibited weapon, and
(b) a person in or on (or in or on any part of) any premises, vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which there is a prohibited weapon is to be regarded as having possession of the weapon unless the person proves otherwise, and
(c) if parts of a prohibited weapon are in the possession of, or are being carried by, 2 or more persons, each of those persons is to be regarded as possessing the weapon.""
The construction of statutory definitions
37The plaintiff also relies on the circumstance that cl 2(19) of Sch 1 to the WP Act is part of the definition of ""prohibited weapon"" in s 4.  The function of definitions in legislative instruments was considered by McHugh J in a dissenting judgment in Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; 218 CLR 216 in the following passage at 253:
""... the function of a definition is not to enact substantive law.  It is to provide aid in construing the statute.  Nothing is more likely to defeat the intention of the legislature than to give a definition a narrow, literal meaning and then use that meaning to negate the evident policy or purpose of a substantive enactment.  There is, of course, always a question whether the definition is expressly or impliedly excluded.  But once it is clear that the definition applies, the better - I think the only proper - course is to read the words of the definition into the substantive enactment and then construe the substantive enactment - in its extended or confined sense - in its context and bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was intended to overcome.  To construe the definition before its text has been inserted into the fabric of the substantive enactment invites error as to the meaning of the substantive enactment.""
38In Commissioner of Police v Kennedy [2007] NSWCA 328, Basten JA (Hislop J agreeing) referred to McHugh J's approach in Kelly and said further, at [44]:
""No doubt, as suggested by Pearce and Geddes [Statutory Interpretation in Australia], it is an excellent test of good drafting to read a definition into an operative provision to see if it fits comfortably in the text ... However, if the definition as enacted does not fit comfortably into the text, the exercise of construction will need to address any logical or grammatical infelicities that arise.""
39The definition of knuckle-duster in the Schedule is imported into the offences of possession and of use in s 7. However, its wording fits more easily into the offence of use than it does into the offence of possession because of the reference to ""user"" in the definition. When the definition of knuckle-dusters is incorporated into s 7(1), it reads as follows:
""A person must not possess or use a knuckle-duster or any other similar article that is made of any hard substance and that can be fitted over 2 or more knuckles of the hand of the user to protect the knuckles and increase the effect of a punch or other blow or that is adapted for use as such unless the person is authorised to do so by a permit.""
40The definition must relate to both the ""use"" and ""possession"" limbs of the operative provision, s 7(1). However, when a person is charged with possessing a prohibited weapon, the prosecution need not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the person ""used"" the item in question.  Mere possession is sufficient. The mens rea for the offence of possession of a prohibited weapon does not require any intention to use the weapon at all. Accordingly, there would appear to be no contextual reason why the defendant and ""user"" must be the same person when the defendant is charged with possession rather than use.
41However that is precisely what the Court below decided in the instant case. The plaintiff submitted that the result of giving the definition a narrow reading was what McHugh J cautioned against in Kelly: negation of the evident purpose of the prohibition on possession of knuckle-dusters.
42In its reasons for decision, the Court below said: 
""...we are looking at possessing the item by a particular person.""
43The plaintiff submitted that this extract provides some indication that the Court below relied on the use of the word ""the"" before the word ""user"" to support its preferred construction. The plaintiff submitted that the construction adopted by the Court below is premised on the assumption that ""the user"" must refer to a specific user in a possession case.
Legislative context: the meaning to be given to ""the"" in the phrase ""the user""
44The plaintiff submitted there are powerful textual reasons for rejecting the construction preferred by the Court below.  The plaintiff submitted that the word ""the"" can serve a number of different functions, depending on its context: Timbar Pty Ltd v ME Petrie Pty Ltd (in liq) (1982) 7 ACLR 111.
45In Timbar, Mahoney JA explained various functions of ""the"" in particular contexts including, relevantly, at 114:
""...'the' may have the function of denoting a thing or place which has previously been identified: thus in Pascoe v Nicholson [1981] 1 WLR 1061 Lord Roskill saw 'the police station', according to its ordinary meaning as being capable of denoting one particular police station rather than another, but thought that the context indicated a contrary meaning. And 'the' also has the function, and perhaps this is its primary function, of the definite article. When so used, its purpose is no more than that of the definite, as contrasted with the indefinite, article... When 'the' has the function merely of the definite article, what it does is simply to indicate a particular thing or class of thing...""
46The plaintiff submitted that the definite article ""the"" in cl 2(19) of Sch 1 to the WP Act, indicates a particular thing or class of thing: the user of the item. This construction is consistent with Mahoney JA's discussion in Timbar of the ""primary function"" of the word ""the"", being its use as the definite article and his Honour's view that ""'the' as the definite article, may be used to indicate a particular thing or class of thing"". It is also consistent with s 8(b) of the Interpretation Act 1987, which provides that, subject to any contrary intention, ""a reference to a word or expression in the singular form includes a reference to the word or expression in the plural form"".  The effect of s 8(b) in the instant case is that the singular expression ""the user"" includes a class or category of ""users"".
47Thus, where the definition of knuckle-dusters is applied to a case where a person is charged with use of a prohibited weapon, the words ""the user"" refer back to the specific user of the weapon.  However, where the definition is applied in a possession case, the word ""the user"" must, as a matter of construction, refer to a notional user or members of a class of notional users rather than to a specific user, there being no actual user who is the subject of the operative provision in s 7. The word ""the"" cannot operate as a cohesive device to ensure continuity of reference to a known ""user"" in the possession context, given that neither use nor an intent to use is an element of the offence of possession.
48In the alternative, the plaintiff submitted that the words ""the user"" in cl 2(19) should be read as ""a user"" when the definition is being applied in relation to a possession charge. This construction is consistent with ""the"" being employed to mark the singular noun ""user"" as being used generically in this context, so is consistent with one of the ordinary senses of ""the"" set out above. In Federal Firefighters' Union v Minister of State for the Capital Territory (1982) 62 FLR 341; 44 ALR 311, Fitzgerald J said, at 326:
""it is well established that 'the' may be read as 'a' when required, particularly where a provision is not skilfully drafted.""
49The WP Act does not reflect a consistent drafting choice between the definite and indefinite article, depending on whether or not one specific user is pointed to.  The only references to the word ""user"" in the whole Act are found in Sch 1, where cl 1(5) (description of ""trench knife""), cl 2(7) (""Saunders 'Falcon' Hunting Sling""), cl 2(8) (""blow-gun"" or ""blow-pipe"") and cl 2(19) (""knuckle-dusters"") each refer to a part of the body (or, in the case of cl 2(8), the breath) of ""the user"".
The consequences if the construction preferred by the Court below were correct
50The plaintiff submitted, and I accept, that the construction by the Court below would have various anomalous consequences. For example:
(1)A person with large fingers could possess any number of articles that would otherwise satisfy all the elements of the definition of knuckle-dusters if in the possession of a person with smaller hands, with impunity, simply because the person with large fingers could not fit any of the articles over two or more knuckles of his or her hand.
(2)If five people lived in the same house in which a stash of knuckle-dusters was secreted, thereby attracting the deeming provision in s 4(2)(b) of the WP Act, the criminality of its occupants would depend in part on the size of their hands.
(3)A large-fingered person could not be convicted of:
(a)buying knuckle-dusters (an offence under s 23 of the WP Act), if the item did not fit over two or more of the person's knuckles;
(b)sending knuckle-dusters to another person (an offence under s 24(1)) if the item did not fit over the sender's (or, possibly, the receiver's) knuckles;
(c)manufacturing knuckle-dusters (an offence under s 25A of the WP Act) if it did not fit over his or her knuckles.
51In each of these instances, the size of the person's fingers would mean that the article in question would not satisfy the definition of knuckle-dusters and would accordingly not be a prohibited weapon. The construction found by the Court below would have the effect of substantially narrowing the ambit of the definition of knuckle-dusters. In circumstances where Parliament has seen fit to criminalise the possession of prohibited weapons in the absence of a permit, consistent with the statutory ""underlying principle"" of ensuring and improving public safety and the purpose of strictly controlling possession of such weapons (s 3 of the WP Act), it makes little sense to prohibit a person with small fingers from possessing any article made of a hard substance that could be fitted over two or more of the person's knuckles and increase the effect of a punch or other blow, while at the same time permitting a person with larger fingers to possess the same article merely because the second person could not fit their fingers into it.
52Such an article has the same potential to increase injury to members of the public if worn when delivering a blow. The construction preferred by the Court below would not promote the purpose of strictly controlling possession and use of prohibited weapons, whereas the construction for which the plaintiff contended does promote such a purpose.
The relevance of the circumstance that s 7 is a penal provision
53The circumstance that the WP Act contains penal provisions does not attract different rules of construction. The present approach to the interpretation of penal statutes treats the rule that they should be strictly construed as one of last resort to be applied only where any ambiguity in a penal provision cannot be resolved by the application of ordinary aids to statutory interpretation: see Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (7th ed., 2011) at [9.9]; and Waugh v Kippen [1986] HCA 12; 160 CLR 156 at 164.  That the provision to be construed is a penal provision is merely part of the context which is relevant to the task of construction: Alcan (NT) v Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at 49.
54I accept the plaintiff's submissions that the ambiguity arising as to the construction of ""the user"" in cl 2(19) of Sch 1 can be resolved by application of the ordinary principles of statutory construction, having regard to both contextual and textual considerations as well as the purposive approach required by the Interpretation Act 1987.  I agree that it is not necessary to have regard to the strict construction rule as a matter of last resort.
Conclusion
55It follows from the reasons given above, that the Court below misconstrued s 7 of the WP Act. It is not necessary, on a charge of possession, for the prosecution to prove that the knuckle-duster said to be in the possession of the defendant could actually fit on the defendant's hand. The defendant and the ""user"" referred to in the definition of knuckle-duster need not be the same person when the relevant charge is possession.
56For the reasons set out above, I make the following orders:
57Appeal allowed.
(1)Set aside the order of Atkinson LCM made on 5 July 2011 dismissing the proceedings against the Defendant for the offence of ""possess prohibited weapon"" in breach of s 7 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.
(2)An order that the matter be remitted to the Downing Centre Local Court to be determined according to law.
(3)Make no order as to costs.

		11 April 2012",2012-04-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2708397,TWL v R [2012] NSWCCA 57,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: After a trial in the District Court before Coolahan DCJ and a jury, the jury found the appellant guilty of a charge, to which he had pleaded not guilty, that he ""did unlawfully kill Jamie Purdon"" on or about 20 February 2009 at Maitland in New South Wales. The appellant was 15 years and 5 months old at the time of the offence leading to this manslaughter conviction.

2On 20 April 2011 Coolahan DCJ sentenced the appellant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing 20 April 2011 to expire on 19 October 2013 and an additional term of 2 years 6 months to expire on 19 April 2016. His Honour ordered that the appellant serve his sentence as a juvenile pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

3The charge against the appellant related to the death of Mr Jamie Purdon, a young man of about 20 years of age. Mr Purdon hit his head on a hard surface after being felled by a punch to the head delivered by one AC who was then 17 years of age. The incident occurred on a Friday evening when those involved were attending the Maitland Show. Put shortly, the Crown case against the appellant was that he, AC and one AB were parties to a joint criminal enterprise to physically assault Mr Purdon, pursuant to which AC delivered the fatal blow. The Crown's case at the trial was heavily dependent on the evidence that the Crown called from AC. 

4At the hearing of the appellant's appeal against his conviction this Court concluded that deficiencies in connection with the trial had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In consequence the Court quashed the appellant's conviction. It otherwise reserved its decision. The following are my reasons for supporting the order quashing the conviction and concluding that the Court should order a retrial of the appellant. 

5The deficiencies to which I have referred were two. First, (Ground of Appeal 2), the trial judge did not direct the jury that to convict the appellant it was necessary that it be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the joint criminal enterprise for which the Crown contended involved an agreement or understanding that an act would be committed that was not only unlawful but was dangerous in the sense that it carried ""an appreciable risk of serious injury"" to Mr Purdon (Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313 at 333). Complaint about the absence of such a direction was not made at the trial but, for reasons that I give later, leave to raise the point on appeal should be granted pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

6The second deficiency (Grounds of Appeal 7(b) - 9) was that the Crown, as it accepted, inadvertently breached the pre-trial disclosure requirements of ss 137 and 138 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Crown failed to provide the appellant or his representatives with copies of reports attributing to AC descriptions of the relevant incident that arguably conflicted to some extent with the evidence that AC gave at the trial. Possession of the reports would have been of considerable assistance to counsel for the appellant in cross-examining AC, upon whose credit the Crown's case largely depended. 

7I shall now summarise the evidence at the trial but only insofar as it bears upon the issues that this Court needs to determine.

THE CROWN CASE

The evidence of AC

8On 22 February 2009 AC was charged with manslaughter in relation to Mr Purdon's death. At the first available opportunity he gave police an induced statement. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 2 years 6 months, with an 18 month non-parole period. The sentence was ordered to be served by way of periodic detention. The sentencing judge allowed a 50 per cent discount for AC's early guilty plea and his past and future assistance to police, including an agreement by AC to give evidence against the appellant. On 8 September 2010 this Court allowed a Crown appeal against AC's sentence, reducing the discount to 40 per cent, comprising 25 per cent for AC's early guilty plea and 15 per cent for assistance.

9At the appellant's trial AC gave evidence that he had known the appellant for a couple of years and that he encountered him at the Maitland Show on the evening of 20 February 2009. The appellant was with his brother and about four other people. AC said that at one point in the evening the appellant approached him in a small group that included AB and that the following exchange then occurred:

""Q. What did [the appellant] say?
A. He said something about these 20 year old dudes trying to fight [LM] who's 15 at the time and he said basically he was going back to get them.

Q. I know it's a hard thing to do, but when he said he was going back to get them can you say it as if it was him saying it now in the words he used as best you can remember?
A. This won't be exact words obviously because it was a while ago but he said, '[AC], these 20 year old dudes just tried to fight me, I'm going back to get them, have you got my back'.

Q. Have you got my?
A. 'Back'.

Q. Did you know what he meant by 'Have you got my back'?
A. As in will you watch my back? If I do something are you going to be there for me?

Q. Did you respond to that?
A. Yeah, I said okay.

Q. What was his manner when he asked you that? So how did he seem in his appearance and manner?
A. He seemed pretty worked up.

Q. Are you able to tell us what about him it was that made you think he was worked up?
A. How he was speaking. If he said he was going to go back to them he was obviously pretty worked up.

Q. After he had asked you that and you had agreed did you stay together or did you split up?
A. Yeah, we stayed together. I walked in the same group that he was in.

...

Q. Were you or anybody in your group doing anything that would indicate something was going to happen?
A. Not really. We were just walking towards the front gate but obviously someone in the group must have said something's going to happen and then it's just a small place where heaps of people are. Word must have spread and everyone gathered that there was going to be a fight so everyone thought they'd come and watch.

Q. Just tell us what happened after you had started walking around with the accused towards the front gate?
A. As we were walking towards the front gate we sort of pulled over onto the side of the road and I seen the big group behind us and I said there's a fight down at the front gate, yelled it out so everyone would go away because I didn't want a big group following us.

Q. Did any of that big group move off?
A. Yeah, there was quite a few of them walked to the front gate.

Q. Did any remain?
A. Yeah, there would have been a few hanging around still.

...

Q. So after some of this bigger group had moved away, what did you do?
A. We sat on the side of the road and then [the appellant] grabbed me and said, 'That's him. Let's go, bro,' and point to a dude with - I can't remember exactly but it was a light T-shirt. 

...

Q. Once [the appellant] had said that to you, what did you do?
A. I proceeded across the road.

Q. Where was the fellow who had been pointed out to you?
A. He was basically directly on the other side of the road.

...

Q. So you went in that fellow's direction?
A. Yes.

Q. What sort of pace were you moving at?
A. I was at a quick walk.

Q What about the accused? Was he doing anything when you moved off towards the fellow?
A. I'm not sure. I led so I didn't - couldn't see behind me.

Q. Did you look behind you at all?
A. No.

Q. You've said you moved in the fellow's direction. Did you do anything prior to going up to the fellow?
A. No.

Q. So what did you do, just tell us what you actually did?
A. I just went straight towards him [that is, Mr Purdon] and he was facing the opposite direction and I put me left arm on his shoulder and turned him around and I thought he was going to hit me and I seen his mates behind him so I reacted and punched him in the left jaw.

...

Q. When you hit the fellow to the jaw, what happened?
A. He fell backwards and hit his head"" (Transcript 31 August 2010, pp 80 - 84).

10AC said that he did not know Mr Purdon and had not seen him before the incident in question. Prior to approaching Mr Purdon, AC had asked another young man to hold his phone and wallet. AC denied in cross-examination that he did this because he knew that he was about to assault someone and did not want to leave evidence behind (Transcript 31 August 2010, p 96). He also denied in cross-examination that it was AB, and not the appellant, who told him about the 20 year old people and asked for his assistance.

The evidence of AB

11AB was 15 years old at the time of the incident that led to Mr Purdon's death. He was subsequently charged with affray and gave the police an induced statement. However he agreed in cross-examination at the appellant's trial that he had lied in that statement and also in an earlier statement that he gave to police. Following a plea of guilty he was sentenced to six months probation. 

12He said in evidence at the trial that he had known the appellant since 2008 and that he was with the appellant and other young people at the Maitland Show for most of the evening of 20 February 2009. He had not met AC before that night.

13AB said that during the evening he, the appellant and others watched a fight occur. He gave the following evidence as to what then occurred:

""Q. Did you get involved in anything that occurred immediately after the fight?
A. Yes, we did.

Q. What was that, what happened?
A. Well Jamie Purdon came up to us and asked what happened. He was kind of agro and yeah.

Q. You have referred to Jamie Purdon. Was he someone that you knew on this night?
A. No.

Q. Had you met him before?
A. No.

Q. So you have subsequently come to know that the name of that fellow was Jamie Purdon. Is that right?
A. Yes.

Q You said he came up to you and asked you what happened?
A. Yeah.

Q. Who was he asking?
A. Me at first and then [the appellant] - no sorry, it was [the appellant] first because [the appellant] wouldn't answer and then me.

Q. Can you remember what Mr Purdon said to [the appellant]?
A. No, not really.

Q. Can you remember what he said to you?
A. Just asking me what's going on.

Q. Did anybody answer Mr Purdon?
A. No.

Q. What was the next thing that happened after he asked you and [the appellant] and no one gave him that information?
A. He got a bit angry and tried to get it out of us.

Q. When you say he got a bit agro what was he doing?
A. Like he's getting tensed up and, yeah, just getting angry.

Q. How was it that he tried to get it out of you?
A. He come up and tried to face me, got in my face and [the appellant] and two of his mates broke it up.

Q. What do you mean when you say got in my face?
A. Like got like right in front of me.

Q. You have got your hand in front of your face at a distance of 15 centimetres?
A. Yeah, yeah.

Q. You said [the appellant] and two of his mates broke it up?
A. Yes"" (Transcript 31 August 2010, pp 128 - 129).

14AB gave the following evidence of a conversation that he heard occur a little later between the appellant and AC:

""Q. Did [the appellant] say anything about what he wanted to happen in the future, after the incident at the barn?
A. After [Jamie] Purdon got hit?

Q. No. After [the appellant] told [AC] about what had happened at the barn?
A. He just basically said he wants him gone.

Q. He wants him gone--
A. Wants him taken care of.

Q. I know this is hard but as best you can, can you try and put it as if it were [the appellant] saying it now, and the words he used?
A. He basically just said, you know, he told him what happened and then, 'I want him gone, I want him taken care of'.

Q. How did he seem when he was saying that, in terms of his mood, his appearance. [The appellant]?
A. Tense.

Q. What was it about him that made you think he was tense?
A. Like an adrenaline type of look.

Q. Did [AC] give [the appellant] any response to what [the appellant] had said about wanting him gone, wanting him taken care of?
A. I don't know.""

...

Q. Once Mr Purdon came into view, did anyone say anything about him?
A. We - well, I described him, and then [the appellant] pointed over, 'that's him over there'.

...

Q. Once that had been said, what happened?
A. Me, [the appellant] and [AC] walked in a fast pace. It was [AC] first, then it went - it was me, [AC], two of his friends, and [the appellant]. It went [AC], his two mates, [the appellant] and me.

Q. Where did you go?
A. Towards Jamie Purdon.

Q. What sort of pace were you moving at?
A. A fast walk.

...

Q. Did you or anyone in your group, get to Mr Purdon's location?
A. Only [AC] got that close. Me and [the appellant] about 10 to 15 metres away. 

Q. What did you see [AC] do when he got close?
A. He tapped him on the shoulder, a little bit of an argument, and then just one big hit.

Q. When Mr Purdon was hit, I think he fell down straight away?
A. Yes"" (Transcript 31 August 2010, pp 132 - 134).

Pre-incident evidence

15Ms JG, a friend of the appellant, gave evidence that the appellant had said to her in the week leading up to the Maitland Show of 20 February 2009 that he only went to the Show so that he could get into fights (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 188).

16Ms AS, another friend of the appellant, gave evidence that in the week prior to the Maitland Show the appellant had said that he was going to the Show and that ""Friday was fight night"", although he had not said that that was why he wanted to go (Transcript 2 September 2010, p 245 - 6).

17Mr RD, another friend of the appellant, gave evidence that on the night of the Show, prior to Mr Purdon's death, he had heard the appellant and others say ""Let's go after people and start fights"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 206.8). In cross-examination RD said that he did not specifically recall the appellant, as opposed to someone else in the group saying ""Let's go after people and start fights"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 210). However in re-examination he agreed that in his statement to police he had attributed to the appellant the words ""We'll just run into fellows to pick a fight with them"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 214.13 and following).

Post-incident evidence

18Ms JC gave evidence that the appellant had run up to her on the night of the Show and asked her if she had seen what had happened (referring to the assault on Mr Purdon). When she said no, he told her that ""a group of people had approached him and asked for his phone, and he said no, then he said he was going to get his boys to see how tough they were ... [and] a guy called, [AC], had punched someone out"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 190.38 and following). When telling her that ""[AC] had punched someone out"", the appellant had punched his fist into his hand and appeared excited. 

19Ms KC gave evidence that on the evening of 20 February 2009 the appellant had told her about someone having been ""knocked out cold"", had said that he did not do it and that AC was responsible (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 176). She said that later the appellant had called her on her mobile and said ""If the cops ask you mine or [AC's] name, don't give it to them"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 173.48). Later again that night KC received a text message from the appellant which included the statement: ""I'm fucking scared because everyone thinks it was me and not to mention the cops just drove past. You know it wasn't me right"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 174). 

20Mr JF gave evidence that on the evening, sometime after the incident in question, the appellant had told him the following:

""When I left the showground these four 20 year olds came up and said 'Give me your phone and wallet.' 'Nah, I'm not giving you my phone and wallet. I'll fight to the death.' I said, 'Wait here 10 minutes'. One of them said to me 'Oh, who ya gonna get?' I said, 'You'll see'. I walked back with heaps of people and the four 20 year olds saw me and they started to run away. Some of the boys in my group ran after them. [AC] caught up with one of them and hit him in the side of the head and the bloke hit the ground. Now the coppers are chasing me"" (Witness Statement of JF dated 21 February 2009, p 2).

THE DEFENCE CASE

21The appellant gave evidence that he was present when AB was involved in two altercations prior to the incident that led to Mr Purdon's death. He said that during the second altercation Mr Purdon approached the participants and tried to break them up, leading to a verbal exchange between AB and Mr Purdon.

22The appellant gave evidence that, later, AB asked AC for help, apparently, to confront Mr Purdon. AC asked the appellant if AB was the appellant's friend. He responded that he was. 

23The appellant said that as his group approached ""three guys"" (who must have included Mr Purdon) the following events occurred:

""When - when they had found out [AC] said, 'Well, let's go and get him,' I had actually grabbed [AC] on the arm and said [AC], don't worry about it, it's not your fight. [AC] shrugged me off. Him, two of his mates and [AB] ran at the - at the three other guys. And that's all I saw until I got down there. I was about 20 metres away from the footpath of where Mr Purdon was struck and I could see him laying on the ground with - with a lot of blood around his head and not moving at all"" (Transcript 2 September 2010, p 275).

THE SUMMING-UP

24The trial judge summarised the Crown's case as follows:

""What the Crown says in this case is that the accused was involved in what lawyers call a joint criminal enterprise to visit physical violence upon Mr Purdon and the participants in that joint criminal enterprise were [AC] and [AB]. Although the Crown would succeed if it satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the, if there was an agreement to do, it was between the accused and [AC] only. But the Crown says that [AB] was also part of that agreement. 

...

The Crown says that you would infer from [the evidence of AC and AB] and draw the conclusion that from both the words and the actions of the accused, [AB] and [AC] that there was an understanding or arrangement that Mr Purdon would be physically assaulted and that you would be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt"" (Transcript 10 September 2010, pp 6 - 8).

25I turn then to consider the appellant's grounds of appeal.

GROUND 1 - ""THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY DIRECT THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO THE APPELLANT'S LIABILITY BASED ON JOINT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE""

26This objection was not taken at the trial. Accordingly, the appellant needs leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground.

27The appellant submitted in relation to this ground that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that it needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that AC's conduct in punching Mr Purdon was done in pursuance of the understanding, arrangement or agreement to which the appellant and AC were parties, such that it could be said that the appellant and AC were acting in concert in relation to that act. 

28I do not accept this submission. In my view the trial judge made this requirement clear at a number of points in his Summing-Up, including in the following passage:

""If you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was this arrangement or understanding or agreement between, in particular the accused and [AC], that physical violence would be perpetrated or visited upon Mr Purdon and that [AC] in punching Mr Purdon in the way in which he did, was acting as part of that understanding or arrangement or agreement, then the Crown will have established its case. That is what the Crown has to establish beyond reasonable doubt before you could convict the accused"" (emphasis added). (Transcript 10 September 2010, p 10).

29In these circumstances I do not consider that a grant of leave under r 4 in relation to this ground of appeal is warranted.

GROUND 2 - ""THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO DIRECT THE JURY THAT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE CROWN ESTABLISH THAT, AS PART OF THE JOINT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE TO WHICH THE APPELLANT WAS A PARTY, THE APPELLANT AGREED THAT THE DECEASED WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO AN UNLAWFUL AND DANGEROUS ACT'

30This point also was not taken at the trial, with the consequence that leave under r 4 is required if the appellant is to be permitted to rely upon it.

31In the passage of the Summing-Up quoted in [24] above, the trial judge referred to the Crown case that there was a joint criminal enterprise ""to visit physical violence upon Mr Purdon"" and an understanding or arrangement that Mr Purdon ""would be physically assaulted"". He used these or similar expressions many times elsewhere in his Summing-Up. 

32The trial judge also said in his Summing-Up:

""Just to go back to the actual circumstances, the law provides, members of the jury, and it is common ground, that if you commit an unlawful and dangerous act upon another person and as a result that person dies, then you are guilty of the crime of manslaughter and it is not disputed here but that the punch thrown by [AC] was both unlawful and dangerous, as a result Mr Purdon died and therefore [AC] was guilty of the crime of manslaughter"" (Transcript 10 September 2010, p 10)

33At no point did the trial judge direct the jury that for an act to be ""dangerous"" for this purpose, it had to be one that exposed the victim to ""an appreciable risk of serious injury"" (Wilson v The Queen).

34On appeal the appellant contended, and the Crown did not dispute, that the Crown did not at the trial rely upon the principle of ""extended common purpose"". An explanation of that principle was given in Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; 81 ALJR 439 at [17] and adopted in R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at [7] as follows:

""The principle referred to in the second of the above paragraphs is sometimes described as ""extended common purpose"". In Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; 81 ALJR 439 at [17], the majority gave the following example: 

"" ... If a party to a joint criminal enterprise foresees the possibility that another might be assaulted with intention to kill or cause really serious injury to that person, and, despite that foresight, continues to participate in the venture, the criminal culpability lies in the continued participation in the joint enterprise with the necessary foresight"" (citations omitted).

35Under this principle, even if no agreement had been made to assault Mr Purdon in a manner that exposed him to an appreciable risk of serious injury, if the possibility of that occurring had been contemplated as part of an enterprise to visit some physical violence upon Mr Purdon, the consequence would have been that the commission of an act in fact exposing Mr Purdon to an appreciable risk of serious injury pursuant to that enterprise would have rendered each party to the arrangement liable for the consequences of the act. However, the Crown did not put its case in this way.

36As the Crown did not rely upon the extended joint criminal enterprise principle, it was necessary for the trial judge to direct the jury that it needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant and AC had an agreement or understanding that an act would be committed that exposed Mr Purdon to an appreciable risk of serious injury. A general agreement to assault Mr Purdon or ""to visit physical violence"" on him would not have sufficed. Performance of such an agreement would not necessarily have exposed Mr Purdon to the requisite level of risk of serious injury. 

37The agreement between the Crown and the appellant that the punch delivered by AC upon Mr Purdon was an unlawful and dangerous act did not in my view obviate the need for this direction. It could be argued that the jury would have inferred that the arrangement between the appellant and AC needed to be one that such an act should be committed, because it was instructed that the punch had to have occurred as part of the arrangement. A point of such importance, however, should not have been left to inference. It was critical that the jury appreciate the need for proof beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had agreed with AC that an act would be committed exposing Mr Purdon not simply to some physical harm but to an appreciable risk of serious injury.

38Leave should be given under r 4 to rely upon this ground. The omission in the directions related to a critical element of the offence with which the appellant was charged. In light of the factual circumstances of which evidence was given at the trial, proof of this element was essential in establishing the appellant's guilt. As Latham J (with the concurrence of Spigelman CJ and Kirby J) indicated in Ka Chung Fung v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 250; 174 A Crim R 169 at [48], deficiencies in directions relating to the elements of an offence are of particular importance and stand in a different category to other deficiencies raised on appeal. 

39For the same reasons I do not consider that this is a case in which the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies. In my view a substantial miscarriage of justice occurred here because the jury was not properly directed about a critical element of the offence with which the appellant was charged. Such a misdirection does not necessarily render the proviso inapplicable (Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; 194 CLR 202 at [23]; see also Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51 at [80] per Heydon J). However, the proviso will seldom be applied in circumstances where, as here, ""the jury were not sufficiently directed of the need to be satisfied to the requisite standard of an element of the offence being considered"": Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14 at [31].

40I add that in the course of her address on appeal, counsel for the Crown, very properly, conceded the existence of the error referred to above in the directions to the jury and did not deny that a substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred.

GROUND 5 - ""A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE [OF] THE EVIDENCE OF [RD] OF WHAT THE APPELLANT TOLD HIM IN RELATION TO GETTING INTO FIGHTS"" 

41It is convenient to deal with this ground before grounds 3 and 4. 

42Leave to raise this ground is necessary as objection to RD's evidence was not taken at the trial. 

43The evidence of RD (see [17] above) concerned statements made by the appellant ""at some time during the night"" of 20 February 2009 prior to the assault on Mr Purdon (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 214). It was in my view admissible as evidence of the appellant's state of mind at the time of the alleged offence. The evidence did not reveal, contrary to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995, a general tendency or propensity of the appellant to engage in the alleged conduct. Rather, it evinced ""a particular state of mind at a time so proximate to the time of the commission of the alleged offence as to permit an inference that the same state of mind continued up to the time of the offence"" (R v Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189; 106 A Crim R 510 at [30]). Evidence that the appellant and others had said ""Let's go after people and start fights"" was directly relevant to the existence of the alleged joint criminal enterprise between AC, AB and the appellant to assault Mr Purdon. Accordingly, although the evidence was not so significant as to form ""an inseparable feature of a unified sequence of events"" (LJW v R [2010] NSWCCA 114 at [45] per Hodgson JA), its proximity in time to the formation of the alleged enterprise rendered it admissible as ""evidence of a state of mind which could reasonably be inferred as having a probability of continuing ... to the time of the events alleged"" (ibid at [47]). The evidence was therefore admissible and leave to raise this ground of appeal should not be granted.

GROUNDS 3 AND 4: ""THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE THE EVIDENCE OF [JG] THAT THE APPELLANT TOLD HER HE 'ONLY GOES TO THE SHOW TO GET INTO FIGHTS'''AND ""A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE [OF] THE EVIDENCE OF [AS] THAT THE APPELLANT TOLD HER THAT 'FRIDAY NIGHT WAS FIGHT NIGHT'""

44The evidence of JG concerned a statement that had been made by the appellant in the week leading up to 20 February 2009 that he ""only goes to the show to get into fights"" (Transcript 1 September 2010, p 188). It suggested a tendency of the appellant to engage in violent behaviour (compare s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995). Given the time lapse between this statement and the assault on Mr Purdon, the evidence was neither referable to a ""connected series of events"" (O'Leary v R (1946) 73 CLR 566 at 577 per Dixon J), nor in my view sufficiently proximate to the assault to be probative of the appellant's state of mind at the time of the alleged offence (R v Adam at [30]). Accordingly, the evidence of JG should not have been admitted at trial.

45The evidence of AS concerned a statement that had been made by the appellant in the week leading up to 20 February 2009 that ""Friday was fight night"" (see [16] above). It was not in my view admissible. It did not reveal a propensity of the appellant towards violent conduct but if it had, it would have been precluded from admission on that basis by s 97 of the Evidence Act. Furthermore it was not sufficiently proximate to the formation of the alleged criminal enterprise to reveal anything relevant about the appellant's state of mind at that time.

GROUND 6: ""A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE FAILURE OF THE TRIAL JUDGE TO ADEQUATELY DIRECT THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO THE EVIDENCE THE SUBJECT OF GROUNDS 3, 4 AND 5""

46It is unnecessary to examine the alleged inadequacy of the trial judge's directions in this respect as I have already concluded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the deficiencies raised in Grounds 2 and 7(b). 

GROUND 7(a): ""A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE FAILURE OF THE APPELLANT'S COUNSEL TO CROSS-EXAMINE [AC] OR [AB] WITH RESPECT TO THE BENEFIT EACH RECEIVED FOR AGREEING TO GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE APPELLANT AND THE CONSEQUENCE FOR HIM OF NOT DOING SO""

47It is unnecessary to deal with this ground of appeal for the same reasons as I have given in relation to Ground 6. In addition, scrutiny of the appellant's counsel's cross-examination at the trial would neither assist me in deciding whether a new trial should be ordered nor facilitate the conduct of any new trial that takes place.

GROUND 7(b): ""A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WAS OCCASIONED BY THE ABSENCE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION OF [AC] [WITH] RESPECT TO PRIOR STATEMENTS MADE BY HIM IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF: 1. THE FAILURE OF THE CROWN TO COMPLY WITH S 137, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT, 1986 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THAT MATERIAL WAS NOT PROVIDED TO THE DEFENCE; OR, ALTERNATIVELY 2. THE FAILURE OF THE DEFENCE TO SUBPOENA THE COURT FILE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE PROCEEDINGS""

GROUND 8: ""THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN REFUSING TO GRANT LEAVE TO THE CROWN TO RE-OPEN ITS CASE TO RECALL THE WITNESS, [AC]""

GROUND 9: ""TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO DISCHARGE THE JURY HAVING DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE WITNESS [AC] TO BE RECALLED FOR FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION""

48These grounds relate to the Crown's non-disclosure to the appellant and his representatives of certain reports concerning AC that were in the Crown's possession prior to the trial. As the Crown accepted that it failed to comply with its obligations of disclosure under s 137 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 concerning those reports, it is unnecessary to refer to the evidence adduced on appeal as to how the non-disclosure came about. It is sufficient to note that the non-disclosure was inadvertent and arose out of the fact that at the time that the Crown was preparing for the appellant's trial it had on foot an appeal in relation to AC's sentence.

49The first report in question is a report prepared by officers of the NSW Department of Juvenile Justice and dated 31 July 2009. The report included the following in relation to an interview of AC:

""[AC] reported that the incident occurred due to being informed that two younger males had been 'pushed around' by adult males within the showground. [AC] stated his intention in approaching the victim was to verbally abuse him but stated he was aware a physical altercation may ensue. [AC] initially reported being angry due to the bullying but stated when the victim turned around and grabbed his arm and as a consequence his emotions turned to fear. His fear included being physically hurt as the victim was also surrounded by several mates"" (Report, p 2).

50AC's asserted statement to the Department that ""his intention in approaching [Mr Purdon] was to verbally abuse him"" stands in apparent contrast to AC's evidence given at the trial. The Crown put to the jury that the effect of AC's evidence was that the appellant and AC agreed that Mr Purdon would be physically assaulted and that AC punched Mr Purdon in pursuance of that agreement. AC may have had some explanation for the apparent inconsistency but certainly the statement attributed to AC in the report would have provided valuable ammunition for AC's cross-examiner in dealing with this critical part of AC's evidence. Acceptance of that evidence was fundamental to the success of the Crown case.

51AC's description of his fear of assault, in the statements attributed to him in the Department's report, would have provided support for an argument that AC punched Mr Purdon in self-defence rather than in pursuance of a pre-existing agreement to assault Mr Purdon (see also the evidence given by AC at the trial that ""I thought he was going to hit me"" at [9] above). This may well have assisted AC's cross-examiner in proving that AC did not throw the punch for the purpose of giving effect to the alleged joint criminal enterprise. 

52The second report of significance is the Psychologist's Report dated 15 January 2010 of Dr Christopher Lennings. Dr Lennings' Report included the following:

""By way of context, [AC] says he was approached by a few young people he knew who told him that a group of young men had roughed up his younger brother's mate ... [AC] says he was told this boy was in a bad way and this friends [sic] asked him 'have you got my back'. He said 'yes', in part because the boys were young and he was worried about them ... He said the boys went walking, and then [AC] became aware of a fight brewing and he called to the kids he was with to leave, in order to avoid a further provocation of what he saw as a tense situation. However, one of his friends spotted the alleged assailant of his friend across the road, and [AC] says he crossed the road to 'have a go' (that is tell off) this person [that is, Mr Purdon] for having a go at his brother's mate. He says he grabbed this person on the shoulder, the victim grabbed his hand, he [thought] the victim was going to punch him so he punched him first ... "" ([15]).

53The statement attributed to AC that he crossed the road to ""'have a go' (that is tell off)"" Mr Purdon again stands in apparent contrast to AC's evidence at the trial that the Crown contended indicated that he punched Mr Purdon to give effect to the alleged joint criminal enterprise. The admission that ""he [thought] the victim was going to punch him so he punched him first"" provides further support for an argument that AC assaulted Mr Purdon in self-defence rather than in pursuance of a joint criminal enterprise to assault him (see [52] above).

54The appellant was in my view seriously disadvantaged by not having this material available for use by his counsel in cross-examination. As was the case in Grey v R [2001] HCA 65; 75 ALJR 1708, it is ""not difficult to imagine a fertile area of cross-examination that could have been tilled by the appellant on the basis of this [evidence] ... Its revelation and admission into evidence could have put a quite different complexion on the case for the appellant and the way in which it was conducted"" (at [18]). That disadvantage flowed from a breach of the Crown's duty of disclosure. In my view it resulted in a miscarriage of justice. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Crown, quite properly, did not deny that a miscarriage of justice had flowed from this breach of s 137.

55It follows that the appellant's conviction should be quashed on this basis, as well as upon the basis of ground of appeal 2. As Kirby J noted in Grey v R, ""[i]n cases where credibility is in issue and where the jury's assessment of the truthfulness of a vital prosecution witness might be important for their verdict ... the unavailability of significant and relevant evidence that later comes to light may, in a particular case, occasion such a miscarriage of justice that a guilty verdict should not stand"" ([55]). In my view, the present is such a case.

56In these circumstances it is unnecessary to examine in any detail whether any steps could and should have been taken at the trial to avoid this miscarriage of justice occurring, once the reports had come to the appellant's counsel's attention. That occurred on 9 September 2010 after the evidence, but not the final addresses, had been completed. It resulted from the delivery of this Court's judgment on the Crown's appeal against AC's sentence on 8 September 2010. That judgment quoted critical aspects of the reports. 

57The appellant then sought to have AC recalled for further cross-examination but the trial judge declined to permit this upon the basis that the new material did not ""make a great deal of difference to the overall issues"" (Transcript 9 September 2010, p 30.46). For reasons that are apparent from what I have said earlier, my view is that the material in the reports was, in fact, of considerable significance. 

GROUND 10: ""THE VERDICT OF THE JURY IS UNREASONABLE AND CANNOT BE SUPPORTED HAVING REGARD TO THE EVIDENCE""

58This ground has its foundation in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The High Court recently considered this ground in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. It is apparent from the judgment of the plurality in that case, and from the earlier decision in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, that the question for a court of criminal appeal when considering such a ground of appeal is not simply ""whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"" (M at 493 and SKA at [11]). The Court is also required to conduct its own ""independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"", and to assess whether, ""notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'"" (M at 492 - 3; SKA at [14]). 

59This requirement was reflected in the later reference in the plurality judgment in SKA to the ""central question"" as being ""whether on the evidence the Court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences"" (at [20]). 

60In light of my conclusion that the appellant's conviction should be quashed on other grounds, it is neither necessary nor desirable that I deal with this ground of appeal to the full extent dictated by SKA and M. In particular, as there were deficiencies in connection with the trial that resulted in a miscarriage of justice, it would be inappropriate for me to form and express a view, based upon what I find to have been a flawed trial process, on whether at the trial the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged.

61It is appropriate however that I consider the first aspect of the task identified in SKA and M, that is, whether on the evidence that was before the jury, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The answer is to this question is important in considering whether a retrial should be ordered because it should be assumed, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that the Crown would lead substantially the same evidence at a retrial as that which it led at the initial trial. If that evidence was not capable of sustaining a conviction, it would be inappropriate to order a retrial on substantially the same evidence: Gerakiteys v R [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 at 321. As was noted in R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 233 at [52], ""if the evidence is unchanged at the second trial, accused persons should not be placed in jeopardy of conviction by a second jury where an appellate court has found that the evidence was insufficient at the first trial"". Moreover, ""a new trial should not be ordered merely to give the prosecution an opportunity of mending its hand and presenting new evidence at the second trial which it failed to present at the first"" (ibid at [52]).

WHETHER A RETRIAL SHOULD BE ORDERED

62I have summarised earlier the presently relevant evidence given at the trial (see [8] - [20]). The only evidence led by the prosecution that was capable on its own of proving the alleged joint criminal enterprise was that of AC and AB. The remainder of the evidence was at best supportive and can for present purposes be put to one side. 

63Standing alone, AB's evidence might not be a satisfactory basis for ordering a retrial because, as noted earlier ([11]), AB conceded that he lied in various respects. In its submissions on appeal the Crown accepted ""that there were parts of [AB's] evidence (or evidence from others of [AB's] statements to them) that were seemingly inconsistent with other evidence"" (Written Submissions [107]).

64In a practical sense the Crown's case rested, and would rest again at a retrial, substantially on the evidence of AC. His evidence (see particularly [9] above), if accepted, was in my view capable of supporting the Crown's case against the appellant. I consider that it was open to the jury to take the view that the statement that AC attributed to the appellant that ""these 20 year old dudes just tried to fight me, I'm going back to get them"", was a statement of the appellant's intent to physically assault those persons. It was also open to the jury to conclude that AC's affirmative response to the appellant's question ""have you got my back?"", together with their movement and apparent search for Mr Purdon and the appellant's statement ""There he is. Let's go"" gave rise to a joint criminal enterprise to physically assault Mr Purdon in a manner exposing him to an appreciable risk of serious injury. Upon AC's evidence, it was open to the jury to conclude that AC threw the punch at Mr Purdon in pursuance of that joint criminal enterprise.

65In reaching these conclusions I have taken into account the hurdles the Crown would face at a retrial which would include the following. First, even if the jury accepted AC's evidence, it might not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such arrangement as was made between AC and the appellant contemplated physical assault on Mr Purdon or, if it did, that it contemplated an assault of such severity that it would expose Mr Purdon to an appreciable risk of serious injury. Secondly, the jury might reject AC's evidence on the basis that he had a strong motive to give evidence favourable to the Crown's case to avoid losing the discount in his sentence that he had received for assisting the police. Thirdly, the jury might take the view that the statements attributed to AC in the reports of the Juvenile Justice Department Report and Dr Lennings undermined his credit to such an extent that his evidence could not be accepted. There are other possibilities as well.

66Given my view that on the evidence led by the Crown at the first trial it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged, and given ""the desirability, if possible, of having the guilt or innocence of the [accused] finally determined by a jury"" (R v Anderson (1991) 53 A Crim R 421 at 453 per Gleeson CJ), it is my view that a retrial should be ordered.

ORDERS

67An order quashing the appellant's conviction was made on 16 February 2012. The appeal should be allowed and an order now made that the 
appellant be retried in relation to the charge upon which he stood trial before Judge Coolahan.

68RA HULME J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

69GARLING J: On 16 February 2012, I joined in the order made by the court quashing the appellant's conviction.

70I agree with the reasons of Macfarlan JA for the making of that order and the balance of the orders which he proposes.

2708398,Lawson v R [2012] NSWCCA 56,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  I agree with McCallum J.
2HARRISON J:  I agree with McCallum J.
3McCALLUM J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to two offences of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985.  The charges related to a quantity of methylamphetamine (907.5 grams) and a quantity of ecstasy (128 grams) respectively.  The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 20 years.  The offences carried a standard non-parole period of ten years under division 1A of part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
4On 23 September 2010 Coolahan DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows:
On count one (supply of methylamphetamine) to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of five and a half years and a balance of term of three and a half years.
On count two (supply of ecstasy) to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years and a balance of term of one and a half years.
5In passing sentence on count one, the judge took two additional offences into account, which were the subject of a Form 1, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  They were an offence of possession of a prohibited weapon (a butterfly knife) contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 and an offence of dealing with property ($8,020 in cash) reasonably suspected as being the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.
6The sentences were backdated to the date of the applicant's arrest and were wholly concurrent.  
7At the time the offences were committed, the applicant was serving a sentence by way of home detention for an offence of driving whilst disqualified.  The imposition of that sentence followed a long string of similar offences.  In entering into an agreement to serve that sentence by way of home detention, the applicant undertook to accept home visits by a supervisor at any time and to submit to searches as directed.  The drugs were found in the applicant's home during a search conducted in accordance with that agreement.  
8The methylamphetamine was found in a small freezer in the wardrobe of the applicant's bedroom.  The drug was contained in 37 resealable plastic bags each containing approximately an ounce of powder.  The supervisor conducting the search then called for assistance from police who conducted a more extensive search of the premises.  Police found $8020 in cash hidden between the cushions of a lounge chair.  That was the basis of the first offence on the Form 1.  They also found two mobile telephones, two sets of electronic scales and two packets of unused plastic resealable bags.  
9Within the roof cavity of the house, police found the ecstasy consisting of a large number of purple tablets in a single, vacuum-sealed plastic bag.  Another bag of orange-coloured pills was located but, upon analysis, they proved not to be a prohibited drug.  An examination of the mobile telephones revealed a number of text messages to and from the applicant disclosing dealings in drugs.  
10The applicant's grounds of appeal were drawn, and the written submissions prepared, before the publication of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39.  Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant were in some respects overtaken by that decision.  
11The first ground of appeal is:
His Honour erred in constructing both sentences, taking into consideration part 4, division 1A and s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act together with the common law.
12The burden of the submission put in support of that ground was that the learned sentencing judge failed to take into consideration statistics from the Judicial Commission ""as well as the emerging pattern in the range of sentences imposed in matters involving similar conduct"".
13A failure to have regard to the statistics published by the Judicial Commission does not in itself amount to error in the sentencing process.  Authority in support of the applicant's submission was said to be found in the judgment of Kirby J in MLP v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 at [33] to [34].  The applicant noted that his Honour's judgment in that case had subsequently been described by this Court as a ""helpful summary of steps to be taken"" by a sentencing judge in considering the application of a standard non-parole period:  see Louizos v R, R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71 at [97].  Those decisions must now be read with caution in light of the principles stated by the High Court in Muldrock.
14In any event, the decision in MLP does not suggest that the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission are a mandatory consideration when passing sentence.  What Kirby J said at [33] in MLP was that the judge must at some point address a number of issues including:
First, what term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the offender?  Guidance may be provided by the maximum penalty, statistics from the Judicial Commission and the collective wisdom emerging from a range of sentences involving similar conduct.
15As noted on behalf of the Crown, the statistics for the offences in question were not tendered or provided to the judge at the proceedings on sentence and there is no suggestion that his Honour was invited to consider such statistics.  To the extent that statistics were referred to in the submissions on appeal, they did not demonstrate that the sentences imposed were outside the statistical range.  
16I am not satisfied that any error is established on the basis of ground one.  
17Ground two is:
His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences.
18The judge said:
It was the submission of Mr Kidd [the Crown] that the offence involving the supply of methylamphetamine was at the mid level of objective seriousness or just above and that the offence involving the supply of the MDMA was just below the mid level.  Mr Booth [for the offender] agreed with those assessments.
So far as the objective seriousness of the offences are concerned, I also agree with those assessments.  I am of the view that the supply of methylamphetamine was at the mid level of seriousness or thereabouts.  As I say, a large amount was involved, close to the large commercial quantity.  It is obvious that the offender was actively dealing in this drug.  The drug was not being dealt with at street level amounts but was packaged in one ounce packages and, for these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that that offence falls to be determined at the mid level of seriousness.
So far as the other offence is concerned, the amount of drug was much lower, there was no actual packaging, it is not quite clear what amounts were being supplied and, for those reasons, I would have thought that that offence fell to be determined just below the midpoint of seriousness. [Remarks on sentence, p 11]
19It should be noted that, following the decision of the High Court in Muldrock, there is no requirement for the Court to proceed to an assessment of whether an offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness: at [25].  It may nonetheless be accepted that it remains important for the Court to assess the objective criminality of the offence.  
20The applicant submitted that the learned sentencing judge erred in using the amount of the drug involved and the manner of packaging as the principal considerations on the question of the objective seriousness of the offences, citing R v MacDonnell (2002) 128 A Crim R 44.  
21I do not think the judge fell into error in that respect.  In MacDonnell, Wood CJ at CL accepted that the criminality of the offending cannot be determined merely by reference to the quantity of the drugs in question:  at [33], Sully and Dowd JJ agreeing at [60] and [61] respectively. In the present case, the judge considered the quantity of the drug and the way in which it was packaged as factors pointing to the kind of dealing in which the applicant was engaged.  His Honour said:
Whilst there is no evidence and nor could it be said that the offender was a Mr Big or principal in the drug dealing milieu, in my view he was a mid level drug dealer who was supplying drugs in significantly larger portions than street deals and, in my view, substantially for profit.
22His Honour's reasoning on that issue was well open on the evidence before him.  The offender had acknowledged in cross-examination that he was ""dealing in large amounts"".  His plea of guilty to the offence of dealing with the $8,020 in cash reasonably suspected as being the proceeds of crime was significant in that context.  I am not persuaded that the judge's remarks on sentence reveal any error in the assessment of the level of criminality involved in the offences.
23Ground three is:
His Honour failed to take into consideration the relevant mitigating factors required pursuant to s 21A(1); s 21A(3); s 54B in addition to the applicant's mental state.
24The applicant submitted that the learned sentencing judge did not consider any mitigating circumstances of the applicant when determining the appropriate non-parole period.  Two mitigating factors listed in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were identified as having been erroneously overlooked.  Separately, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge did not take into account the applicant's mental health.
25The first matter relied upon under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was the submission that the sentencing judge failed to take into consideration evidence as to the prospects of the applicant's future rehabilitation.
26The applicant accepted that the judge considered the issue of rehabilitation in the context of finding special circumstances such as to warrant a departure from the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the balance of term prescribed in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The judge said:
So far as mitigating factors are concerned, I cannot say that the offender has good prospects for rehabilitation but I accept that he has a need in this regard.
27In those circumstances, as noted on behalf of the Crown, this ground cannot succeed unless the applicant demonstrates that the judge fell into error of the kind identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.
28In my view, it was open to the sentencing judge to decline to make the finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.  There was evidence before the judge that the applicant had an extended history of using illicit drugs and that a previous attempt at rehabilitation, whilst helpful in the short term, had ultimately proved unsuccessful.  In cross-examination, the applicant had frankly acknowledged that he could give no assurance that upon his release he would not have another relapse into illicit drug use.
29The second matter relied upon under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was remorse.
30As with the first factor, this aspect of ground three overlooked the need to demonstrate error of the kind identified in House v The King.  The applicant acknowledged that, in accordance with s 21A(3)(i), remorse may only be taken into account as a mitigating factor if the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions and the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions and made reparation for such injury, loss or damage. 
31It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his evidence at the proceedings on sentence, taken together with the report of the psychologist, Dr Kate Seidler, ""met both limbs required"" and that remorse should accordingly have been taken into consideration in the formulation of the sentence.  However, whether or not a different approach could have been taken to the issue of remorse, it cannot be said that the approach taken by the sentencing judge was not open.  As noted on behalf of the Crown, the psychologist's report revealed that the applicant's regret for his behaviour was in large part self-focussed.  Separately, the judge doubted the applicant's evidence as to his role in the offences, describing it as ""totally unconvincing"".  In my view, it was plainly open to the judge to decline to make a finding in favour of the applicant on the issue of remorse.
32The final factor relied upon by the applicant as having been overlooked by the sentencing judge was the applicant's mental health.  The uncontested evidence at the proceedings on sentence was that, as a child, the applicant was subjected to prolonged and sustained sexual abuse at the hands of his stepfather.  Most troubling was his evidence that he had first been introduced to the use of cannabis by that man as a tool of seduction or form of bribery for the applicant's silence.
33The history of those events, recited at length in the psychologist's report, is extremely sad.  Assuming the allegations are true, which was not doubted at the proceedings on sentence, I have no doubt that those events would have had an extremely detrimental impact on the applicant and, in particular, the development of his dependence on illicit drugs.
34It is trite to observe, however, that the role of this Court is confined to correcting appellable error. 
35The applicant submitted that it was not ""apparent"" that any subjective element of the psychologist's report was taken into account by the judge when formulating the non-parole periods.  Counsel for the applicant submitted that ""there is a nexus, at least in part, between the mental condition and the offending behaviour"".  
36The sentencing judge expressly referred to the psychologist's report and rejected the existence of any significant causal relationship between the history of sexual abuse and the offences.  The judge said:
The reality is whilst I am prepared to accept that the offender was sexually abused at a young age and whilst this may have, in turn, led to his use of an addiction to illegal substances, I am not persuaded that it had any real effect on his deciding to sell these substances for profit and nor for him to be involved at such a significant level as to be supplying commercial quantities of the drug in the amounts which were found packaged. [Remarks on sentence, p 7.]
37Whilst it may be acknowledged that others may have reached a different conclusion on that issue, it cannot be said that his Honour's finding was not open on the evidence.  Whilst his Honour's reasons for reaching that conclusion were stated briefly, I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to have due regard to the applicant's mental state in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
38Separately, the applicant submitted that his mental state warranted a shorter non-parole period to enable issues of rehabilitation and mental health to be adequately addressed.
39As submitted on behalf of the Crown, any departure from the statutory proportion of the non-parole period to the balance of term is a matter of discretion.  The judge made a finding of special circumstances warranting some departure from the statutory ratio.  The applicant's submission is that the degree of departure should have been greater.
40In that context, it must be observed that the structure of the sentences imposed will allow the applicant a period of two and a half years supervision on parole.  That is a significant period.  It was open to the judge to conclude that no longer period of supervision was warranted.  I am not persuaded that any error is established in that respect.
41The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

		05 April 2012",2012-04-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708402,Butler v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 54,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him in respect of four charges of causing an unauthorised computer function with the intention of committing a serious indictable offence, namely stealing, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 308C(1).  The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 308C(1), which particularises stealing as the serious indictable offence, is imprisonment for 5 years:  see the Crimes Act, s 117.
2The s 308C(1) offences formed part of a series of offences, totalling over 300 in all, committed whilst the applicant was an employee of the Commonwealth Bank.  The other offences were as follows:
18 charges contrary to s 178BA(1) of obtaining money by deception.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 years imprisonment.One charge contrary to s 193B(3) of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime in the sum of $454,290.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment.A total of 294 charges contrary to s 178BA(1) and s 308C(1) dealt with pursuant to the Form 1 procedure:  see the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 33.
3The applicant commenced employment with the Commonwealth Bank on 25 October 2005 in the Group Security Section.  He was initially employed as a temporary employee.  He moved to the Direct Banking Section relatively quickly and was employed in a full-time position in January 2007.  He was promoted to assistant team leader and was responsible for making decisions and managing staff.
4During the time he worked in the group security section, he was given access to parts of the bank's computer systems which enabled a verification of its client's details.  From late 2008, he began to defraud the bank and its clients by assuming client identities and obtaining credit cards in the names of these clients.  
5The applicant's conduct came to notice as a result of the bank discovering similar conduct by another person.  He was arrested on 5 November 2010.  When interviewed by police he made full and frank admissions to the offences with which he was originally charged.  As a result of the applicant's conduct, the bank was required to reimburse the client victims of the fraud in the amount of $454,290, being the amount involved in the s 193(B)(3) offence.
6The applicant pleaded guilty at the Penrith Local Court on 7 May 2010.  He was remanded to the District Court, where he adhered to his pleas of guilty.  He was sentenced by Robison DCJ on 10 September 2009.  His Honour imposed the following sentences:
(i) On each charge contrary to s 178BA(1) to imprisonment for a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 9 September 2010 and expiring on 8 September 2013.  His Honour declined to set a non-parole period because the structure of the sentences to be imposed made it inappropriate.  His Honour stated that in each of the matters the Form 1 had been taken into account.
(ii) On each charge contrary to s 308C(1) to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 8 December 2010 and expiring on 7 December 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years imprisonment expiring on 7 December 2015.
(iii) On the charge contrary to s 193B(3) to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 8 December 2010 and expiring on 7 December 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years imprisonment expiring on 7 December 2015.
7The total effective sentence was 5 years and 3 months comprised of a total effective non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months commencing on 9 September 2010 and expiring 7 December 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 7 December 2015.  In imposing sentence, his Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount for the full utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea.
8The applicant was 37 years of age at the time of sentence. His Honour observed that the applicant experienced a very troubled childhood, characterised by physical, mental and sexual abuse at the hands of his father.  His mother died when he was 10 years of age.  The applicant had developed a serious gambling problem which commenced when he was about 20 years of age.  This was accompanied by illicit drug addiction from about the age of 25.  
9According to the Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report, the applicant attributed his conduct to an attempt to mask the personal pain experienced as a result of his abusive childhood.  He believed that his gambling and drug addictions spiralled out of control to the point that he became involved in offending behaviour in order to finance his addictions. However, he eventually became addicted to the financial benefit of his criminal behaviour and began to use the proceeds to purchase personal items and gifts for family and friends.  The applicant developed suicidal thoughts prior to his sentence and was referred to the Blacktown Community Mental Health Team, where he came under treatment for what was described as his ""tenuous mental health"".  The probation and parole officer considered that the applicant may require ongoing and long-term support in order for him to deal with the complex life issues affecting him.
10The trial judge accepted that the applicant had an ""absolutely horrific upbringing"".  Notwithstanding that, up until the time of the commission of these offences, the applicant had a steady employment history and he was supported by strong testimonial evidence.  His Honour accepted the applicant was remorseful for his conduct.  His Honour considered the applicant clearly needed help and rehabilitation and that he would not be able to do that on his own.
11His Honour categorised the applicant's offending conduct as involving a serious breach of trust, not only in respect of the bank but also in relation to its customers.  He accepted that the applicant's addictive gambling habit was the essential motivation for his criminal activity.  The applicant had offered reparation but his Honour was not able to determine whether that was realistically achievable.
12His Honour took into account the need for general deterrence which he considered ""loom[ed] large"".  In terms of objective seriousness, his Honour considered that the offending was at least in the mid range of seriousness and perhaps towards the high end of the range.  A sentence of imprisonment was inevitable on his Honour's assessment.  His Honour found special circumstances.
The issues on the appeal
13The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds:
(a) The learned sentencing judge was misled and consequently erred by stating that the maximum penalty for an offence pursuant to s 308C(1) was 10 years imprisonment when it was 5 years.
(b) The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to give a discount for the pleas of guilty entered for the offences pursuant to s 308C(1).
(c) The sentencing judge erred by imposing the maximum penalty for the offences pursuant to s 308C(1).
(d) The sentence imposed for the s 308C(1) offences and in total is manifestly excessive.
14The Crown conceded that the trial judge incorrectly stated the maximum penalty in relation to the s 308C(1) offence as 10 years rather than 5 years imprisonment.  The error arose as a result of misinformation given to the court by the Crown.  It follows that ground (a) of the application to appeal against sentence must be allowed.
15The consequence of his Honour's error was that his Honour imposed a sentence of 5 years imprisonment for each of the s 308C(1) sentences.  The maximum penalty is one that is reserved for cases that fall into the worst category of case for the offence in question.  The Crown conceded that this case did not fall into that category of offences nor did his Honour make a finding to that effect.  Accordingly, ground (c) should be allowed.
16A further effect of the imposition of the maximum penalty for the s 308C(1) offences was that the applicant was not given the benefit of the 25 per cent discount in respect of these offences that his Honour otherwise considered should be afforded for the utilitarian value of the early pleas of guilty.  It follows that ground (b) must also be allowed.
17The Crown conceded that given these errors, the sentence in respect of the s 308C(1) offences was manifestly excessive and that it could not be said that no lesser sentence was warranted at law:  the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3).  However, the Crown contended that although the sentence for those offences required adjustment, the total effective sentence should not be reduced.  The Crown accepted that the Court needed to re-sentence and submitted that in re-sentencing, the following matters were relevant: 
There is no applicable standard non-parole period.Each of the offences had Forms 1 attached listing offences to be taken into account.The commission of each of the s 308B(1) offences was planned and organised over a significant period of time and involved significant breaches of trust.A 25 per cent discount is appropriate as the pleas were entered in the Local Court.The applicant was found to be remorseful.Special circumstances were found and the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence for each offence was altered to be 60 per cent.The applicant had a criminal history but it did not at the time of sentencing contain offences for dishonesty.The relevant subjective features were set out by his Honour at 4-6 of his remarks on sentence.General deterrence is a very significant factor.
18In oral submissions, the Crown emphasised the second of these matters, namely, that each of the s 308C(1) offences had Form 1 offences attached to it, but that the trial judge had failed to take those offences into account.  In total, there were 42 offences contained in five separate Form 1 Notices.  
19There is no doubt that this Court needs to re-sentence the applicant in respect of the s 308C(1) offences.  The ultimate question for the Court's determination is whether that should result in a reduced overall sentence.  I will turn to that shortly.  Before doing so, it is necessary to refer to the applicant's conduct and circumstances whilst he has been in prison.
20The applicant filed an affidavit, affirmed on 19 March 2012, upon which he seeks to rely.  In his affidavit, he describes his period in custody as having been ""distressing"".  However, he stated that he was determined to make the best of his circumstances by focusing on self-improvement through education and participation in employment opportunities.  In this regard, the applicant has held several employment positions, namely Education Clerk, Clerk to the Assistant Superintendent of Industries and Clerk to the Manager of Industries.  The applicant is currently employed as a clerk in the Affordable Housing Department, which involves building houses for the Aboriginal community. 
21In addition, the applicant has completed a number of TAFE courses, including Responsible Conduct of Gambling.  He has also attended a two-day gambling awareness workshop and weekly Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and Gambling Anonymous classes.  He has also completed the ""Getting Smart"" 12 step recovery programme which he considers has given him skills to take into the future.
22The applicant has the continuing support of close friendships as well as family support, although the latter has been constrained by the poor health and financial circumstances of his brother and sister. 
23Senior counsel for the applicant did not contest that the factors listed by the Crown (see at [17] above) were relevant to re-sentencing.  However, he submitted that there had been double counting of the criminality involved in the s 178BA(1) offences and the offence pursuant to s 193B(3).  He contended those offences involved the same effective criminality, as the amount involved in the s 193B(3) offence was the total of the individual amounts concerned in the s 178BA(1) offences.  There is a point in this submission.  The s 193B(3) offence represented the totality, in dollar amount, of the applicant's offending under s 178BA(1).  Although properly chargeable as a separate offence, the s 178BA(1) offences were the occasions upon which the applicant obtained funds which he then spent on his own purposes.  
24In my opinion, that is a sufficient reason for the Court to reduce the sentence.  In addition, when considering totality, his Honour would have had to take into account the sentence he imposed in respect of the s 308C offences.  The significant reduction in the sentences now imposed for those offences impacts upon an assessment of the totality of sentences imposed.  That provides an additional reason why the overall sentence in this matter should be reduced. 
Re-sentence
25I am of the opinion that the appropriate sentence on each of the s 308C(1) counts is imprisonment for a fixed term of 24 months.  As the trial judge said, the applicant's conduct involved a serious breach of trust.  However, there are compelling subjective circumstances to which regard must be had as well as the attempt the applicant has made to date to rehabilitate himself.  Allowance must also be made for his early plea.  In this regard, I would apply the same 25 per cent discount as did the trial judge.  The offences were objectively serious but an assessment as to precisely where they lie in the hypothetical range is not required:  see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [25].  In this case, the objective seriousness of the offence is to be discerned from the number of individual occasions of offending, the period over which the offending occurred and the amount involved.
26The question which next arises is how the overall sentences should be structured.  The trial judge's sentencing provided for an accumulation of 3 months between the s 178BA(1) offences on the one hand and the s 308C(1) offences and the s 193B(3) offence on the other.  On this sentencing structure, the s 308C(1) offences and the s 193B(3) offence were made concurrent.  The sentence for the s 178BA offences expired on 8 September 2013.  The non-parole periods for the s 308C(1) offences and the s 193B(3) expired on the same date, namely, in 7 December 2013 and the balance of term in respect of each expired on 7 December 2015. 
27Whilst there was no error in the manner in which the trial judge structured the sentences, given the view I have expressed at [19], it has become necessary to restructure the way in which the sentences for the s 178BA(1) and s 193B(3) offences are imposed.
28Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
1. Grant leave to appeal;
2. Appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the s 308C(1) offences be allowed;
3. Set aside the sentences imposed by the trial judge and in lieu thereof, sentence the applicant as follows: 
(i) On each charge contrary to s 308C(1) the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 9 September 2010 and expiring on 8 September 2012;
(ii) On each charge contrary to s 178BA(1) the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 9 September 2010 and expiring on 8 September 2013;  
(iii) On the charge contrary to s 193B(3) the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 9 September 2010 and expiring on 8 September 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years imprisonment expiring on 8 September 2015.
29HARRISON J:  I agree with Beazley JA.
30McCALLUM J:  I agree with Beazley JA.

		10 April 2012",2012-04-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708411,Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R S HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J and with his Honour's reasons.

3R A HULME J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court at Parramatta by his Honour Judge Sides on 11 April 2011. 

4The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of supplying heroin and was committed for sentence. She adhered to that plea in the District Court and asked that three further offences listed on a Form 1 document be taken into account: one of dealing with the proceeds of crime and two of supplying other prohibited drugs.

5The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 9 April 2011. 

6The maximum penalty for supplying a prohibited drug, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of $220,000.

Facts

7The applicant lived with her mother and daughter in a townhouse in Fairfield. Police conducting surveillance on 29 January 2010 saw her drive away from her home with a male passenger. She drove to Heckenberg and then to Fairfield where there was activity that seems to have given rise to, or confirmed, a police suspicion that she was involved in the supply of drugs.

8A search warrant was executed at the applicant's home on 1 February 2010. Her bedroom was searched after she had told police that she had nothing to declare. 22.8 grams of a rock like substance containing heroin was found in a bag in a chest of drawers. Four balloons were found in a box on the floor that contained an aggregate of 112.3 grams of heroin at 24.5 per cent purity. The total amount of heroin was 135.1 grams. The traffickable quantity and indictable quantity prescribed in respect of heroin is 3 grams and 5 grams respectively. The commercial quantity is 250 grams.

9Cash was found in three separate locations in the bedroom, including in a locked safe. The total amount was $14,820 (item 1 on Form 1).

10Also found within the safe and the chest of drawers were 36 tablets containing ketamine with a combined weight of 12.64 grams (item 2 on Form 1) and 20 tablets containing methylamphetamine with a combined weight of 3.81 grams (item 3 on Form 1). The traffickable and indictable quantities prescribed for ketamine are 7.5 grams and 12.5 grams respectively. The traffickable and indictable quantities for methylamphetamine are the same as for heroin.

11Police also found multiple resealable plastic bags, a set of scales, a pair of scissors, and numerous books and pieces of paper with writing that appeared to be drug ledgers. 

12The applicant denied knowledge of the drugs and the money. She admitted the safe was hers and produced the key to open it. She exercised her right to silence when police later sought to interview her at the police station.

Subjective circumstances

13The applicant was born in China in either 1977 or 1979. She has two older brothers. An adopted sister died through illness about four years ago. The applicant told Ms Kathryn Wakely, psychologist, that she had ""a great life"" in China. Her mother worked and her father stayed at home to care for the children. The applicant was very close to her father but had a difficult relationship with her mother. The family came to Australia when the applicant was aged ten.

14The applicant's father was diagnosed with terminal cancer within six months of the family's arrival in Australia. Her parents returned to China, leaving the applicant and the youngest brother at home to fend for themselves for some months. Her father ultimately died and her mother then returned to Australia.

15The applicant's relationship with her mother remained poor. She was subjected to abuse in varying forms and ran away from home on a number of occasions. At the age of 17 she commenced a relationship that lasted for about 10 years and produced a daughter who is now aged 13. The evidence before the judge was to the effect that the applicant was not prepared to leave her daughter in the care of her mother while she served her sentence; it was proposed that she would be sent to live with one of the applicant's brothers in Perth. 

16The applicant's school performance was adversely affected by the problems she experienced with her mother and she left part way through Year 11. She has limited vocational skills and employment experience. There was, however, evidence that she was motivated to obtain skills in order to play a more active role in the workforce.

17The applicant was on a disability support pension. A letter from her general practitioner, Dr Devsam, reported that she suffered from recurrent lumbar spine pain due to degeneration of the spine. The doctor also reported that she had a history of depression and anxiety dating back some years. This was exacerbated by her difficult relationship with her mother, as well as by her back pain. Ms Wakely noted in her report that anxiety and depression had been diagnosed three years previously. Psychometric testing indicated that these conditions were both current and problematic. Ms Wakely also noted symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 

18The applicant commenced using heroin at the age of 17. She had been able to abstain at times but relapsed about 12 months before her arrest. She ceased using drugs following her arrest, entered a methadone program and commenced a program of counselling.

19This brief summary of the applicant's subjective case has been largely drawn from the judge's sentencing remarks. His Honour also said that he was satisfied her prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending were ""reasonable to good"". A 25 per cent reduction of sentence was allowed because of the applicant's early plea of guilty. The judge was also satisfied that she was remorseful.

20There are three grounds of appeal but before turning to them it would be convenient to set out a portion of the judge's sentencing remarks that is relevant to the first two grounds. After dealing with the facts and the applicant's personal circumstances, His Honour said:

It seems to the Court that [it] is highly likely that she used drugs to address the poor relationship between her and her mother, her mental health issues as well as her physical pain.

The evidence discloses that she suffers from depression and anxiety. However, there is no evidence that, at the time of the offence, she did not know what she was doing and did not fully appreciate the consequences of her conduct. The Court is satisfied that, in combination with the separation from her daughter, her mental health issues will make any time in custody more burdensome for her.

She became involved in the offence to fund her own habit and to provide her mother with money that the mother had demanded so she could visit China and support her gambling addiction. Because of the Offender's mental health issues she would have been vulnerable to pressure from her mother.

The Court is satisfied that the offence was premeditated and the Offender must have appreciated that, by becoming involved in the offence, she was enmeshing herself in organised criminal activity.

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to adequately take into account the Applicant's mental health condition at the time of the commission of the offence.

21The applicant did not give evidence and so the material concerning her mental condition was confined to the letter from the general practitioner and the report of the psychologist. Counsel for the applicant noted that the evidence was not challenged. It was submitted that the applicant was ""entitled to have these mental conditions taken into account when assessing her moral culpability"". Even if not found to be causative of the offending they remained relevant to sentence: TC v R [2009] NSWCCA 296 at [68] per Hall J; Benitez v R [2006] NSWCCA 21 at [36] - [38] per Simpson J.

22Counsel for the applicant referred to the authoritative summary of principles concerning the relevance of a mental disorder in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177] - [178] per McClellan CJ at CL. He also referred to the statement of McClellan CJ at CL and Howie AJ in Watts v R [2010] NSWCCA 315 at [24] that the relevance of an offender's mental disorder transcends a matter of mitigation under s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender's age or any disability"").

23It was submitted that, having regard to the content of the reports, the judge's ""comments about the applicant's mental health condition do not reflect that he gave adequate weight to the extent of the applicant's mental health problems at the time of the commission of these offences so as to reflect the degree of moral culpability that should attach to her conduct"" (AWS [38]). In oral submissions, it was put that the applicant's mental condition was relevant to an assessment of her moral culpability, and therefore the seriousness of the offence, as well as to the degree to which the sentence should reflect general deterrence and denunciation.

24The Crown did not dispute the principles to be applied in sentencing an offender who suffers from a mental disorder. It was noted, however, that the applicant bore the onus of establishing that the effect of her mental condition was to reduce her moral culpability: see, for example, The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281.

25It was submitted that the expression of this ground tacitly conceded that the judge did take into account the applicant's mental condition at the time of the offence and that the complaint was directed to the weight that his Honour gave to this issue. The circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this Court are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]; Cao v R [2010] NSWCCA 109 at [57]; and R v Majid [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [40].

26The submissions for the Crown concluded with the contention that his Honour sufficiently referred to all relevant matters, made findings that were justified on the evidence, and adopted a principled approach to the issue of the applicant's mental condition.

Decision

27Two observations may be made concerning the submission that the judge should have found that the offence was less serious because of the applicant's reduced moral culpability. First, his Honour did not express any finding as to the level of seriousness of the offence, apart from saying that the applicant ""was involved in drug trafficking to a substantial degree"". That was a finding that was well open on the evidence regardless of any determination of moral culpability.

28Secondly, the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 85 ALJR 1154 at [27] appears to have rejected the notion propounded in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86] that matters personal to an offender, including a mental illness, can be said to affect the objective seriousness of an offence. I have said, ""appears to have rejected"", because it has not been universally accepted.

29In MDZ v R [2011] NSWCCA 243, Hall J (Tobias AJA and Johnson J agreeing) stated:

[67] In my opinion, in light of the High Court's judgment in Muldrock (supra), it is open to conclude that the mental condition of the applicant at the time of the offence may bear upon the objective seriousness of the offences: Muldrock (supra) at [27] and [29]. Certainly, in the present case, the sentencing judge, on the evidence, was required to expressly determine the moral culpability of the applicant in assessing the seriousness of the offences and in determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed in relation to them. In this case, the evidence required a finding that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced by his mental health issues.

30In Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 the point was referred to but not decided. Johnson J (Bathurst CJ and James J agreeing) said (at [39]):

To the extent that a question arises whether the Applicant's mental state at the time of the offence may bear upon objective seriousness (Muldrock at 1162-1163 [27], 1163 [29]), it remains a relevant factor on sentence in an assessment of moral culpability. Accordingly, if there is evidence to support a finding that an offender's moral culpability is reduced by a relevant mental condition, the offender is entitled to have it called in aid on sentence.

31There are first instance decisions that reflect different approaches. In R v Biddle [2011] NSWSC 1262 at [88], Garling J, with reference to Muldrock, specifically excluded from an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence the offender's mental health (an impaired capacity of the offender to control himself due to brain damage). 

32The point is not entirely clear, with respect, in the approach taken by Harrison J in R v Mohammed Fahda [2012] NSWSC 114. His Honour said:

[50] The objective seriousness of the offence is to be determined without reference to the personal attributes of the offender, but ""wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"": Muldrock at [27]. However, such factors remain particularly relevant to any determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

33Earlier, however, his Honour said:

[38] I accept that the offender suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder that was caused and evident prior to the commission of the offence and that this was associated with hyper-vigilance, paranoia, auditory hallucinations, depression and inverted sleep patterns. I also find that the offender was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder or an anxiety disorder and a probable psychotic illness. I have taken all of this into account in mitigation of the objective criminality of the offence.

34In R v Tuan Anh Tran [2011] NSWSC 1480 at [13], Rothman J took into account in an assessment of objective seriousness, ""circumstances personal to the offender that are causally connected to the commission of the offence such as his state of mind"". The ""state of mind"" he was speaking of does not appear to have been any mental condition. The case concerned a murder committed at a meeting between parties involved in an illicit drug transaction. The offender engaged another man (the actual killer) to provide protection because he was in fear of the deceased's notoriety for violence and it would appear that it was this that his Honour had in mind.

35In R v Cotterill [2012] NSWSC 89, McCallum J (at [30]) said that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence may include consideration of circumstances personal to the offender that are causally connected to the commission of the offence. Her Honour added that she did not understand Muldrock to hold otherwise. It was concluded (at [45]) that the seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the offender's impaired control due to several psychiatric disorders.

36Finally, I note that in R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [18], Basten JA said that Muldrock limits the range of factors to be considered in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 

37This issue in relation to Muldrock was not the subject of submissions by the parties and I have come to the view that it is unnecessary to decide. It would be a relevant matter if the contention was that the judge overestimated the seriousness of the offence. Aside from the finding that the applicant was involved in drug trafficking to a substantial degree, about which there was no criticism, his Honour did not otherwise express a view as to the relative seriousness of the offence. In these circumstances it is not possible to say that a finding was made that was not open on the evidence.

38That is not to say that an assessment of the applicant's moral culpability was irrelevant. If her moral culpability was reduced for the reasons advanced under this ground, it would have been necessary for the judge to assess its significance, along with all other relevant factors, in making a judgment as to the appropriate sentence to impose: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at 351 [51].

39It is correct, as counsel for the applicant submitted, that there was no challenge to the opinions expressed by Dr Devsam and Ms Wakely. A question was raised at the hearing of the application as to whether it would have been possible for the Crown to ""challenge"" the evidence, given that the applicant did not give evidence. I do not think anything turns on this because there was substantial consistency between what the applicant had said to Ms Wakely and what she had told Dr Devsam over a period of years.

40Dr Devsam reported that the applicant was ""frequently depressed and emotionally upset""; she had been ""counselled for anxiety and depression"" for the past three years; her back pain ""worsens her depression""; she had ""a long history of chronic depression for the last 5 years""; the problems in the relationship with her mother ""is aggravating her depression and anxiety""; and she ""often has panic attacks ... associated with severe anxiety"". There was no expression of opinion by the doctor concerning the connection between these conditions and the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced.

41The submissions for the applicant referred to Ms Wakely's opinion that depression would likely interfere with effective daily living. Ms Wakely also made reference to feelings of pessimism, guilt, hopelessness, worthlessness, low self worth and poor self-esteem. There were references to ""current difficulties""; for example, ""tension and difficulty relaxing, sadness, apathy and feelings relating to self doubt and being socially awkward"". There was a suggestion of a previous experience (with no detail as to what it was) that was ""intensely threatening and/or fearful"" to which the applicant had reacted ""by having uncontrolled and intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or nightmares"". Ms Wakely said that her testing confirmed that the conditions of anxiety and depression were current and problematic. The applicant's ""current"" levels of depression were of ""great concern"" and required attention and formal assistance. There was also evidence of symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

42It may be readily accepted that these various conditions were likely to have been present at the time of the commission of the offences. However, it does not necessarily follow that they operated to reduce the applicant's moral culpability. 

43His Honour referred to the evidence of the applicant suffering from depression and anxiety. He considered it highly likely to be one of the reasons she had been using illicit drugs. He found no evidence that the applicant did not know what she was doing, or did not fully appreciate the consequences of her conduct (the latter finding is the subject of the second ground of appeal). His Honour did take the applicant's mental condition into account, along with the separation from her daughter, in finding that any time in custody would be more burdensome.

44The judge found that the applicant's motive for supplying drugs was to fund her own habit, as well as to provide money that her mother had demanded from her to support her mother's gambling addiction and to fund a trip to China. His Honour acknowledged that because of her mental health issues, the applicant would have been vulnerable to pressure from her mother.

45The first of the principles referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa, supra, at [177] was that:

Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence...

46It is notable that the principle is concerned with a mental condition that contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way. Whether a mental condition is one that has had that effect is a question of fact. The sentencing judge in this case was not asked to make such a finding and I am unable to conclude on the evidence that was before his Honour that such a finding had to be made.

47In R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23], Spigelman CJ referred to a mental condition impacting upon the level of culpability of an offender where there was an inability to understand the wrongfulness of his or her actions, make reasonable judgments, or control his or her faculties and emotions. The evidence in the present case did not require a finding that the applicant had any such inability.

48The second of the principles set out by McClellan CJ at CL was that:

It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed... (Emphasis added).

49This is clearly a discretionary issue in the domain of a sentencing judge. In the present case, the judge was not invited to make such a finding. In fact, aside from a general reference to having taken into account the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, his Honour made no reference to general deterrence (or denunciation) at all. In those circumstances, it is difficult to conclude that inappropriate weight was given to any of the ""purposes"" listed in that section.

50It was submitted that when his Honour said ""there was no evidence that, at the time of the offence, she did not know what she was doing and did not fully appreciate the consequences of her conduct"", he was confining himself to whether the statutory mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(j) had been established. So, it was argued, his Honour made the same error identified in Watts v R, supra, at [24] of failing to recognise that ""the relevance of an offender's mental disorder transcends a matter of mitigation under this provision"".

51There would be force in this submission if it were the case that his Honour did not take the applicant's mental condition into account at all; but he did. In the extract from the sentencing remarks set out above, it is clear that he regarded it as one of two explanations for the applicant's recourse to drug use; it was part of the reason why custody would be more burdensome; and it was a reason why the applicant was vulnerable to pressure from her mother. These are all matters beyond a consideration of s 21A(3)(j).

52It was submitted for the applicant before the sentencing judge that special circumstances should be found ""because of the issues in the psychological report"" (POS at 10.11). Although his Honour did not expressly say so, I am inclined to the view that, when he referred to the applicant's ""strong subjective case"" as a reason for finding special circumstances, he had that submission in mind.

53The discretionary decision made by his Honour in light of the facts, matters and circumstances of the case was one that was uniquely for him. It was one that can only be interfered with by this Court on House v The King principles (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505). I am not persuaded that his Honour's discretion miscarried. Clearly, he was alive to the applicant's mental condition and he took it into account in a number of ways that were favourable to her. I would not uphold this ground.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in finding that there was no evidence that at the time of the offence the Applicant did not fully appreciate the consequences of her conduct.

54In the third of the four paragraphs quoted earlier from the sentencing remarks, his Honour was referring to a portion of Ms Wakely's report. Under the heading ""Background to the Offences"", it was said that around the time the offences took place the applicant was using heroin daily. She told Ms Wakely that because she was using she would not be at home and she provided an excuse to her mother that she was working. As a result, her mother expected her to be earning money. Her mother demanded $5,000 to cover the cost of a trip to China and to provide her with gambling money. The applicant told Ms Wakely that she began selling drugs in order to comply with her mother's demands and also to support her own drug use. 

55Counsel for the applicant referred to a statement made by the applicant to Ms Wakely to the effect that her mind was clear now that she was off drugs. Further, there was the response made by the applicant when asked about her attitude to the offences in which she said, ""My mind was not clear. It felt like a dream"". Ms Wakely expressed the opinion that the applicant's use of substances was ""likely to have impacted upon her ability to consider her actions appropriately and thoroughly given the enhanced lack of concern one will typically experience when under the influence of heroin"". 

56Counsel invited consideration of these statements in conjunction with the opinions that the applicant suffered from anxiety, depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the interaction of these conditions with drug abuse. Accordingly, it was submitted that the judge was in error in finding that there was no evidence that the applicant did not fully appreciate the consequences of her conduct and that she must have appreciated that ""she was enmeshing herself in organised criminal activity"". 

57Counsel for the Crown pointed out that in the submissions made on the applicant's behalf in the proceedings on sentence there was no suggestion that she did not appreciate the consequences of her conduct. The only submission concerning the applicant's mental condition was that there should be a finding of special circumstances.

Decision

58This ground may be dealt with briefly. At its highest, the evidence before his Honour was to the effect that the applicant's ability to think with clarity might have been impaired because of her drug use. The extent to which that might have been so was incapable of discernment. The combination of the applicant's drug use and her mental condition did not amount to evidence that she did not appreciate the consequences of her conduct. The findings made by the judge were open to him. I would reject this ground.

Ground 3: The sentence imposed on the Applicant is manifestly excessive.

59Counsel for the applicant calculated that with the 25 per cent reduction for the early plea of guilty there must have been a ""starting point"" for the head sentence of 6 years 8 months. Sentencing statistics tendered before the judge (supply heroin less than commercial quantity; Form 1 matters; plea of guilty) indicated that sentences had been imposed in 67 cases ranging up to 6 years. A 6 year sentence had been imposed in only 1 of those 67 cases with all other sentences being 5 years or less.

60A submission was made about the manner in which the judge rejected a claim made by the applicant to the author of the Pre Sentence Report that a significant proportion of the money and drugs found by the police were the property of some unnamed person, and that she was merely a temporary custodian of them while this person was away for a few days. It was submitted that the judge did not completely reject this explanation but that the sentence imposed reflected an implicit finding that the offender was ""a sole principal"". On the hearing of the application, however, counsel acknowledged the force of the written submissions for the respondent in relation to the manner in which the judge dealt with this issue and did not press the point (23.2.12 at T4.46). 

61It was submitted that the ""starting point"" for the sentence was too high, particularly having regard to the applicant's mental condition, and that this lead to the imposition of a sentence which was manifestly excessive. It was submitted that if the total term of the sentence was reduced, there should be a proportionate decrease in the non-parole period.

Decision

62To make good a ground alleging that a sentence is manifestly excessive it must be shown that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen, supra, at 371[25]. It is not simply a matter for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge because it might have exercised the discretion in a different manner: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 672 [15]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 339 [57]; and Markarian v The Queen at 371 [28]. Further, intervention by this Court on a ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive is not warranted simply because the sentence is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 538 [59].

63References to a ""notional starting point"" tend to deflect consideration from relevant matters and they have done so in this case. Hoeben J observed in Graham v R [2009] NSWCCA 212 at [40] that the focus should be on the sentence actually passed rather than on the starting point or notional sentence. An invitation to compare the ""notional starting point"" in this case with sentences actually passed in other cases by way of the statistics is to compare apples with oranges. Each of the 67 cases comprising the selection from the statistical database that was before the sentencing judge involved a plea of guilty. As a consequence, it could be expected that most, if not all, of those sentences were the result of a reduction of between 10 and 25 per cent. Counsel for the applicant acknowledged this in oral submissions, but maintained that the sentence actually passed was shown to be in ""the top 7% of cases"" (23.2.12 at T4.22).

64The statistics do not say anything, of course, about the circumstances of the offence, or the offender. For an offence of supplying less than the commercial quantity of heroin, they can range from an offer to supply a few grams to an actual supply of 249 grams. The offenders might be persons with no previous convictions who committed the offence in extenuating circumstances; persons well entrenched in drug supply activity with previous convictions spanning many years; or persons with subjective circumstances of infinite variety in between. Where further offences were taken into account, the statistics say nothing about the number, nature or seriousness of such offences. In the present case, it is significant that there were two further drug supply offences, as well as the offence of dealing with $14,820 worth of proceeds of crime, on the Form 1.

65A further point about the statistics is that nothing was said in the applicant's submissions about the non-parole period. The statistics before the sentencing judge showed that non-parole periods of 2 years or more had been imposed in 22 out of 61 cases (36 per cent). It is unsurprising that there was no submission that the non-parole period was manifestly excessive.

66His Honour did not express any conclusion that the applicant was a ""sole principal"". What he found to be relevant to the seriousness of the offence included:


There was no evidence that the applicant did not fully appreciate the consequences of her conduct.


The applicant's motivation was to fund her own habit and to provide her mother with money.


The offence was premeditated and the applicant must have appreciated she was enmeshing herself in organised criminal activity.


The quantity was about 45 times the traffickable quantity and 27 times the indictable quantity. It was about 54 per cent of the commercial quantity.


The 112.3 grams found in the four balloons had a purity of 24.5 per cent.


The presence of the other drugs indicated that her activity involved more than one illicit drug and it was clear that substantial profit was involved.


It was not clear whether all of the drugs would have been sold to users. The possibility that some might have been sold in wholesale quantities could not be excluded.


There was drug trafficking to a substantial degree.

67Although there was no express mention of it, the presence in the applicant's bedroom of the various paraphernalia associated with drug dealing (plastic resealable bags, scales and drug ledgers) provided further support for the finding as to the scale of the applicant's involvement in drug trafficking.

68This was a serious example of an offence of supplying heroin in an amount less than the commercial quantity. The judge was correct to find that there was drug trafficking to a substantial degree and that substantial profit was involved. The further offences to be taken into account were far from insignificant. Against a maximum penalty of 15 years, even taking into account the various matters in mitigation including the applicant's mental condition, I am not persuaded that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

69I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

2708415,Reardon v R [2012] NSWCCA 46,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Harrison J.
2HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Toner DCJ at Sydney on 13 August 2010.  The sole ground of appeal is that the difference in the sentences imposed on his co-offenders gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on his part.  For the reasons that follow I consider that leave to appeal should be granted but that the appeal should be dismissed.
3The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to four offences.  This appeal is only concerned with the sentence imposed by his Honour with respect to a charge that he knowingly took part in the manufacture of 5.877kg of methylamphetamine, being not less than the large commercial quantity for such a drug, contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. That offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  The standard non-parole period is 15 years.  
4The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years and 9 months commencing on 8 January 2009 and expiring on 7 October 2019 with an additional term of 4 years and 3 months expiring on 7 January 2024.  He was also sentenced on three additional counts.  His total effective sentence for the s 24(2) offence was therefore 15 years.  When his other sentences are taken into account the total effective sentence is 16 years with an effective non-parole period of 11 years.  Taking into account a discount of 25 percent for an early plea of guilty, this suggests a starting point for the subject offence of 20 years.
5The applicant contends that the sentence imposed by his Honour upon William Edmund Greenaway, and the sentences respectively imposed by Ashford DCJ on David McGreevy and Jake Callagher are so different to the sentence imposed upon him for the same offence that they give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on his part.  
6Mr Greenaway was sentenced to a non-parole period of 11 years, 7 months and 15 days with an additional term of 3 years, 10 months and 15 days.  That is an effective total sentence of 15 years and 6 months.   Taking into account a discount of 20 percent for an early plea of guilty, this suggests a starting point of 19 years and 4.5 months.
7Mr McGreevey was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 2 years.  That is an effective total sentence of 7 years.   Taking into account a discount of 50 percent for an early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities, this suggests a starting point of 14 years.
8Mr Callagher was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months with an additional term of 1 year and 6 months.  That is an effective total sentence of 6 years.   Taking into account a discount of 50 percent for an early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities, this suggests a starting point of 12 years.
Parity with Mr Greenaway
9His Honour described the applicant's role as follows:
""The offender was central to each of the offences contained in the two indictments.  He stood to gain financially from the manufacturing offence...Although the facts provide in essence only estimates as to the money that would have been generated, one merely has to point to the quantity of chemicals found by police when they executed the search warrant... and the sight [sic, 'site'] of the clandestine laboratory which was at the heart of Count 1, to realise the size of the operation.  The estimated street value of the methylamphetamine, which could have been extracted ranged from $500,000 to $2.7 million, depending on the size of the pseudoephedrine tablets and the processing of the methylamphetamine extracted from them.""
10His Honour's remarks on sentence for the applicant expressly indicate that he took into account the principles of parity and that he perceived the role of the applicant and Mr Greenaway to be the same.  He observed that there did not appear to be any relevant distinguishing features between the two men other than the application of different discounts for their pleas of guilty.  His Honour's remarks on sentence include the following comments:
""Further, as I have indicated in these reasons, I find that the role of the offender in relation to Counts 1 and 3 in the indictment for which he stands to be sentenced is the same as that of Greenaway and, accordingly, the sentence I propose to impose for each will be the same here to demonstrate principles of parity.
There does not appear to be any relevant distinguishing feature between the two of them.  They are about the same age.  Each of them has a chequered criminal history.  Each of them was motivated by greed and in each case there does not appear to be any matter that gives rise for a potential for finding special circumstances, other than as I have indicated in these reasons.
I should also note here and importantly, in terms of the arithmetic outcome, that Greenaway received a discount of twenty percent for the utilitarian value of his plea in relation to what is, in effect, Count 1 here where as his co-offender will receive a twenty-five percent discount for the utilitarian value of his plea.""
11The applicant complains that despite these comments it is clear that the starting point for the sentences is different.  He contends that this difference is ""inexplicable"" and that the starting point for both sentences should in these circumstances have been the same.  The applicant submits that this difference is an arithmetic error, that it is significant, and that it should now be corrected in his favour.
12Moreover, the applicant contends that there was in fact a basis upon which to distinguish between him and Mr Greenaway but that the difference favoured the applicant.  His Honour made a finding that there was a prospect that the applicant would succumb to the early onset of dementia and that his time in prison would be correspondingly harder for him.  The applicant contended that this should also have produced a starting point for his sentence that was lower than the starting point for Mr Greenaway's sentence.  He submitted that this difference was clearly overlooked by the sentencing judge.
13The Crown's response was to say that his Honour's quoted remarks were of a general nature and need to be understood in the context of other specific findings that he made.  Accepting that both men were of approximately the same age, both had criminal histories and both were motivated by greed, his Honour's remarks suggest that he regarded the applicant's criminal history as far more extensive that that of Mr Greenaway.  His Honour referred to Mr Greenaway's criminal history in the context of the subject offence as ""insignificant, consisting mainly of traffic offences and some minor drug matters many years ago"".  His Honour also found special circumstances in the case of the applicant and in that way took account of his concerns about the possibility of him experiencing the early onset of dementia.
14There was also a further point of distinction between the two men.  Even though his Honour found that the applicant was remorseful, he noted his inability to appreciate the consequences of his criminal behaviour.  That is to be compared with his Honour's remarks concerning Mr Greenaway in which he expressed the view that his remorse was genuine and unqualified and that he would not reoffend.
15The Crown also emphasised, in my view correctly, that the individual sentences imposed on the applicant must inevitably have been influenced by considerations of totality and the degree of concurrence and accumulation.  The applicant was being sentenced for four offences.  Mr Greenaway was being sentenced for only two offences.  His Honour ordered the sentences for Mr Greenaway's two offences to be served wholly concurrently.
16When his Honour sentenced the applicant he said that ""[t]he proper sentence for Count 1 is twenty years"".  When his Honour earlier sentenced Mr Greenaway he said, ""[w]ithout any discount the sentence that I would have imposed would have been twenty years imprisonment on Count 1"".  It remains unexplained why, in the light of the latter remarks, Mr Greenaway was not sentenced to an effective total sentence of 16 years instead of 15 years and 6 months.  The so-called error therefore appears in the calculation of Mr Greenaway's sentence rather than in his Honour's application of principles of parity.  That error would not in my opinion give rise in this case to a person in the position of the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance.  On the contrary, it may well have theoretically tempted a Crown appeal in Mr Greenaway's case to adjust his sentence to take account of the ""error"".
17More fundamentally, however, the difference in the sentences imposed is not such as in my opinion to attract this Court's intervention.  There is no single correct sentence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.  Moreover, the authorities make it clear that differences of a relatively small or insignificant degree will not attract the operation of the parity principles concerned.  The sentencing judge was required to sentence the applicant for four offences, whereas he was required to sentence Mr Greenaway for two offences.  Having regard to principles of totality, accumulation and concurrence, it is not remarkable that an instinctive synthesis approach to the sentencing exercise would produce sentences that differed in some small degree.  In this respect I am mindful of the comments of his Honour Blanch J in Lovoni v R [2011] NSWCCA 289 at [24] as follows:
""[24] It is evident from these authorities that a simple disparity is not enough and in order to attract appellate intervention it must be categorised as a manifest discrepancy in the sense of a difference that is clearly excessive...""
18We know from Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 and cases that have followed it that mere disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders is not of itself a ground for the intervention of an appellate court.  In the present case the only so-called disparity to which the applicant can point derives from the assumed or notional starting point for the two sentences.  If the calculation is applied to the applicant's sentence on the subject count it produces an effective head sentence for him of approximately 14 years 6 months and 10 days.  In the present case the disparity between that term, and the actual effective head sentence of 15 years that the applicant received, is not sufficient to attract intervention by this Court.
19I do not accept that the applicant is entitled to have a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the sentence imposed by his Honour upon the applicant's co-offender Mr Greenaway.
Parity with Mr Callagher and Mr McGreevy
20Her Honour Ashford DCJ sentenced Mr Callagher and Mr McGreevey for exactly the same offence.  They were co-offenders with the applicant.  The notional starting points for their sentences are 12 and 14 years respectively.  The applicant contended that this was in each case a significant difference that was not adequately explained by relevant material differences between these offenders and the applicant.
21Her Honour did not expressly compare the relative positions of Mr Callagher and Mr McGreevey to the applicant although her Honour's remarks do attempt to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences of Mr Callagher and Mr McGreevey.  Her Honour found that the objective seriousness of Mr Callagher's offence was below the mid-range and she accepted the submission that he was to some extent ""something of a gofer or labourer"".  Her Honour noted the Crown's concession that his involvement was more minor in that he was basically assisting Mr McGreevey.  Her Honour found that ""it was clear that [Mr Callagher] received no financial gain from his part in the operation but did receive some drugs"".  Mr Callagher was 29 years old with no prior criminal history.
22In contrast her Honour found that Mr McGreevey ""played a greater role in the offence than Callagher"".  Mr McGreevey's residence was identified as the premises where an active clandestine drug manufacturing laboratory was conducted.  He admitted that Mr Greenaway had offered him $5,000 for the manufacturing process to take place at his residence and also that he assisted in the assembly of the glassware and apparatus, brought a quantity of pseudoephedrine to the premises and conducted an extraction process.  Due to a lung infection he was unable to complete the process and Mr Callagher assisted him to do so.  Her Honour found that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the mid-range.  Mr McGreevey was 52 years at the time of the offence.  He had prior driving offences and in 1996 he had received a suspended sentence for his role in knowingly taking part in supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.
23His Honour did not in terms express a view about the objective seriousness of the applicant's offence on this count.  He found that the applicant's role ""was central"" to the offence but made no specific findings about that role other than that it was indistinguishable from Mr Greenaway.  The applicant submits that Mr McGreevey's role was also central: each performed different roles but both were critical to the enterprise.  He contended that if one put aside the discount for assistance the extent to which the roles of the applicant and Mr McGreevey differed did not justify a discrepancy of six years in the starting point for their respective sentences.
24I disagree.  Mr McGreevey and Mr Callagher played far less significant roles than the applicant.  When sentencing Mr Greenaway his Honour remarked that ""each ...were relatively minor participants"". This is reflected quite dramatically in what each stood to gain from the activity.  The applicant was in line for what may have been potentially a very considerable sum of money.  By way of contrast, Mr McGreevey was to be paid $5,000 and Mr Callagher was not to be paid in money at all.  His Honour Toner DCJ had a copy of her Honour Ashford DCJ's remarks on sentence and would have been aware of the way that her Honour characterised the respective roles of the co-offenders.  It is apparent that he did not take issue with her Honour's approach and by inference adopted her findings with respect to Mr McGreevey and Mr Callagher.  There were also differences in the criminal histories of the applicant and these co-offenders that did not favour the applicant.
Conclusion
25The differences in the sentences of the applicant and his co-offenders do not involve a marked disparity giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  I do not consider that a reasonable person looking at the circumstances in which each sentence was determined would regard the applicant's stated grievance as justified.    26McCALLUM J: I agree with Harrison J.

2708421,Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the orders he proposes. It has become common place for offenders to submit to this Court (for the first time) that when sentenced for an offence in the District Court the sentencing judge erred by failing to have regard to the possibility that the matter could have been prosecuted in the Local Court. In most cases the submission is misplaced, the circumstances of the offender or the offence making plain that it was appropriate for the matter to be dealt with in the District Court.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Abdallah Zreika, seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the District Court on 11 March 2011 on a charge of reckless wounding under s.35(4) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for seven years and a standard non-parole period of three years is specified. 

3Following a plea of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of one year and three months commencing on 17 February 2011 and expiring on 16 May 2012, with a balance of term of eight months commencing on 17 May 2012 and expiring on 16 January 2013.

Grounds of Appeal

4By application for leave to appeal filed 13 October 2011, the Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Ground 1 - her Honour erred in her application of Division 1A of Part IV of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ss.54A-D).

(b)Ground 2 - her Honour erred with regard to her decision not to impose an Intensive Correction Order (""ICO"").

(c)Ground 3 - her Honour erred in failing to take into account that the offence was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court.

The Course of Proceedings in the Local Court and District Court 

5Given the relevance of the Crown's charge selection to the third ground of appeal, it is useful to refer briefly to the course of proceedings in the Local and District Courts.

6The events for which the Applicant came to be sentenced occurred on 18 November 2009. The Applicant was arrested that day. In due course, on 5 May 2010, the Applicant was committed for trial from the Campbelltown Local Court upon a charge of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm under s.35(2) Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment with the standard non-parole period of four years. 

7On 28 May 2010, the Applicant was arraigned in the Campbelltown District Court upon an indictment containing two counts, the s.35(2) count with an alternative count of reckless wounding under s.35(4) Crimes Act 1900. The Applicant pleaded not guilty to both counts and the matter was listed for trial at that Court on 20 September 2010.

8An offence under s.35(2) is a Table 1 offence, as is an offence under s.35(4). It is clear that the Crown elected to prosecute the Applicant on indictment: s.262 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

9It is apparent that plea negotiations took place between the parties between May and September 2010.

10On 20 September 2010, the Crown presented a fresh indictment containing only the reckless wounding charge, to which the Applicant pleaded guilty. Thereafter, on 2 December 2010, the Applicant came before her Honour Judge Syme and a sentencing hearing followed.

Facts of Offence

11An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered on sentence from which the following facts are drawn.

12The victim, Matthew Wallace (aged 46 years), resided with his partner and her family at Tahmoor. Shaun Brown (aged 22 years) and his father resided in an adjacent property.

13On 16 November 2009, a heated argument developed between the Browns and Mr Wallace concerning members of Mr Wallace's family playing loud music and having late parties.

14On 18 November 2009, the Applicant (aged 32 years) visited the Browns. The Applicant was a friend of Shaun Brown. At about 4.00 pm that day, an argument developed between the Applicant and Mr Wallace. Prior to this, the two men did not know each other. The argument turned violent and a physical fight developed between the two men on the street. During the fight, the Applicant stabbed Mr Wallace a number of times with a broken beer bottle, thereby wounding Mr Wallace.

15There was conflicting evidence concerning the circumstances leading up to the fight and what happened during the fight itself. The versions of Mr Wallace and the Applicant were recounted in the Agreed Statement of Facts, together with the accounts of other witnesses to the incident. The Agreed Statement of Facts identified the basis of the Applicant's plea as follows:

""Given the conflicting nature of the evidence, the Crown concedes it cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the fight was initiated by the offender. It is agreed that the offender is to be sentenced on the following basis:

- The offender and Mr Wallace both voluntarily engaged in a physical fight with each other on [xxx] St, Tahmoor following a verbal argument.

- There was violence on both sides.

-During the fight, the offender came to be in possession of a broken bottle, which he used to stab Mr Wallace in the right posterior and anterior chest area no more than five times thereby wounding him.

- This was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as the offender perceived them.

- During the fight Mr Wallace bit [the] offender in the right chest area.

- During the fight, both Mr Wallace and the offender sustained the injuries described in this document.""

16The Agreed Statement of Facts revealed that Mr Wallace was treated at Campbelltown Hospital following the incident. It was observed that Mr Wallace had abrasions on both knees, a one centimetre linear superficial wound on the left elbow, a two centimetre superficial wound on the posterior right shoulder, three superficial linear wounds on the right anterior chest (the longest being eight centimetres) and three angled wounds two-to-three centimetres long into fatty tissue in the right posterior chest. All wounds were cleaned and the posterior chest wounds were sutured.

17The Applicant was also taken to Campbelltown Hospital and treated. He sustained a round red mark (consistent with a bite mark) about five centimetres in diameter on the right chest above the right nipple, a laceration to the back of his left hand, a laceration behind his right shoulder and abrasions to his right elbow and right knee. 

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

18The Applicant was born in July 1977. He was 32 years' old at the time of the offence and 33 years at the time of sentence.

19The Applicant has a significant criminal history, commencing in 1996. His record contains entries for offences of dishonesty including break, enter and steal (in 1996 and 2003) and larceny (in 2003). Of greater relevance to the present case was his record for offences of violence against persons and property. It may be taken, as the Applicant's counsel conceded in this Court, that this record played a part in the Crown decision to prosecute the Applicant on indictment in this case. The Applicant's criminal history for offences of violence (and associated offences) was as follows:

20A presentence report and other material before the District Court indicated that the Applicant was the third of six children. He had been in a number of relationships and there was a 10-year old daughter from one of those relationships. The Applicant had been employed as an apprentice mechanic for a period prior to sentence.

The Course of the Sentencing Hearing in the District Court

21Because of the second ground of appeal, it is appropriate to recount the course of the sentencing hearing between 2 December 2010 and 11 March 2011.

22The Applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing on 2 December 2010 and a number of documents were tendered. Counsel for the Applicant made submissions on penalty, culminating in the submission that assessment of the Applicant for an ICO was appropriate. 

23Submissions were directed to s.7 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides that an ICO is not available if a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more was imposed. The Applicant's counsel sought an adjournment for an assessment as to suitability of the Applicant for an ICO. The Crown representative submitted that the offence was objectively serious and that the Applicant would not be eligible for an ICO (T20.18, 2 December 2010):

""It would be the prosecution's submission that the offender would not, in realistic terms, not be eligible because to be eligible, firstly, there would need to be a sentence of imprisonment of two years or less. It is the prosecution's submission that the court would not be considering such a sentence and the prosecution simply submits that because of the objective seriousness that it would fall above that two year period.""

24I pause to observe that no submission was made for the Applicant at the sentencing hearing that the theoretical possibility of the s.35(4) charge being disposed of summarily was a relevant factor on sentence.

25Her Honour Judge Syme proceeded to deliver remarks on sentence, culminating in the following statement (ROS10):

""Taking all of those features into account, in my view, and allowing the appropriate discount for a plea, in my view, a sentence of less than two years will be considered. Mr Zreika is a person who has had his ups and downs. He is clearly a person who can be assisted notwithstanding his previous patchy response to supervision and I propose to adjourn the matter for an Intensive Corrections Order assessment.""

26The sentencing proceedings were adjourned to 4 February 2011 for that purpose. On that day, two ICO assessments dated 3 and 4 February 2011 were presented and further evidence and submissions were received. The ICO report dated 3 February 2011 assessed the Applicant as being suitable for an ICO. However, an update assessment report dated 4 February 2011, stated that further information had been provided which confirmed a change in the Applicant's circumstances. The additional information was that the Applicant's co-resident (his girlfriend's mother) had contacted the relevant officer and advised that she was no longer prepared to have the Applicant nominate her address as his place of residence whilst subject to an ICO. 

27Accordingly, the Applicant was assessed as unsuitable for an ICO due to the withdrawal of consent concerning residence. The report stated that, should the Applicant nominate a new residential address, a further assessment would be required with an adjournment being necessary for that purpose. Evidence was given by the Applicant and Mr Adam Ferre on 4 February 2011. In light of the evidence adduced, the sentencing Judge determined to adjourn the proceedings for a further ICO assessment to be undertaken. The proceedings were adjourned until 11 March 2011 for this purpose.

28On 11 March 2011, an updated ICO assessment report dated 2 March 2011 was furnished to the Court. The report stated that, on 21 February 2011, the Applicant had advised the Service that he no longer wished to have the nominated address at Moorebank assessed for suitability for his residence and a further assessment was made of the Applicant's parents' residence at Claymore, previously assessed as unsuitable. The report stated that, based on current information, the Claymore address was now considered a suitable place for the Applicant to reside if sentenced to an ICO. It was noted, however, that the Applicant had advised that he anticipated relocating to Housing NSW accommodation in the Liverpool area within the near future and that he had been made aware that, if he was subject to an ICO, he would not be permitted to change residence until all necessary checks had been undertaken.

29The report stated:

""The offender has been assessed as suitable for an Intensive Correction Order. However, given Mr Zreika's extensive history of violent offending and his previous poor response to supervision, this Service has serious concerns as to his ability to successfully complete any Community based sentencing option."" 

30The sentencing Judge heard submissions as to the appropriate course to take in light of the ICO assessment. Her Honour raised with counsel during submissions, concerns about the Applicant's lack of stability in the context of his past record and the changing accommodation arrangements and counsel addressed on those issues (T2-4, 11 March 2011). 

31Her Honour proceeded with remarks on sentence, culminating in the imposition of the sentence referred to earlier in this judgment. The sentencing Judge referred to the history of the matter since 2 December 2010, including the updated ICO assessments. Her Honour then said (ROS3-4, 11 March 2011) (emphasis added):

""Mr Zreika has been made aware that if subject to an ICO he will not be permitted to change residences until all necessary checks have been made. In a period of about three months, a third residence proposed is while Mr Zreika may have resolved his drug issues he is certainly not leading a stable lifestyle and in my view is not a good risk nor a good candidate for an intensive corrections order. An intensive corrections order if it is made is an imprisonment sentence. If Mr Zreika fails in any part of that supervision then the term of that sentence or the balance of it must be served in full time custody. In my view I would not only perhaps be setting Mr Zreika up for failure if I made such an order, I would more importantly be making an order that I have absolutely no confidence he is going to be able to comply with. I do note that Mr Zreika advised the court that his serious offence was not committed unde [sic] the influence of any substances and I take that into account. It was committed, however, well after he resolved his drug issues. He has, as is evidenced by this offence and the other assessments, a real problem with what is often very politely termed 'anger management'. Mr Zreika has a real problem in maintaining his rage, he has a real problem in not causing serious injury to other people when he is aroused, as he believes, by somebody provoking him.

When assessing the length of the sentence that I propose to make today, I have already taken into account the mitigating circumstances as I found them to be, such as provocation. I do note also a further complication and further evidence that Mr Zreika does not have a stable lifestyle at the moment is his lack of employment. I am told that that is not due to any action on his part.

Notwithstanding the fact that Mr Zreika has been found suitable for an ICO I am not bound by such an assessment. For the reasons I have given I do not propose to make such an order. Instead I will make the order that I had considered making in the first place and that is an order for full-time custody.""

32Her Honour imposed the sentence under challenge which was backdated 22 days to take into account the Applicant's presentence custody. A finding of special circumstances was made by reference to the Applicant's ""demonstrated rehabilitation so far"" and his ""need for further assistance in relation to rehabilitation"". 
 
Ground 1 - The Standard Non-Parole Period Ground

33At the time of the Applicant's sentencing in March 2011, the relevant law concerning standard non-parole period offences was to be found in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. Submissions were made to the sentencing Judge concerning an assessment of the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offence. Her Honour concluded (ROS9-10, 2 December 2010):

""This is an offence that has a standard non-parole period. I acknowledge that a standard non-parole period, and in this case it is three years, which is substantial, is not a starting point. A standard non-parole period is a reference point for a mid-range offence that goes to trial. It is a useful guidepost.

When considering how a standard non-parole period should affect a sentencing procedure, a Judge must ask and answer the following questions: Are there reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period, and that question will be answered by considering, firstly, the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to the commission of the offence, including those which may explain why it was committed so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls within an offence of mid-range seriousness of an offence for the relevant kind. The Court must also consider the circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation which are present in this case, and which apply to the particular offender.

In this case, I categorise the offence as serious although, in my view, it is of less than mid-range seriousness but above, the bottom third of mid-range seriousness, that it is above one-third of seriousness for this offence but below mid-range seriousness. I have taken into account and considered the submissions of counsel. However, considering the number of wounds imposed, the level of injuries to the victim, and the lack of any other aggravating circumstances, as I have already referred to, this is not a matter that, in my view, reaches mid-range seriousness level. It is, however, an offence which considering the objective seriousness of it, requires a custodial sentence to be imposed both to reflect the harm to the victim, and to the community, and by way of specific and general deterrence.""
 
Submissions of Parties

34Mr Barrow, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the sentencing Judge had erred in the approach to sentence in light of the subsequent decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 85 ALJR 1154. He submitted that her Honour's approach infringed the statement in Muldrock v The Queen at 1163 [28].

35The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge's approach did not infringe the principles expressed in Muldrock v The Queen but that, in any event, the conclusions with respect to the objective seriousness of the offence were open, as was the sentence imposed for the offence.

Decision

36Since the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen on 5 October 2011, this Court has been called upon to consider that judgment and its practical application in sentence appeals. Sentencing Judges are being called upon to undertake a similar task at first instance in determining an appropriate sentence. Decisions in this Court include Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240, MDZ v R [2011] NSWCCA 243, Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254, Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259, Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 and R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288. First-instance sentencing decisions in the Supreme Court include those in R v Biddle [2011] NSWSC 1262 and R v Tran [2011] NSWSC 1480. 

37The challenge for sentencing Judges and this Court in applying the High Court's judgment in Muldrock v The Queen is partly explained by an unusual feature of the litigation in that case.

38As the judgment in Muldrock v The Queen indicates (at 1161, footnote 37), an application for special leave to appeal from the decision in R v Way was refused by the High Court in 2005. Thereafter, R v Way was applied repeatedly by the Courts in this State. It was never submitted by the Crown, or on behalf of an offender, that this Court should reconsider the decision in R v Way. 

39Indeed, the Crown appeal in R v Muldrock [2010] NSWCCA 106 was argued and determined by a three-judge Court, without any submission being made or suggested that the decision in R v Way should not be followed in any respect. Had it been indicated by one of the parties that this Court should depart from its decision in R v Way in any respect, given the importance and wide-spread application of that decision, it may have been expected that the Chief Justice would assemble a five-judge Bench to re-examine the earlier decision in accordance with the principles in R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 380-381.

40An examination of the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen reveals that the Crown advanced a submission, not made before the Court of Criminal Appeal, that R v Way was wrongly decided in one respect, with the High Court accepting that submission (at 1162 [24]-[25]). Self-evidently, the High Court did not have the advantage of a considered decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal where these matters had been ventilated, nor did the High Court have the assistance of a party making submissions supportive of the decision in R v Way. In effect, there was no contradictor on this issue.

41As a result of this course of events, State Courts have been called upon to construe the judgment of the High Court in circumstances where the High Court did not have the benefit, in the first instance, of a considered decision of this Court dealing with the same issues. 

42It is the duty of State Courts to apply the High Court's decision. However, that task is complicated by the unusual course of events, including the approach of the Crown adopted for the first time before the High Court of Australia.

43I return to the present case. It is necessary to read fairly the entirety of the sentencing Judge's remarks on the standard non-parole period issue (at [33] above). The sentencing Judge used the standard non-parole period as a ""reference point"" and a ""useful guide"", and not as a ""starting point"". This is entirely consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen.

44That part of her Honour's remarks on sentence which posed a series of questions for consideration involves a more problematic analysis. The statement that a sentencing Court must ask ""are there reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period"" does not comply with principle. However, her Honour further explained her approach. 

45The High Court did not suggest that a conventional assessment of objective offending, according to a scale of seriousness, was to be avoided: R v Koloamatangi at [18]-[19].

46The process of instinctive synthesis to be undertaken by a sentencing court involves the sentencing judge identifying all the factors that are relevant to the sentence and then making a value judgment as to is the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 377-378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen at 1162 [26]. Assessment of the objective gravity of an offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]. It is an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis, a purpose of which is the imposition of a proportionate sentence, which adequately punishes an offender: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

47The judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen has left somewhat opaque the meaning of the term ""objective seriousness"": R v Koloamatangi at [19]-[21]. Nevertheless, as subsequent decisions of this Court have stated, it remains part of a sentencing Judge's function to consider the objective gravity of the subject crime and the moral culpability of the offender: Ayshow v R at [39]; Sheen v R at [169]. Her Honour's remarks on sentence perform this function, albeit using different language. 

48I am not persuaded that the sentencing Judge misused the standard non-parole period in passing sentence on the Applicant. Nor am I satisfied that error is demonstrated in her Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the Applicant's offence. Accordingly, I would reject the first ground of appeal.

49However, even if there was substance in the first ground in a technical way, I would be entirely unpersuaded that some lesser sentence is warranted for the purposes of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Ground 2 - Asserted Error in the Decision Not to Impose an ICO

Submissions of Parties

50Mr Barrow accepted that the sentencing Judge was not bound to impose an ICO after requesting an assessment for the suitability of the Applicant for such a sentence. He acknowledged that the sentencing Judge exercised a discretion in this respect, and that it was necessary for him to demonstrate error in accordance with the principles in House v The King (1936) HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.

51Mr Barrow submitted that the second ground of appeal should be understood as a submission that the sentencing Judge took into account a mistaken understanding of the ICO system in the observation (in the passage extracted at [31] above) that if the Applicant ""fails in any part of that supervision then the term of that sentence or the balance of it must be served in full-time custody"" and that the imposition of an ICO would ""perhaps be setting Mr Zreika for failure if I made such an order"" (ROS3, 11 March 2011).

52Mr Barrow pointed to provisions within the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 which indicated that a sentence of full-time imprisonment was not an inevitable result of non-compliance with an ICO. Mr Barrow submitted that the sentencing Judge's lack of confidence in the Applicant seemed to flow largely from changes in his accommodation arrangements and that, if her Honour had had a complete understanding of how an ICO is administered, she may have been prepared to make the order and to give the Applicant the opportunity to avoid a full-time sentence of imprisonment. 

53Mr Barrow submitted that the sentencing Judge's concern that she was setting the Applicant up to fail, did not take into account the flexibility available to the Commissioner for Corrective Services and the Parole Authority in dealing with breaches of an ICO, should they occur.

54The Crown submitted that it was for the Applicant to demonstrate that he was a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of an ICO, and that the expression of concern in the final ICO assessment report weighed heavily against the use of that sentencing option. It was submitted that it was open to the sentencing Court, in the exercise of discretion, to decline to order that the sentence be served by way of an ICO.

Decision

55The power of a sentencing court to sentence an offender to an ICO was introduced by the Crimes (Sentencing Legislation) Amendment (Intensive Correction Orders) Act 2010, which commenced on 1 October 2010. The power of sentencing courts to order imprisonment by way of periodic detention ceased upon the commencement of this Act.

56An ICO is a custodial sentence: s.7 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is only available as a sentencing option if a court has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than two years. In this case, the sentencing Judge heard submissions on the threshold question of whether a sentence of more than two years ought be imposed, and concluded that ""a sentence of less than two years will be considered"" (ROS10, 2 December 2010). In determining that a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed and that a sentence of less than two years' imprisonment would be considered, the sentencing Judge complied with the principles expressed in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26], R v Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at 165-166 [70]-[72] and R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 at [76]-[84].

57Accordingly, the sentencing Judge adjourned the proceedings to allow an assessment of the Applicant as to his suitability for an ICO. 

58Sections 64-73A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 lay down sentencing procedures for ICOs. An ICO may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied of certain matters set out in s.67 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 67(3) provides that a court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make an ICO despite the contents of the assessment report. The sentencing court is required to have regard to the contents of the assessment report prepared with respect to the offender: ss.65, 67(2)(a) and 70 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

59Accordingly, a sentencing court is not bound to accept the assessment of suitability contained in the assessment report, although reasons should be given if the Court declines to make an ICO, in the face of an assessment report that states that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of an ICO in the community: s.67(5)

60The sentencing Judge in this case had regard to the assessment reports prepared with respect to the Applicant. The proceedings were adjourned initially to 4 February 2011, and then to 11 March 2011 for the purpose of updated assessment reports being prepared. 

61Clause 14(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010 provides that an ICO assessment report must take into account a number of specified matters, including any criminal record of the offender, the likelihood that the offender will re-offend, any risks associated with managing the offender in the community, the likelihood that the offender will commit a domestic violence offence and whether the offender will have suitable residential accommodation for the duration of an ICO. It is clear that the assessment reports concerning the Applicant in this case addressed these statutory criteria, together with other issues pertinent to his suitability for an ICO. 

62Breaches of an ICO are dealt with by the Commissioner of Corrective Services and the Parole Authority under ss.88-91 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. If the Commissioner of Corrective Services is satisfied that an offender has breached an ICO, the Commissioner can decide to impose a sanction on the offender under s.89, or can decide to take no action in respect of the breach: s.89(1). The sanctions available to the Commissioner are a formal warning or a more stringent application of the conditions of the ICO in accordance with the terms of those conditions: s.89(2). As an alternative to or in addition to imposing a sanction on the offender, the Commissioner can decide to refer the breach to the Parole Authority because of the serious nature of the breach: s.89(3). 

63The Parole Authority may, on its own motion or on the application of the Commissioner, deal with an offender's breach of an ICO by imposing any sanction that the Commissioner could impose under s.89, or by imposing a period of up to seven days' home detention on the offender as a condition of the offender's ICO or by revoking the ICO: s.90 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. 

64Accordingly, her Honour's observation that any breach of the ICO would lead to the sentence (or its balance) being served in full-time custody, did involve a legal misunderstanding of the powers and options available in the event of a breach of such an order. In fairness to the sentencing Judge, it should be noted that the legal representatives appearing in the District Court did not make any submission bearing upon the consequence of a breach of an ICO, then a comparatively new sentencing option. 

65In considering this ground of appeal, it is necessary to fairly read all relevant parts of the final updated assessment report before her Honour, together with all relevant parts of her Honour's remarks on sentence. The assessment report referred to problems relating to the Applicant's accommodation (and his change in accommodation). However, the assessment report assessed the Applicant as being suitable for an ICO, but then proceeded immediately to express serious concerns as to the Applicant's ability to successfully complete any community-based sentencing option. There is some tension between these two propositions.

66In the context of an offender who was being sentenced for an offence of violence, and who had a significant history of offences of violence, this aspect of the assessment was pertinent. Although her Honour was prepared to consider an ICO as an option, by 11 March 2011, there were aspects of the Applicant's circumstances which indicated that this option may not be appropriate. It must be kept in mind that an ICO may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied, amongst other things, that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of an ICO in the community, and that it is appropriate in all the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of ICO in the community: s.67(1)(b) and (c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. An ICO was not to be imposed unless the sentencing court was positively satisfied of these matters in circumstances where, in effect, the onus lay upon the Applicant to satisfy these requirements. 

67The assessment report expressed serious concerns as to the ability of the Applicant to successfully complete any community-based sentencing option. A fair reading of her Honour's remarks on sentence suggests that her Honour foreshadowed the distinct prospect of a complete breakdown in the Applicant's response to a community sentencing option. Although it was not technically legally correct to indicate that such a position would lead inevitably to full-time imprisonment (given the discretions available to the Commissioner of Corrective Services and the Parole Authority), the realistic position was that a complete breakdown in the Applicant's response to the order (and not a minor or technical breach) would likely see him serving the sentence of imprisonment which had been imposed but allowed to be served by way of an ICO.

68In the circumstances of this case, a passing error of this type is not material. It should not be concluded that the error may have infected the sentencing Judge's reasoning so that, without the error, some other and lesser sentence may have been imposed: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284; s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

69The second ground of appeal ought be rejected.

Ground 3 - Alleged Error in Failing to Take Into Account Theoretical Capacity of Offence to be Dealt With in the Local Court

Submissions of Parties

70Mr Barrow submitted that the Applicant had been committed for trial on a more serious charge (under s.35(2)), but pleaded guilty ultimately and was sentenced for the less serious offence under s.35(4) Crimes Act 1900. 

71Mr Barrow noted that all offences under s.35 are capable of summary disposal and, in that event, the jurisdictional limit in the Local Court was two years' imprisonment. He acknowledged that the Applicant had a significant criminal history, and that the decision of the prosecution to elect to proceed in the District Court on the s.35(2) offence was likely to have been influenced by the criminal history. 

72He submitted, however, that offences under s.35(2) are more commonly dealt with on indictment, with a lesser proportion of s.35(4) offences being dealt with in that way. Reference was made to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics, which pointed to the numbers of matters dealt with in the District Court or the Local Court for these two offences.

73Although acknowledging that no submission had been made in the District Court inviting the sentencing Judge to take into account on sentence the possibility of summary disposal of the s.35(4) offence, it was submitted that this was a factor which should have been taken into account and which should have resulted in some mitigation of penalty. In circumstances where the sentencing Judge made no mention of this factor, Mr Barrow submitted that error had been demonstrated. 

74The Crown submitted that the circumstances of the Applicant's offence and his criminal history for offences of violence were such that the matter was appropriately being dealt with in the District Court. In any event, the Crown submitted that the sentence actually imposed was less than the jurisdictional limit available to the Local Court if the matter had been dealt with summarily.

Sentence Grounds of Appeal Where the Point Was Not Taken Below

75Judges sitting in this Court have noted that grounds of appeal of this type are regularly and increasingly arising for consideration. The principle relied upon is a common law principle, and not one identified in s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

76Very frequently, the ground is relied upon in this Court, although no submission was made in the District Court that the possibility of summary disposal was a matter which ought be taken into account in mitigation of penalty. In such cases, of course, the sentencing Judge does not have the benefit of considered submissions from the parties, including a submission from the Crown as to why the relevant charge or charges came to be prosecuted on indictment in the District Court. 

77The submission advanced frequently on appeal (as in the present case) is that the sentencing Judge failed to have regard to what is said to have been a relevant factor, in circumstances where the Judge had not been invited to have regard to that factor in the first place at the sentencing hearing. 

78This Court has held that a failure by a sentencing Judge to mention that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court cannot of itself constitute error: R v Jammeh [2004] NSWCCA 327 at [28] (Buddin J, Wood CJ at CL and Shaw J agreeing); R v Pickett [2004] NSWCCA 389 at [32] (Buddin J, McColl JA and Howie J agreeing).

79This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. If material error is demonstrated, before the Court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721 [79]. It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15].

80There is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [49]. It might be thought that defence counsel would have ample opportunity to consider whether an argument concerning possible summary disposal should be made in the District Court, given that the acceptance of a plea of guilty to a lesser charge usually follows charge negotiations, as occurred in this case. The fact that a less serious charge is to proceed (and its consequences) would be at the forefront of counsel's thinking.

81The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].

82In rare circumstances, a factor which may operate in mitigation of penalty (and which appears clearly from the material before the sentencing Judge) may have been overlooked by defence counsel and the sentencing Judge. In such a case, this Court may be invited to have regard to it, often in circumstances where the Crown will accept that the relevant material raised a factor which should unequivocally operate in the offender's favour on sentence. As Warren CJ said in Bayram v R at [29], it may ""render a serious injustice"" if an offender was not able to correct the error in such a case. This approach reflects the primacy of the rule that appeal grounds should relate to arguments put, and decisions made, at first instance. At the same time, criminal appellate courts should be able to correct a miscarriage of justice, or serious injustice, in the clear and rare cases where the relevant matter has not been relied upon at first instance.

83It is difficult to see how the possibility of summary disposal lies in this category. In reality, as will be seen, the possibility of summary disposal as a mitigating factor is to be confined to a rare and exceptional set of circumstances where the offender is being sentenced in the District Court for an offence which may be seen as a clear summary offence which ought otherwise have been prosecuted in the Local Court. In such circumstances, it might be thought that the argument is so obvious that defence counsel at first instance will advance a submission in the District Court to that effect. If that does not occur, then this may be a very practical barometer as to whether such an argument was realistically available in the circumstances of the case in the first place.

Statutory Provisions Permitting Prosecution of Local Court Offences onIndictment

84With these preliminary remarks, it is appropriate to refer to statutory provisions which may see offences, ordinarily prosecuted as summary offences in the Local Court, being prosecuted on indictment. 

85Generally speaking, there is a hierarchy of criminal offences in this State:

(a)offences which may be prosecuted solely on indictment in the Supreme or District Courts;

(b)offences which may be prosecuted on indictment, or summarily in the Local Court, depending upon certain factors;

(c)offences which may be prosecuted solely as summary offences in the Local Court (putting to one side, for present purposes, summary offences which may be prosecuted in the Supreme or District Courts, the Land and Environment Court and the Industrial Relations Court).

86There are statutory mechanisms for a pure summary offence to be dealt with by the Supreme or District Courts, where the summary offence is related to an indictable offence which is before the higher Court or is a back-up offence: ss.165-169 Criminal Procedure Act 1986; Director of Public Prosecutions v Sinton [2001] NSWCA 179; 51 NSWLR 659 at 662 [9]ff; R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 36) [2008] NSWSC 626; 73 ATR 83 at 119 [215]-[217]; Huynh v R [2008] NSWCCA 216 at [67] - [72].

87Further, summary offences may be included on a Form 1 in the Supreme or District Courts: s.33(4)-(6) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

88Prior to the enactment of the scheme which introduced Table 1 and Table 2 offences, the mechanism for determining whether indictable offences ought be disposed of summarily before a Magistrate, or should proceed on indictment by way of trial or sentence, was to be found in s.476 Crimes Act 1900.

89The operation of s.476 was explained in Kant v Director of Public Prosecutions (1994) 34 NSWLR 216 at 219C-D, where Gleeson CJ (Clarke JA agreeing) said:

""S476 provided that specified offences, although indictable offences, could be tried summarily in certain circumstances where the defendant consented and the magistrate thought it proper. From the point of view of a defendant, one of the principal inducements to giving such consent was that the penalties available to be imposed by a magistrate following a summary hearing were significantly less than the maximum penalties following a trial before a jury. One of the matters that would ordinarily be relevant to a magistrate's decision as to whether it was proper to deal summarily with an offence, in circumstances where the defendant consented, was the appropriateness of the available penalties in such circumstances. If a defendant were willing to forego a right to trial by jury, and the magistrate were satisfied that, in the light of all relevant considerations, including the matter of penalty, it was an appropriate case for summary disposition, then the matter could be dealt with in that way.""

90The statutory scheme involving s.476 Crimes Act 1900 was abolished with the enactment, of the Criminal Procedure (Indictable Offences) Act 1995. That scheme, which introduced Table 1 and Table 2 offences, was considered by this Court in R v Bartalesi (1997) 41 NSWLR 641 and, more particularly, in R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317; 50 NSWLR 115.

91The statutory scheme since 1995 has removed from the discretionary determination of the Local Court, the decision as to whether an offence capable of being dealt with summarily or on indictment ought proceed in that way. The decision is vested, in different ways, in the parties to the criminal proceedings. 

92Indictable offences listed in Table 1 are to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor or the person charged with the offence concerned elects to have the offence dealt with on indictment: s.258(a) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Offences listed in Table 2 are to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor elects to have the offence concerned dealt with on indictment: s.258(b).

93All offences under s.35 Crimes Act 1900, including ss.35(2) and 35(4), are Table 1 offences: Clause 2, Schedule 1, Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

94If no election for indictable prosecution is made with respect to a Table 1 or Table 2 offence, the offence is to be dealt with summarily as if it were a summary offence: s.261. If an election is made for indictable prosecution, the offence is to be dealt with on indictment: s.262. 

95Section 263 provides for the time for making an election. That a charged person's criminal record is relevant to the process of election is reinforced by s.265 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which requires the prosecution to serve upon the person charged with a Table 1 offence, a copy of his or her criminal record.

96It might be thought that the provision of the criminal record to a person charged with a Table 1 offence is intended to assist that person to consider whether indictable election should be sought, and to be in a position to make submissions to the prosecution on the question whether the prosecution should elect for indictable disposal of the matter. 

97Section 267 makes provision for the maximum penalties available where Table 1 offences are dealt with summarily, and s.268 makes similar provision concerning Table 2 offences.

98The maximum term of imprisonment that the Local Court may impose for any offence under s.35 Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for two years: s.267(2). However, this provision prescribes the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court, and not the maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction: R v Doan at 123 [35]. 

99Magistrates must not regard the jurisdictional limit as some form of maximum sentence reserved for a worst case: Re Attorney General's Application Under Section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 2 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 515; 137 A Crim R 196 at 203-204; [27]; R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30].

100Paragraph 8 of the Prosecution Guidelines of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales lays down guidelines for election by the prosecution for an offence to be dealt with on indictment. The guidelines are furnished pursuant to s.13 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. Paragraph 8 of the Guidelines includes the following:
 

""... 

An election should not be made unless:

(i) the accused person's criminality (taking into account the objective seriousness and his or her subjective considerations) could not be adequately addressed within the sentencing limits of the Local Court; and/or

(ii) for some other reason, consistently with these guidelines, it is in the interests of justice that the matter not be dealt with summarily (eg. a comparable co-offender is to be dealt with on indictment; or the accused person also faces a strictly indictable charge to which the instant charge is not a back-up).

... .""

101The sentencing limits of the Local Court include the jurisdictional limit for the particular offence (ss.267-268 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) and the limitation on the imposition of consecutive sentences of imprisonment in the Local Court under s.58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

102In R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29, consideration was given to a ground of appeal of this type in the context of a Commonwealth prosecution. After reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v El Masri, and to the provisions of s.4J(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) with respect to summary disposal of federal indictable offences, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J, I said at 47 [84]-[86]:

""84An offence which, as a matter of jurisdiction, is capable of being disposed of summarily may be prosecuted on indictment in a number of circumstances:

(a)the offence may be one of a number of offences in relation to which the accused person is committed for trial but where the person is acquitted of, or the Crown does not proceed with, the more serious charge (see, for example, El Masri); 

(b)the offence may be one where the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the exercise of discretion, has determined that the matter ought to proceed on indictment: s.4J(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth); s.260(1) or (2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986;

(c)infrequently, the offence may be one where the offender resisted summary disposal and elected for prosecution on indictment: s.4J(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth); s.260(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

85The principles in Crombie and El Masri have particular application with respect to the first class of offences referred to in the preceding paragraph. In such a case, the offender may be in a position to contend, with some force, that he or she stands for sentence in the District Court with respect to an offence which otherwise would have been disposed of summarily in the Local Court. That is not this case.

86The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, in the present case, formed the view that this matter was appropriate to be prosecuted on indictment. That is a decision which lies within the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and in relation to which provision is made in paragraphs 5.9-5.11 of the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Similar provisions exist with respect to State offences in paragraph 8 of the Prosecution Guidelines of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW): R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 at paragraph 10. Decisions made in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion are not readily subjected to review or appellate scrutiny by the courts: Maxwell v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 501 at 512, 534; Hanna v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 134 at paragraphs 40ff. In R v Murray [2000] NSWCCA 159, Carruthers AJ (Hulme J agreeing) said at paragraph 16:

'It is a question of discretion for the Director of Public Prosecutions whether matters such as this be proceeded within the Local Court or the District Court, and it would only be in a rare matter, I would have thought, that this Court would be prepared to express a view as to whether it was or was not appropriate for the Director to have elected to proceed in the District Court in relation to certain matters as distinct from the Local Court.'

In my view, where the Director of Public Prosecutions has elected to prosecute a matter on indictment, it would require a very clear case of inappropriate prosecution of an offence on indictment before the Crombie and El Masri principles could provide an argument in mitigation resulting from a lost opportunity for summary disposal of that offence.""


103Circumstances in which a ground of appeal of this type will have real traction are best illustrated by R v El Masri. There, the applicant was committed for trial upon a charge of assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation. He stood trial upon that count, with an alternative count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was acquitted on the first count and pleaded guilty to the second count. The circumstances of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm involved a single punch to the side of the head of the victim, with relatively minor injury resulting. The applicant had no criminal record for offences of violence. This Court took the view that the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was, in truth, a summary offence which was only being dealt with in the District Court on indictment, because of the purely indictable count of which the Applicant was acquitted. It was entirely clear that the offence would otherwise have been dealt with summarily, but for the existence of the more serious charge.

104A further example of a clear case where the ground succeeded is McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; 194 A Crim R 439. There, the applicant was committed for trial on a charge of aggravated breaking and entering with intent under s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900. However, that charge was not proceeded with and the applicant pleaded guilty to common assault and malicious damage to property. In delivering judgment allowing the offender's appeal against sentence, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) said at 444 [22]-[23]:

""22The Crown eventually did not proceed on the first count. This is unsurprising having regard to the offence that was alleged. Therefore the two matters arising from the incident with his brother were before the District Court only because of the charge in the first count that was not ultimately pursued. Neither the offence of malicious damage or the assault warranted a committal to the District Court. In fact both offences must be dealt with in the Local Court (where the value of the property on the malicious damage charge does not exceed $5,000) unless election is made for trial on indictment: see s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act and the second schedule to that Act. The election would have been made in this case only because the first count had to be dealt with in the District Court. In these circumstances it is highly relevant that the offences could have, and should have in the normal course of events, been dealt with in the Local Court.

23The relevance of this fact is more than merely the sentencing limit to which a magistrate is generally restricted. That is the normal consideration given to the fact that an offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court; R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297. However, the maximum penalty for an assault under s 61, when dealt with summarily is relevantly, 12 months imprisonment: s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Here the Judge imposed a sentence of 9 months. Similarly for an offence of malicious damage where the value of the property does not exceed $5,000 the maximum penalty is 12 months. Here the Judge imposed a sentence of a fixed term of 19 months. There is no value stated of the damage but I cannot believe that it would be more than $5,000.""

105His Honour then referred to passages from R v El Masri and R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349, before concluding at 446 [26]:

""Although, unlike the situation in El Masri, the Judge in this case did indicate that the two offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court, there needed, in my opinion, to be a closer analysis of the situation because of the reduced maximum penalties that would apply, they being less than the normal jurisdictional limit in the Local Court of 2 years imprisonment. As her Honour noted, both these offences were to the lower end of the scale of seriousness. In my opinion the sentence for the malicious damage was excessive having regard to the nature of the offence and in light of the fact that it exceeded the sentence that the Local Court could lawfully have imposed had it been dealt with in that jurisdiction. The sentence for the assault was also manifestly excessive. The applicant should be re-sentenced for these two offences.""

106The position with those charges was contrasted with a further charge against Mr McCullough which was appropriately before the District Court. Howie J said at 446 [27]:

""This criticism cannot be applied to the Judge's consideration of the malicious wounding offence. It was clearly appropriate for that offence to be before the District Court, and the applicant's representative did not suggest otherwise. On its face the appropriate sentence for that offence given its seriousness was more than the magistrate could have imposed. Although the Judge did not refer to the fact that this offence could, at least notionally, have been dealt with in the Local Court, there was no error in failing to refer to that fact.""

107Very few cases before this Court display the exceptional circumstances which existed in R v El Masri and McCullough v R. The usual case before this Court, illustrated by the present case, involves a person who is committed for trial upon one or more indictable offences and pleads guilty, usually after charge negotiations, to a lesser indictable offence. A common feature is that the circumstances of the offence for which sentence was passed remain serious, and frequently the offender has a significant criminal history.

108These more common circumstances lead to an argument in this Court, which seeks to challenge the characterisation of the offence as one which was appropriate to be dealt with on indictment. This process leads inevitably to an examination of the circumstances of the offence and the criminal history of the offender. 

109Unless this Court is able to clearly determine that the offence in question, committed by the particular offender with his or her criminal history, ought to have remained in the Local Court, then the argument is theoretical at best. The bare theoretical possibility of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice: Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [31]; Edwards v R at [47]; McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305; 198 A Crim R 549 at 561-562 [62]-[67].

110Grounds of appeal, as asserted by the present Applicant, have been considered in a number of recent decisions of this Court, including Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177, Dagdanasar v R [2010] NSWCCA 310, Lewis v R [2011] NSWCCA 206, Kean v R [2011] NSWCCA 136 and LB v R [2011] NSWCCA 220. The frequency of appeals which raise this ground tends to emphasise the fact that the issue is well known as a potential factor to be taken into account on sentence, so that this Court should apply a rigorous approach in requiring offenders to take the point at first instance, before being permitted to raise it in this Court.

111The ground of appeal can only be meaningful if this Court determines that the total sentence for the particular offence should not have exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. It might be thought that a ground asserting manifest excess is capable of covering the same ground, if the position is that clear in the particular case.

112Unless it is plainly wrong that the offence is in the District Court, it is difficult to see how an offender can succeed on a ground of appeal which claims that a relevant factor has not been taken into account by the sentencing Judge.

113In support of the present appeal, the Applicant relied upon statements in Kean v R and, in particular, by Adams J (at [37]). I do not consider that anything said in that case assists the Applicant. 

114However, I wish to make some observations about that decision. It appears to be based upon an incomplete understanding of the statutory scheme described earlier in this judgment. 

115The history of the District Court proceedings against Mr. Kean may be traced in the decisions of his Honour Judge Berman SC, the most experienced Judge who tried and sentenced him: R v Kean [2009] NSWDC 435; R v Kean [2010] NSWDC 29. Mr. Kean was sentenced after trial for an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, and after pleading guilty to stealing a Mercedes Benz motor vehicle, and a further count of break, enter and steal, with an offence of take and drive conveyance being taken into account on a Form 1 on the last count.

116Mr. Kean had a very lengthy criminal history, involving some 30 prior burglary offences. He was on parole at the time of the aggravated break, enter and steal and on bail at the time of the break, enter and steal offence.

117No submission was advanced before the District Court that the theoretical possibility of summary disposal of some counts ought operate in the offender's favour on sentence: Kean v R at [34]. 

118Adams J observed at [34] that it ""is not clear why, apart from convenience, these counts [stealing the Mercedes Benz vehicle and the break enter and steal offence] were dealt with in the District Court"". His Honour continued, at [37], that it ""seems clear that, if the matter had come before the District Court as an administrative convenience, the fact that it could have been dealt with in the Local Court and, in the normal course, is a matter of significance"". (The catchwords for Kean v R include the words ""concurrent jurisdiction of the Local and District Courts - for convenience all matters heard in the District Court"").

119His Honour concluded (at [37]), that the fact that the matter was not raised by counsel, and not referred to by the sentencing Judge, indicated that ""it was overlooked"". Adams J proceeded to refer to the circumstances of the offence, and the offender's significant criminal history for offences of dishonesty, before concluding (at [40]) that ""were it not for the applicant's criminal record, it would in my view have been necessary, in respect of count 3 [stealing the Mercedes Benz vehicle] and the CAN offence [break enter and steal], to give significant weight to the fact that they could have been dealt with in the Local Court"". 

120With respect, it is erroneous to conclude that the two nominated offences were before the District Court as a matter of ""administrative convenience"". They were Table 1 offences and were before the District Court following an election for indictable disposal of the matters. The fact that the offender was a recidivist burglar (with some of his offences committed in breach of conditional liberty) was a likely explanation for an election for prosecution on indictment, in addition to the seriousness of the offences in question.

121In my view, the decision in Kean v R ought be understood as one confined to its own facts, and should not be regarded as a decision which assists the determination of other appeals.

The Present Case

122In the present case, the Applicant's offence was an appropriate crime to be prosecuted on indictment in the District Court. It is clear that the Crown took that view and advanced a submission in the District Court that a sentence of imprisonment for more than two years was appropriate on the s.35(4) offence. An examination of the circumstances of the offence, involving the use of a broken bottle to stab the victim five times, considered against the background of the Applicant's history of offences of violence, undermines entirely his argument that the sentencing Judge failed to have regard to a relevant factor on sentence in a manner which warrants the imposition of a lesser sentence.

123In any event, the sentence imposed in the District Court did not reach the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. It is difficult to see how this ground of appeal could work in the Applicant's favour in these circumstances, even if it was made out.

124In my view, no error has been demonstrated, let alone an error that would lead this Court to impose a lesser sentence. I would reject the third ground of appeal.

Conclusion

125I am not persuaded that the Applicant has made good any of his grounds of appeal. Even if error had been demonstrated, however, I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In truth, the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was a moderate one given the circumstances of the offence and his history of offending.

126I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

127ROTHMAN J: I have read the reasons for judgment of Johnson J and the orders his Honour proposes. I am indebted to him for his analysis. It is therefore not necessary for me to deal at all with the facts, nor with submissions of the parties. I wish, however, to make some comment on the issues.

Ground 1: Misuse of the standard non-parole period

128Ground 1 of the appeal must fail. In that regard, I agree with [48] of the reasons of Johnson J. It is necessary to make some further short comment.

129In particular, I do not agree that application of the reasons for judgment in Muldrock is ""complicated"" by the failure of the parties to submit to this Court that Way was wrongly decided. It is always, of course, better if all submissions are put at each level of the judicial hierarchy and failure to do so may be a basis, in appropriate cases, for refusal of leave or rejection of the grounds of appeal (see for example Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules).

130However, I do not agree that either the failure to rely upon the incorrectness of Way in this Court, or the concession as to the incorrectness of Way in the High Court, explains ""the challenge for sentencing judges and this Court in applying"" Muldrock. In my view, the reasons for judgment in Muldrock speak for themselves. I therefore do not associate myself with the comments of Johnson J at [37] to [42].

131As earlier stated, I agree that the sentencing judge has not disclosed error in accordance with the principles expressed in Muldrock, in the manner in which her Honour has dealt with the standard non-parole period.

Ground 2: error in the understanding of an ICO

132I agree with Johnson J at [55] to [63] and his analysis of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. I would add only that s 91 of that Act permits a judicial member of the Parole Authority, on application of the Commissioner of Corrective Services, to order the suspension of the ICO in urgent circumstances. The Parole Authority may revoke the ICO under s 90(1)(c) of the Act, pursuant to Division 1 of Part 7 thereof: s 163. Clearly, this remedy is for a breach in the worst category, or repeated breaches, particularly, given the other remedies available.

133I also agree with Johnson J at [64] that her Honour was in error when describing the effect of any breach: see [51] infra. It is unfortunate that her Honour was not assisted by the parties below with a proper analysis of the effect of a breach of an ICO. Nevertheless, as a consequence, her Honour's exercise of discretion miscarried.

134Her Honour declined to make an ICO in circumstances where her Honour misunderstood the effect of making such an order, or its implementation, if any breach were to occur. In other words, her Honour, with great respect, took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely, a legal consequence of breach that was otherwise than in accordance with the Act. Alternatively, her Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the operation of an ICO and the consequences of breach. Further, error of law is disclosed. Such an error is not immaterial.

135I agree with Johnson J at [68] that it should not be concluded that her Honour, if made aware of the correct effect of any breach of an ICO, would have decided differently, but no one but her Honour would know what, in those circumstances, she would have done.

136Further, it would seem that if this Court were contemplating an ICO it would be preferable for a current assessment to be available, particularly because s 67 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act makes suitability for such an order a precondition to its issue. 

137In those circumstances, and because I understand this judgment would then be issued in dissent, I would otherwise have allowed the appeal, set aside the sentence and remitted the matter to her Honour to deal with the sentence in accordance with law pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I note, however, that parole is to commence in two months and it is unlikely that such an order would provide the applicant with any advantage, and therefore would agree that no order giving effect to this ground be made.

Ground 3: Failure to take into account the possibility that Charge could have been dealt with in the Local Court

138I agree that this ground of appeal should fail. With respect to Johnson J, I agree with his analysis at [84] to [94]. I also agree with the conclusions and comments at [95] to [102]. Further, I would adopt and apply the comments of his Honour (with whom McClellan CJ and Adams J agreed) in R v Gent at [84] et seq, recited at [102] infra.

139It will be rare for this Court to grant an appeal based on a ground such as this. In R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251 at [42] to [43] (with the concurrence of Grove and Howie JJ) I said: 

""It was suggested to his Honour below that his Honour was entitled to take into account that the matter before him could have been taken in the Local Court and his Honour took that into account. ...

It is not absolutely clear how it was that his Honour took that into account. It is even less clear that it is even appropriate to take it into account at all. Unless it can be said that the election by the prosecuting authority was inappropriate or unreasonable, the matter is before the District Court and must be dealt with in accordance with the sentencing principles otherwise applicable.""

140The general approach was reiterated by me in Stanford v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 73 (McClellan CJ at CL and Hulme J agreeing) at [50] in which I said:

""A court may have regard on sentence, in a matter dealt with by the court on indictment, to the fact that the matter could have been dealt with by way of summary disposal: R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195. The obverse is also true; a court may choose, for good reason, not to have regard to that fact. In this instance the prosecuting authority chose to have the matter dealt with in the District Court. The exercise of that power was correct and cannot be the subject of criticism. So much is conceded by the applicant. The criminality of the offence in question was too serious to be dealt with by the Local Court. In those circumstances, the sentencing judge is required to deal with the matter in accordance with ordinary principle. The sentencing judge is required to have regard to any standard non-parole period, the maximum sentence that may be imposed and the general principles applicable either under the common law or statute to the fixing of the sentence. The jurisdictional limit for a sentence, if the matter were to have been processed in the Local Court, is not a constraining element (or any element) in those circumstances: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [14]-[16]; R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29], [30]. This ground of appeal fails.""

141I do not understand anything said by Adams J in Kean v R as inconsistent with the foregoing. Adams J does not, in fact, find that the charges were dealt with in the District Court as a matter of ""administrative convenience"". His Honour expressed the view that it was not clear why the counts were dealt with in the District Court and commented on the approach to be taken ""if the matter"" were dealt in that way for that reason. Unfortunately, as pointed out by Johnson J, the ""catchwords"" of the published reasons seem to refer to such a finding. I agree with Johnson J that ""administrative convenience"", simpliciter, is not a valid basis for a charge to be dealt with on indictment, which can be effected only on one of the bases prescribed by the statute.

142This factor (namely, that the charge could have been dealt with summarily) is not a mandatory consideration in sentencing. It may, from time to time, be relevant. Non-consideration of the factor may in some case be an error of principle, but that will occur rarely. I do not need otherwise to restrain or restrict the matters to which a sentencing judge may have regard, nor comment on whether ""exceptional circumstances"" are necessary for an appeal to succeed on this ground. In this case, the ground must fail.

2708432,Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23,"Judgment 

1Whealy JA : I agree with Davies J. 

2Rothman J: I agree with Davies J. 

3Davies J : On 1 December 2008 the Applicant pleaded guilty to maliciously wounding David Deakin with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Two other offences of malicious wounding in company were to be taken into account on a Form 1. 

4On 24 July 2009 the Applicant was sentenced by Judge Freeman in the District Court to a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months commencing 13 September 2007 and expiring on 12 March 2013 with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 12 March 2016. At the same time his Honour sentenced the Applicant's co-offender Darren Simpson. 

The facts 

5The offences arise out of assaults committed by the Applicant and Simpson on three persons being David Deakin, Oliver Ashworth and Neal Ashworth on 20 July 2007. His Honour found the facts of the matter as follows: 

a. About 2.35 am on Friday 20 July 2007 David Deacon (sic), Oliver Ashworth and Neil Ashworth were walking with another friend in a northerly direction along Pitt Street near Martin Place in the Sydney CBD. 

b. At the same time Shawn Butler, Paul Helmrich and two women were walking south on Pitt Street. This group passed the victims without incident. 

c. The offender Simpson and Melanie Collins were proceeding south on Pitt Street about fifteen metres behind Butler and the others. As Simpson came abreast of the victims he shoulder charged one and began throwing punches. He was repeatedly claiming to be a policeman and thus having the right to do whatever he wanted. 

d. Oliver Ashworth and David Deacon tried to separate Simpson from Neil Ashworth. Melanie Collins yelled ""Shawn"" to attract the attention of the offender Butler who turned and ran back towards the victims, one of whom, he says, had Simpson in a headlock. 

e. At some stage before he reached the group of victims and Simpson, Butler fitted to his right forefinger what he described as a locksmith's tool. This was a small flat piece of metal shaped into two short prongs at the end but with both sides of the device sharpened. He positioned it in the manner of a signet ring with the points standing a little over two centimetres proud of his right hand. 

f. The Crown submits that the two offenders had reached an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them to strike and injure the victims. I find this must be so. The pleas support this. But it should be said that no agreement could have been reached any earlier. Butler had passed without any interference with the victims and the incident would not have occurred nor been contemplated but for the actions of Simpson. Thereafter there was a melee which was lasted no more than three minutes. 

g. The victim David Deacon described the assault upon him in this fashion: 

They both came towards me. I saw Butler doing something with his left hand, moving his fingers about and lifting his left arm up. Simpson was looking very angry. I backed off and put my hands up and said 'I don't want a fight, fuck off'. I recall saying this three or four times. Simpson ran straight at me and crash tackled me. I hit a car, I think it was red. Simpson had me pinned up against the car. I felt my arms down by my side and he had me in a bear hug, I couldn't move. Butler came at me and swung at me with his left hand and got the right hand side of my face. The right hand of my face hit the bonnet of the car. I closed my eyes and he really hit me for a six. Within a second I felt another blow to the left hand side of face when I was on the bonnet, it was a really heavy hit. I stood up and felt blood spraying and gushing about 6 feet away out of my lip area on the right hand side. I also felt the left hand side of my face bleeding. I put my hand over my lip where the blood was spraying out everywhere. 

h. The wound to the right side of David Deacon's face was a laceration which extended from below the right ear across the face and through the bottom lip. The wound to the left cheek of David Deacon went through to the bone and extended from the left ear to the chin, cutting a number of arteries. The facial artery was severed in a number of places and he lost about one and a half litres of blood at the scene. Mr Deacon is left with significant facial scarring and he said, in his victim impact statement, that he was reminded almost every day by people questioning him about the origins of those scars. He detailed, as one might expect, his initial shock, his continuing fear or at least nervousness whenever he goes out, and his ongoing bewilderment as to the reasons for such savagery. 

i. The second victim, namely Neil Ashworth, pulled Butler away from David Deacon. He said that 

""Butler turned and tried to get me. I moved back. I noticed he had these little shiny things in his hands. This guy hit me between my ear and my crown. I did not realise at the time he had cut me, it felt like a punch at first."" 

j. The blow delivered by the offender Butler caused a 6 centimetres wound which penetrated through the scalp to bone. During this assault Neil Ashworth also sustained a blackened left eye, lacerations on his neck and scratches and bruises on his body. In his victim impact statement Mr Neil Ashworth recounts his loss of confidence to defend himself in any awkward situation. He fears confrontation, he is excessively concerned for the safety of his brother and friends, and he tends to panic in the event of there being any mild confrontational situation. 

k. The remaining victim, Oliver Ashworth, was punched in the back of the head. He was knocked forward and dazed by the blow. He then described being struck by the offender Butler in this way: 

I felt a punch come up from my right into my left cheek bone. It was with a lot of force and it felt like a full force punch. I had hold of my motor scooter helmet in my right hand. I felt another blow to the left side of my head above my ear. This was a really heavy full force punch as well and again I did see what exactly it was that hit me. The blow did not knock me over but I was leaning over trying to protect myself as it was happening. 

l. He described how his next recollection was lying on the footpath holding his face because he felt as though his cheek bone had collapsed from the pain. There was a lot of blood. His brother and he were both holding onto his face to apply pressure to stem the bleeding. He sustained a three centimetre laceration to the left temple region that severed a small artery and a deep laceration to his left cheek which divided the intraorbital nerve. In his victim statement Mr Oliver Ashworth detailed the numbness across the left side of his face which continues and he is left with scars and the problem of pressure in his ears which means that he now suffers extreme pain through pressure change, such as being a passenger in a descending aircraft. This is a particular concern since his work requires him to fly interstate quite often. He recorded that the wound was so deep that the flesh had hewn to the bone requiring lengthy and extremely painful physiotherapy to regain some facial function. He, too, speaks of the extent to which his life has been changed by this assault, causing a loss of self confidence, generating an ongoing feeling of helplessness and an increased level of alertness whenever he is out. He, too, is reminded frequently of his facial scarring by questions and comments, and each time he says the mention of the scar takes him straight back to the incident and brings up foul memories. 

m. All of the victims were obviously at a loss to explain and consequently to understand the reason for them being set upon and seriously injured. 

n. The registered number of the car in which the offenders drove away was noted and the registered owner named Simpson as being the driver at that time. 

o. Simpson was arrested and charged on the afternoon of Friday 20 July 2007. He then took part in a recorded interview which was notable for the absence of information contained therein. He did not see any weapons, blood or injuries. He did not recall how the fight started. He provided false names for Butler and the man Helmrich and said that other people must have perpetrated the injuries upon the victims. He was charged and admitted to bail then rearrested on 23 July 2007. 

p. The Applicant went to New Zealand after the assaults, but he says that this was in ignorance of the outcome and that he was in fact there for the purpose of planning his impending wedding. He returned to Australia when he ascertained that the police were looking for him, and he surrendered himself to police on 13 September 2007. 


Extension of time 

6The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed only on 10 October 2011. A Notice of Application for extension of time was also filed on 10 October 2011. That Notice was supported by an affidavit from the Applicant's solicitor. The affidavit deposed to the fact that the Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 21 August 2009 but that the solicitor had not then been instructed by the Applicant. The Applicant had applied for Legal Aid but that was ultimately rejected on 24 June 2010. 

7The Applicant then sought to retain and brief private practitioners. This involved obtaining advice from Senior Counsel in relation to the appeal. 

8Whilst it does not appear to me that all of the delay has been adequately explained, the Crown does not oppose the extension of time for appeal. In the absence of any prejudice to the Crown, I consider that the extension of time should be granted. 

Grounds of appeal 

9When the appeal was first filed the first ground was as follows: 

1. The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to properly apply Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the standard non-parole period provisions) in sentencing the Applicant. 

Submissions in support of that ground were then prepared. 

10On 5 October 2011 the High Court delivered judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 85 ALJR 1154. That led, in due course, to that ground being abandoned and an application being made to rely on an alternative ground also out of time. 

11The grounds upon which the application was ultimately argued were these: 

2. The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he took into account the two offences on the Form 1. 

3. The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offence. 

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he took into account the two offences on the Form 1. 

12When referring to the matters on the Form 1 the Sentencing Judge said this: 

Butler's culpability is high. Moreover, after seriously injuring David Deacon he then prosecuted the attack on the Ashworth brothers. Whilst these assaults are to be taken into consideration on a Form 1, they do not thereby disappear. The fact that he attacked the other two, after doing such damage to David Deacon, increases his overall culpability and this should be reflected in a sentence more stern than would be applicable for the attack on a single victim. 

For that reason the extensive case review provided on his behalf is not a completely reliable guide. Those cases, in the main, referred to malicious wounding involving a single victim. 
13The Applicant submitted that by using the words ""increases his overall culpability"" the Judge was in error in according greater seriousness to the primary offence rather than simply using the Form 1 offences to increase the sentence. The Applicant points also to what his Honour said at the end of the quoted passage to suggest that his Honour regarded the primary offence more seriously by reason of the Form 1 offences. This was said to be evident from his Honour's contrast of cases of malicious wounding involving a single victim with the primary case. It was submitted that the primary offence properly involved only a single victim because the other injured persons were the subject of the Form 1 offences. 

14The manner in which offences on a Form 1 are to be taken into account was explained by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] as follows: 

The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 

15The Applicant pointed to the lack of precision in the Sentencing Judge's language to suggest that he was wrapping up the Form 1 offences with the primary offence rather than making a strict demarcation of a sentence for the primary offence and then adding weight to that sentence having regard to what was contained in the Form 1. 

16The Applicant further submitted that because the Sentencing Judge found the Applicant to have good prospects of rehabilitation the additional weight that could be given to personal deterrence was very limited. 

17In my opinion no error is demonstrated by reason of his Honour's remarks or the approach he took to the sentence based on the Form 1 offences. His Honour made it clear that the Form 1 offences should be reflected in a sentence more stern than would be applicable if only the primary offence was being considered. Similarly, in referring to the other cases his Honour was simply making the point that the sentences in those cases were for the commission of a single offence where no regard was required to be given to other offences, particularly other similar offences, on a Form 1. 

18There is no error in increasing the sentence because of the Form 1 offences. Simply because the Applicant was considered to have good prospects of rehabilitation, issues of personal deterrence were not removed from consideration, nor did it make the weight that could be accorded to personal deterrence very limited. 

19Moreover, in the present case, retribution was a relevant consideration where the Form 1 offences were serious offences even though they were committed in close proximity to the primary offence. They were, however, not a necessary part of the commission of the primary offence since each of the offences was committed consecutively (see Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272 per Hoeben J, with whom McClellan CJ in CL agreed at [63]-[66]; R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140). 

20This ground fails. 

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offence 

21The Sentencing Judge sentenced the Applicant before the High Court gave judgment in Muldrock . Somewhat presciently his Honour dealt with the standard non-parole period in this way. 

22First, he said: 

It is necessary to bear in mind, as well, the fact that Butler faces a charge for which the maximum sentence is twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of seven years is prescribed. I accept of course that on the authority of Way's case the application of the standard non-parole period is not automatic where there has been, as here, a plea of guilty. Nonetheless, the standard non-parole period remains as a guideline or yardstick. 

23Secondly, his Honour said nothing about the objective seriousness of the offence, nor did his Honour engage in the two stage process mandated by R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 but rejected in Muldrock at [28]. Of course, whether a court is now required or permitted to classify, or is prohibited from classifying, the particular offence by reference to low, middle or high range of objective seriousness remains in doubt: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [19]. The High Court did not suggest, however, that a conventional assessment of objective offending was to be avoided. 

24The basis of complaint in relation to this ground is that, because the Sentencing Judge did not have available to him the decision in Muldrock , the sentencing miscarried. In particular, the Applicant submitted that because the Sentencing Judge accepted the authority of Way's case his use of the standard non-parole period as a guideline or yardstick, in accordance with how Way's case approached standard non-parole periods, was an error. The Applicant submitted that the High Court's approach meant that it was a different guideline or yardstick to which regard should have been had. 

25The yardstick was said to have changed in two ways - first, because of the change in the approach to the assessment of objective circumstances in that they are now to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders but wholly by reference to the nature of the offending; and secondly, that the standard non-parole period was previously mandatory unless factors could be found to depart from it. The Applicant's submission was that where those matters had fundamentally changed any consideration of the standard non-parole period as a guideline or yardstick in accordance with Way's case must be infected with error. 

26In my opinion no error has been shown in relation to the way the Sentencing Judge approached the standard non-parole period. Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre- Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick. 

27In the present case the remarks of the Sentencing Judge suggest that little can be pointed to as constituting error. The Sentencing Judge referred both to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as two factors to be considered ( Muldrock at [27]), did not engage a two stage process to sentencing ( Muldrock at [28]), and did not point to any factors to justify any departure from the standard non-parole period even used only as a guideline or yardstick. To suggest that the words ""yardstick"" or ""guideline"" might now carry some different emphasis or meaning by reason of matters in Muldrock is to apply an overly analytical approach to the use of those terms. 
28Even if, as the Applicant submitted, those words now bear a different meaning as a result of the decision in Muldrock , they do so for two reasons irrelevant to the present case - first, because the Sentencing Judge did not make reference to objective circumstances and secondly, because he did not refer to the mandatory nature of a the standard non-parole period nor did he consider factors showing a need to depart from it. 

29This ground also fails. 

Section 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 

30Even if I had considered that the Sentencing Judge fell into error I do not consider that any other sentence than was imposed was warranted in law. The assault on the three victims was a particularly vicious one. A number of matters suggest that the sentence imposed by his Honour was entirely appropriate. 

31First, even if the Applicant initially believed that the co-offender Simpson was being attacked by the victims, Deakin said to the offenders, before the Applicant struck the first blow, that he (Deakin) did not want to fight. At the time the Applicant struck the first blow Simpson had Deakin pinned up against the car in a bear hug unable to move. 

32Secondly, the Applicant fitted to his right forefinger the locksmith's tool before he struck any of the victims. It was a sharp device which the Sentencing Judge found was clearly sufficiently serious to wound the victims, and did seriously wound them. 

33Thirdly, the Applicant, having struck Deakin on the right side of his face which caused blood to spray and gush out for some distance from his lip area on that side, then proceeded to strike him again on the left side of his face causing a serious laceration down to the bone cutting a number of arteries. This blow certainly involved the use of the locksmith's tool whilst the victim was being held by the co-offender. 

34Fourthly, when the second victim, Neal Ashworth, tried to pull the Applicant away from Deakin, the Applicant turned on Neal Ashworth and delivered a blow that caused a six centimetre wound that penetrated through the scalp to the bone. Then the Applicant attacked the third victim Oliver Ashworth by punching him in the back of the head, an action that suggests the blow was not struck in any form of self-defence. 

35The three victims have all sustained permanent scarring to their facial area. 

36Finally, these offences were committed only two days after the Applicant had been placed on a two year section 9 bond for common assault where it would appear drugs and alcohol had been involved. This is so, because one of the conditions of the bond signed by the Applicant was that he obey all reasonable directions for counselling, educational development or drug and alcohol rehabilitation of the Probation and Parole Service. In my opinion, the fact that there was a stay in relation to that bond by reason of an appeal lodged by the Applicant makes little difference. Although the Applicant was not on conditional liberty by reason of the stay of the bond, the Sentencing Judge was entirely correct in taking into account the fact that the Applicant had been placed on such a bond for another offence of violence, and by virtue of that bond it had been both drawn to the attention of, and accepted by, the Applicant that he needed to address his drug and alcohol problems. 

37It was very much to the Applicant's advantage that the Crown was prepared to accept the plea to the primary offence with the assaults on the other two victims being merely put on a Form 1. 

38All of these matters lead to the view that, even if error had been shown, no other sentence would have been warranted. 
Conclusion 

39The orders I propose are these: 

(1) Extend the time for leave to appeal to 10 October 2011; 

(2) Leave to appeal; 

(3) Appeal dismissed.

		20 March 2012",2012-03-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708434,Regina v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: This is an appeal brought by the Crown pursuant to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Act"") against the directed verdict of acquittal given following the conclusion of the Crown case on the trial of the respondent for the manslaughter of MG (""the deceased"").

2Prior to the trial the subject of the appeal, the respondent had stood trial for both the murder and the manslaughter of the deceased. The trial judge in that trial directed a verdict of acquittal. On appeal the verdict was quashed and a new trial ordered on the charge of manslaughter. It is from the directed verdict in that second trial that this appeal is brought.

The grounds of appeal

3The Crown relies on two grounds:

1 His Honour erred by misdirecting himself on the test of whether there is a case to answer.

2 His Honour erred in finding that it was ""usually necessary"" for the Crown, in order to establish that there was a case to answer, to identify ""the cause of death or the precise acts that resulted in that cause"" of death.

4Each of the parties accepted that an appeal under s 107 of the Act must involve a question of law alone (see s 107(2)) and that the section does not permit an appeal on a mixed question of fact and law: R v PL [2010] NSWCCA 256; (2010) 261 ALR 365 at [11]-[27].

The factual background

5The factual background set out below is taken from the judgment of the trial judge setting out the reasons for his directed verdict and the summary of trial filed by the Crown in this appeal which is accepted as correct by the respondent.

6The respondent and the deceased, MG, had been in a relationship for some years. However, there was evidence that the deceased was contemplating bringing it to an end. A friend of the deceased and respondent ('the friend') gave evidence that about a month before his death, the deceased told him that he wanted to terminate his relationship with the respondent because he was not happy, the respondent was becoming aggressive and he (the deceased) was frightened of him.

7A neighbour lived in a terrace adjoining the one occupied by the deceased and the respondent. At about 8.15am on the morning of 7 April she heard a bang, ""sounding like a shelf falling, and pots and lids falling to the ground"". She then heard what she described as a sound or singing lasting ""for 8 seconds even"". She later said, ""It could have been a word even, if it was muffled, it was - I didn't know what it was - it was a shout or a roar. It could have been somebody saying something or crying out"".

8She gave evidence that at about 8.45am she heard some further noise from the adjoining premises. She said she could hear ""somebody crying like a child, having a temper tantrum crying that type of cry, you know, not really crying. It was like roaring or having a tantrum"". She said it was the respondent who was crying but she could not identify the persons she had heard shouting earlier. She said the respondent's crying or wailing continued for about 10 to 20 minutes. 

9On the morning of 7 April 2007, the wife of the friend of the deceased and respondent telephoned their residence at around 9.00am. The person who answered the telephone, believed by her to be the respondent, was crying on the end of the line sounding really upset and hysterical. She then rang her husband and daughter and told them to go to the house.

10At 9.12am on 7 April, the respondent made a 000 phone call. The transcript of the call records him saying, ""I have a fight with my friend"". The operator is recorded saying, ""I beg your pardon?"" and the respondent is recorded replying, ""I have a fight with my friend and my friend dead"". 

11The friend gave evidence that after receiving a call from his wife he went to the house in which the deceased and the respondent were residing. He could see the respondent ""scream his head off"" sitting with the deceased's body. He remembered the respondent saying, ""I want my [MG], [MG], wake up, [MG]"". 

12The ambulance officer, a Mr Lawrence Agars, attended the house and saw the respondent sitting at the bottom of the staircase with his back to the front door, the deceased lying on his back with his head elevated on a pillow in the respondent's lap. He said the respondent was hysterical and he was wailing very loudly. Officer Agars said there was what appeared to be a tiny smear of blood on the wall of the stairs but he was unsure if he put it there with his gloves. He also noted a metal object, a small pot with a spout, near the deceased's legs.

13The police officers who arrived soon after observed that the respondent had what appeared to be blood on the top that he was wearing at the time.

14After the respondent had been handcuffed and cautioned, he was heard saying to Senior Constable Simkins, ""It's too late. I need my medication"". Senior Constable Simpkins asked what had happened that morning and he replied, ""He had a fight"". He was asked what the fight was about but he only replied, ""I want my medication"".

15A Mr Raymond Carter, a former partner of the respondent and also a friend of the deceased, attended Redfern Police Station. He saw the respondent was crying and hysterical. After a time the respondent told him, ""We had an argument"" and ""I was making carrot juice. [MG] kept at me"" and then started sobbing even more.

16At 3.30pm on the afternoon of 7 April, Detective Hamill cautioned the respondent. The respondent said, ""No I didn't murder him, he's not dead he is only in hospital"". Detective Hamill said, ""No [MG] is dead. Can you tell me what happened?"". The respondent replied, ""I don't remember. We have breakfast, [MG] argue with me. He criticise me a lot"". The respondent then said, ""Oh, [PL]"" (himself) and then ""Then my head starts spinning. Then I don't know what happened"".

17A Detective Griffin attended the premises on 7 April 2007. He noticed what appeared to be a bloodstain on the northern wall near the deceased and an apparent smudge of blood on the doorway and handrail of the stairs. There was an apparent bloodstain smeared on the part of the juicer on the floor near the deceased, but no blood on the floor. No scientific testing was done to determine whether what Detective Griffin saw was in fact blood.

18Dr Paull Botterill was the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy on the deceased. In his opinion the cause of death was blunt force head and neck injuries. Both head and neck injuries would be possible causes of death. Whilst either could have resulted in death, it was more likely that the combination of them was responsible for the death. Dr Botterill noticed the following injuries at the autopsy:

1 Tears over the skin of the right side of the chin.

2 Tears, grazes and bruises under the chin.

3 Multiple tears to the skin and bruises over the front of the neck and upper front of the chest.

4 Bruising beneath the skin at the back of both sides of the head.

5 A tear of the lining of the inside of the mouth near the right lower lip.

6 Some blood over the surface of the brain.

7 Bruises to the left back and hip region, and 

8 Multiple bruises under the skin of the right arm, left forearm, right wrist and knuckles of both hands.

19Dr Botterill stated that although any of the individual injuries might have been associated with a simple fall, the extent and distribution of the injuries was more in keeping with multiple, blunt force contacts. A fall down the stairs may have accounted for some of the injuries but not all of them. He stated it was possible that the cross-type laceration to the deceased's chin was caused by contact with the metal part of the juice extractor. He agreed, in answer to questioning from the trial judge, that in relation to the neck injuries it was difficult to be more accurate than that they had occurred within a 24 hour period before death. However, he stated that if one knew the neck injuries had been inflicted six or eight hours before death, he would defer to the head injuries as the cause of death.

20Dr Botterill inspected the area around the staircase in the house. In his opinion a fall from the landing partway up the staircase could not result in the constellation of injuries on the deceased. He could not conceive of the deceased's injuries being caused by a fall from the top of the stairs, except for the ""theoretical possibility"" of a person having a seizure and repeatedly moving their body along a surface to produce the pattern of bruising on the chest, but he had never seen such in a situation in his experience. 

21Dr Michael Rodriguez was the neuropathologist who examined the deceased's brain at the request of Dr Botterill. His principal diagnosis was that the brain was subjected to blunt force injury. He said that there was a significant movement of the central structures of the brain and the injury to the central part of the brain was by far the most serious of the deceased's brain injuries. He stated possible causes could include:

(a) A fall down six steps of a set of stairs.

(b) If one was hit hard enough over the head with the part of the juice extractor.

(c) If a person was in a physical altercation, was pushed backwards and fell and hit his head on a wooden floor.

The reasoning of the trial judge

22Early on in his judgment the trial judge stated the test to be applied in determining whether or not to direct a verdict of acquittal. He referred to the principle as stated in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212 to the following effect:

""There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct ... [a verdict of not guilty] if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict.""

23His Honour accepted that ""evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by contradicting, qualifying, or explaining the evidence supporting a conviction is to be disregarded: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74"", and that questions of credibility and reliability are for the jury to determine, not the judge. He stated the mere fact that in a circumstantial case it is possible to formulate a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence which the prosecution has failed to exclude cannot justify a direction that the jury should acquit if there is evidence upon which the accused could be convicted.

24The parties accepted that in this part of his judgment (pars [2]-[4]) the trial judge articulated the correct principles.

25The trial judge set out the evidence and summarised the Crown case in the following terms (at [18]):

""The Crown, in brief, submitted that the medical and scientific evidence, the timeline, the tension in the relationship, the lack of any other person with opportunity, what was heard by the neighbour and the statements of the accused permitted the inference that the deceased was strangled and/or hit over the head (either with the juicer bowl or otherwise) by the accused although it is unclear in which order these acts are said to have occurred. (Given that the accused was on trial for manslaughter and not murder, the possible financial gain that might have been a motive was not relied on.)""


26The critical portions of the trial judge's judgment are at pars [20]-[22]. It is convenient to set them out in full:

""[20] It is clear that identification of the cause of death or the precise acts that resulted in that cause need not be identified in every case, though it is obviously usually necessary to do so in order to show that it is the accused who was responsible. Here, the crucial question is whether the deceased's death was caused by the unlawful and dangerous act of the accused. There can be no doubt that answering this question requires focus on what the jury are able, as a matter of common sense and reason, to conclude from the evidence as a whole. The mere fact that the Crown case is possible could not, of course, justify a conviction. The evidence must be such that the accused could, though not necessarily would, lawfully be convicted upon it: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; (1955) 92 CLR 654 at [7]. 

[21] It is important, indeed crucial, to understand that reasoning by inference is an essential part of the jury's consideration of the charge and that this may not always be capable of clear articulation, as is evidenced by the injunction frequently given that common sense has a significant part to play in drawing inferences. Of course, technical medical evidence is not a matter of common sense but of expertise, though its significance may well depend on common sense inferences derived from other material. That material, and how it impinges on or is affected by the medical evidence and, ultimately on the issues in the case, are matters for the jury to evaluate. Given the time frame in which it is possible that the injuries were suffered and the uncertainties of the cause of death, the surrounding circumstances - so far as there is evidence of them, are crucially important. Thus, for example, the juicer bowl may have inflicted the laceration to the deceased's chin, but was it wielded by the accused and, if so, in what circumstances? If he had used it, why did he leave it there in full sight and, if it were bloodstained, why was there no blood on the floor? If the deceased fell down the stairs why did the accused not mention it? This would require consideration, amongst other things, of his mental state at the time he spoke. If saucepans falling to the floor explains the noise heard by the neighbour, how did this happen and what inferences arose from it? Was it merely the sound of the juicer bowl hitting the floor and, if so (since it was thrown at the wall above the kitchen door), who threw it and why? Did it cause an injury to the deceased and, if so, in what circumstances? For example, did it cause any serious injury or one or more that was or were relevant to the deceased's death? Did the deceased fall down the stairs and could this event occur independently of the accused and, if not, did the accused do it deliberately or accidentally or in self defence? I mention these matters by way of example only - the range of factual issues is much wider of course. At the end of the day, one must remain acutely aware that inferences may be able to bridge any apparent gaps in the Crown case. 

[22] Accepting, however, that there is no bright line separating 'conjecture' from common sense or inferential reasoning, the evidence must be such as to enable a lawful verdict of guilt. Much might be left uncertain but a judge must direct acquittal where, in his or her view, a guilty verdict would necessarily involve inadmissible conjecture. Inevitably, this will be a matter of fact and degree. In some cases, the multiplication of circumstances, taken together (though ignoring those matters that assist the accused), will be capable of leading to a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify conviction, in which event, there is a case to answer. Here, however, the number of possibilities and the varying inferences available if one or another path of reasoning be followed add to uncertainty rather than reduce it. The choice of path is fraught with considerable doubt and each has substantial gaps. So far as the medical evidence pertaining to the event or events that caused death, a very significant complicating feature is the evidence, not given at the first trial, of the 24-hour time frame in which the injuries may have been suffered. Amongst other things, this made it distinctly less important than it earlier appeared that a fall down the stairs almost certainly did not explain all the injuries.""

Ground 1

The submissions of the Crown

27The Crown focused on par [22] of the judgment of the trial judge stating that although he had articulated the correct test earlier in his reasons, his statement in that paragraph: ""In some cases, the multiplication of circumstances, taken together (though ignoring those matters that assist the accused), will be capable of leading to a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify conviction, in which event, there is a case to answer"", erroneously stated the test to be applied. The Crown stated that this was not the correct test. Its submissions emphasised that a directed verdict is not available merely because a judge believes a verdict would be unsafe or unsatisfactory. It was submitted that the trial judge contemplated a variety of factual scenarios and integral to his reasoning was that it was relevant to consider situations in which the strength of the Crown case varied. It was put that this was contrary to what was said in Doney v The Queen supra and R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39, which state that the Crown case must be taken at its highest and that the trial judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence might be formulated.

28The Crown submitted that the evidence at its highest was that the act of the respondent causing the injury or injuries to the deceased which constituted an unlawful and dangerous act were caused by him during their physical altercation overheard by the next door neighbour less than an hour before the respondent finally called 000.

The submissions of the respondent

29The respondent pointed to pars [2]-[4] of the judgment of the trial judge and submitted that they did not reveal any error of law. He submitted that the reference in par [22] to ""sufficient certainty"" must be read in its context; his Honour there meaning sufficient certainty to justify a conviction without conjecture or speculation. He pointed to the fact that the trial judge stated in his reasons that it was not sufficient in a circumstantial case that there may be another reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence which the prosecution has failed to exclude to justify a directed verdict of acquittal. The respondent also sought to draw some comfort from remarks made by the trial judge during the course of argument on the issue to show that he understood the correct test.

30In addition, the respondent submitted that any error made by the trial judge was in fact an error of mixed fact and law, pointing out that the directed verdict by its very nature involved an evaluation of the evidence, that being a question of fact.

Consideration

31The principles on which a trial judge should direct a verdict of acquittal are well settled. The question is whether at the time a no case to answer submission is made the accused could lawfully be convicted on the evidence as it stood at that time: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In Doney v The Queen supra, in addition to the passage cited by the trial judge the Court made the following remarks (at 214-215, citations omitted):

""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

It is necessary only to observe that neither the power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict that is unsafe or unsatisfactory nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process provides any basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function. The power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory, like other appellate powers, is supervisory in nature. Its application to the fact-finding function of a jury does not involve an interference with the traditional division of functions between judge and jury in a criminal trial.""

32It is also clear from the authorities that the sufficiency of evidence to warrant a conviction is to be resolved without regard to evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by qualifying, contradicting or explaining the evidence in support of a conviction (see R v R supra at 81, 84-85). Further, in a case such as the present which depends in the main on circumstantial evidence, a judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case on which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated: R v JMR supra at 44.

33The learned trial judge early in his judgment correctly articulated these propositions. However, following his statement of the Crown case (at [18]) he adopted a somewhat different approach. In par [20] of his judgment he stated that the mere fact the Crown case is possible could not justify a conviction. It is difficult to see how this could be reconciled with the passage from Doney cited above to the effect that an acquittal can only be directed if there is a defect in the evidence taken at its highest which would mean it would not sustain a verdict of guilty. It is also difficult to reconcile with the statement in that case that it is not sufficient that the trial judge forms the view that any conviction would be unsafe or unsatisfactory.

34The trial judge at this point, however, did refer to May v O'Sullivan supra.

35In par [21] of his judgment, the trial judge referred to a series of alternative hypotheses which may have resulted in the death of the deceased. In par [22] as the Crown pointed out, he again referred to the need for a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify a conviction, although pointing to the difference between what he described as conjecture and commonsense or inferential reasoning.

36It seems to me that the trial judge erred in law in two respects. First, his statement of the need for sufficient certainty implied an evaluation process of the weight of the evidence as distinct from a consideration of the question of whether the evidence taken at its highest could support a verdict of guilty. Second, and related to this issue, the trial judge reached his conclusion after evaluating alternative hypotheses which it was open to the jury to consider, contrary to the approach referred to above and in particular what was said by this Court in R v JMR supra at 44. 

37There remains the issue of whether the error of the trial judge was an error of law alone or an error of mixed fact and law. It was correctly accepted by the parties that the Crown was not entitled to appeal on a question of mixed fact and law. If what the trial judge did was to wrongly apply the correct principles to the facts, that would be an error of mixed fact and law and an appeal would not lie (see Smith v R (2000) 1 WLR 1644 at 1653).

38The respondent contended that in the present case any error of the trial judge was an error of that nature and that at most the trial judge had wrongly concluded, in accordance with the correct principles, that there was not evidence on which a jury could convict, thereby committing an error of mixed fact and law.

39Although support for this argument can be derived from the correct statement of the principles in the opening paragraphs of the judgment of the trial judge, it seems to me for the reasons set out above he failed to apply these principles in reaching his conclusion, in particular in his requirement of sufficient certainty and in his consideration of various hypotheses favourable to the accused. The trial judge in these circumstances in my view, applied incorrect principles to his consideration of the issue and thereby committed an error of law alone.

40It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out.

Ground 2

41In these circumstances it is not strictly necessary to deal with ground 2. However, I do not believe there was an error of law in the comment by the trial judge that it is usually necessary to identify the cause of death to show that the accused was responsible. The trial judge stated consistently with what was said in R v PL supra that the cause of death need not be identified in every case and his expression of the view as to what would generally be required did not constitute a legal error.

42However, the comment was unhelpful. What his Honour was required to do in considering whether or not there was evidence on which a jury could convict in a circumstantial case of this nature, was to consider the evidence as a whole (see R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [46]), ignoring alternative hypotheses, to determine whether it was open to the jury to convict on that evidence. What is or is not usually necessary is irrelevant to that consideration.

Discretion

43There remains the question of whether this Court should quash the acquittal under s 107(5) of the Act and if so whether it should exercise its powers under s 107(6) to order a new trial. Whilst not directly addressing the issue raised under s 107(5), the respondent contended that a new trial should not be ordered. He contended that a conviction following a retrial would likely be overturned on appeal as unreasonable, that it was the second directed verdict by a Supreme Court judge, that an order for a retrial would undermine community confidence in the criminal justice system and that the respondent had clearly suffered from four months imprisonment, strict bail conditions and the stress and uncertainty surrounding the Crown appeals.

44The Crown submitted that a new trial should be ordered, pointing to the fact that the charge involved the taking of human life, a matter that has always been regarded as serious. The Crown also pointed to the fact that prior to the second trial Dr Botterill, having viewed the premises, concluded that the likelihood of the injuries being incurred from falling down from the top of the stairs was at most a theoretical possibility and that the death resulted from a heart attack was a remote and unlikely possibility. The Crown in those circumstances submitted that the circumstantial case was a strong one.

45The manner in which the discretion should be exercised was considered by this Court in R v PL supra. In that case Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, made the following comments at [88]-[93]:

""[88] In a passage frequently cited by Australian Courts, Black J said in Green v United States, 355 US 184 at 187-188 (1957): 

'The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.'

[89] Accordingly, there are circumstances in which the courts will order a stay of a second prosecution. (See, eg, Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [116]-[118]). 

[90] In my opinion, in the context of an appeal against an acquittal by directed verdict, this Court should exercise its discretion not to order a new trial if it is satisfied that a conviction would be overturned as unreasonable, or on any other basis which would not result in a new trial on a successful conviction appeal. 

[91] Although, on the authority of R v R, the trial judge cannot direct a verdict on that basis, the principle of double jeopardy, notwithstanding its partial abrogation, remains a fundamental principle of our criminal law. It should be given effect in the manner I have indicated. 

[92] The Crown relied, on the exercise of the discretion, on the principle that the Court should not constrain the prosecutorial discretion. In Maxwell v The Queen (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 512: 

'Our courts do not purport to exercise control over the institution or continuation of criminal proceedings, save where it is necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process or to ensure a fair trial.'

[93] If this Court formed the opinion that an appeal from a new trial would be upheld, then that new trial would constitute a relevant abuse of process.""

46In that case the Court, applying these principles to broadly similar facts to the facts which emerged at the second trial, ordered a new trial on the ground of manslaughter but not of murder.

47It is not necessary to deal in detail with the competing contentions of the parties as to the strength of the case against the respondent. Suffice to say that on the evidence outlined above, particularly the fact that the respondent and the deceased were alone in the house, the sounds heard by the neighbour, the statements of the respondent made on 7 April 2007 and the evidence of Dr Botterill, is it by no means certain that a jury verdict of guilty would be set aside as unreasonable. 

48So far as the other matters put by the respondent are concerned, this undoubtedly is a tragic case. However, having regard to the gravity of the offence, it seems to me ultimately a matter for the prosecutorial authorities to determine whether or not to proceed further against the accused. Those authorities undoubtedly would take into account the fact that a further trial will be a third trial and the other matters put by the respondent in this appeal in making that decision.

49In these circumstances, in my opinion, the Court should make the following orders:

1 Appeal allowed.

2 Verdict of acquittal on charge of manslaughter quashed.

3 Order a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.

50SIMPSON J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

51ADAMSON J: I agree.

2708435,R v White & ors (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 466,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown proposes to adduce evidence from Ms Vikki Mazzaracca in relation to a purchase of cable ties at the Mitre 10 store in Casino on 15 December 2008. 

2Briefly, it is alleged that the accused, Jessica Birkensleigh, was the person who made the purchase. It is also the Crown case that the cable ties obtained by that purchase were used in connection with the murder of the deceased, Mr Saaid Zaiter.

3The crux of Ms Mazzaracca's evidence is that somebody purchased a packet of black cable ties on 15 December 2008 at 1.35pm at the C.S & B Mitre 10 Solutions Store at 127 Walker Street, Casino. The purchase price was $14.95 and a cash withdrawal of $110 was made, so the total transaction was $124.95.

4The Crown case is that this purchase occurred before Mr Stephen Orams and the accused Rodney White attended the cabin at Chinderah on 15 December 2008 when the accused White was expecting or hoping to meet with the deceased.

5Mr Johnston, on behalf of the accused Birkensleigh, objects to the admissibility of Ms Mazzaracca's evidence. In brief, his submission is that there is no evidence linking his client to the purchase of the cable ties and no evidence that such cable ties as were purchased were taken to the cabin at Chinderah and used in connection with the murder.

6The Crown case that the accused Birkensleigh purchased the cable ties on the occasion in question is circumstantial; it relies on a number of matters that I will briefly relate.

7Ms Birkensleigh set a reminder or alarm on her mobile phone for 7.45am on 15 December 2008, ""Zip ties tape"".

8Next, Ms Birkensleigh did in fact go to the Mitre 10 store in Casino on 15 December 2008, according to the undisputed evidence in that respect of Mr Orams. Mr Orams was unable to say what was purchased by Ms Birkensleigh except that she came out with an item or items in a bag. 

9The card used in the purchase at the Mitre 10 store, according to the store records, was a NAB Visa card. The records include the number and expiry details of the card. The accused White, who was then the boyfriend of the accused Birkensleigh, had a NAB EFTPOS card according to NAB Bank records. His account was debited with an amount of $124.95 in respect of a purchase and cash withdrawal at the Mitre 10 store at Casino on 15 December 2008. 

10Next, there is a clear inference available to be drawn that the same card was used to pay for accommodation at the Glenn Villa Caravan Park at Casino on 19 December 2008. The caravan park records show that a NAB Visa card, with the same number and expiry as that used at the Mitre 10 store, was used at 9.18 a.m. This transaction was also debited to the accused White's bank account according to NAB Bank records. 

11There is evidence already before the jury (Exhibit W) that it was a female who used that card at the caravan park. She told the proprietor that her surname was Folinazzo. This happens to be the surname of the accused Birkensleigh's mother, Anne Maria Folinazzo. There is evidence of other use by the accused Birkensleigh of the surname Folinazzo in documents found at the place where she was arrested in Victoria on 4 September 2009. 

12Further, the female who used the name Folinazzo at the caravan park gave an address which was identical to that of Ms Birkensleigh's mother's address in Victoria. 

13The evidence of Mr Orams, which was not disputed, is that he took the accused Birkensleigh to a caravan park to book into a cabin at about 9.00 a.m. on 19 December 2008 (T170). 

14Next, there is an inference available that Ms Birkensleigh also used a card attached to Mr White's bank account when making an airline reservation. Mr Orams' evidence is that on the morning of 19 December 2008 he took Ms Birkensleigh to a travel agency in Casino where she booked a flight to Melbourne for the Saturday morning, 20 December. An airline booking was made at the Casino Travel shop in the name of Jessica Birkensleigh at a cost of $372 and it was made at about 9.02am on 19 December 2008 (statement of Janeice Pashby). There is a corresponding entry in the record of Mr White's bank account by way of a debit of $372 at 9.04am on 19 December 2008.

15In my view there is an inference quite clearly available for the jury to draw that Ms Birkensleigh used the accused White's NAB Visa debit card at the caravan park and at the Casino Travel shop. If that inference is drawn, it strongly supports the inference that she also used that card for the purchase of the cable ties at the Mitre 10 hardware store on 15 December 2008. 

16The second issue is whether the cable ties purchased at the Mitre 10 store were used in the murder. 

17The prosecution witness, Peter Elefsen, is expected to give evidence that he saw the body of the deceased in the cabin at Chinderah and it was bound with cable ties. The hands and probably the feet were so bound. His evidence is expected to also be that shortly prior to the body being disposed of, the cable ties were removed and burnt. Burnt cable ties were subsequently found by police near to where the body had been disposed of and where Mr Elefsen had said they had been burnt.

18More cable ties were found in the cabin when police later conducted a search. They were of a similar type to those available at the Mitre 10 store in Casino. It will be open to the jury to infer that these were left over from a quantity that were purchased and taken to the cabin.

19There is evidence of cable ties having been purchased by a police officer at the Mitre 10 store at Casino in late January 2009 (Exhibit E). This is a packet of cable ties of the same description of those involved in the transaction at the Mitre 10 store on 15 December 2008. Cable ties which were found by the police at the cabin, (Exhibit F) are of a similar dimension and appearance as those in the packet from the Mitre 10 store. 

20In my view, having regard to all of those matters, it would be open to the jury to infer that the accused Birkensleigh purchased cable ties at the Mitre 10 store on 15 December 2008. It would also be open to the jury to infer that those cable ties were used in connection with the murder. The evidence is relevant, it is admissible and no basis has been otherwise suggested for it to be excluded.
